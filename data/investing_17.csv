1. After some research on Fama/French Factors I want to introduce the factor of Value and Quality into the Developed market stock ETFs tracking **MSCI World Sector Neutral Quality Index** and **MSCI World Enhanced Value Index** (if you know better index to use please let me know, these are the ones I found that I can invest -VTV for example is unavailable in EU- but would like to see alternatives). Equal weight between the 2
2. Introduce a size factor with Small Caps but with focus on Value since this is the portion of the SC that gives better returns. The only option here for me is mixing **MSCI US Small Cap Value** and **MSCI EU Small Cap Value**, unluckily I don't have options for World Small Cap Value in EU. Here I would overweight US Small Cap to sort of recreate a total market cap weight.
3. After long thoughts I decided to exclude Emerging Markets from the portfolio, since I am reading a lot on it and I am starting to get convinced that the risk/return is not so appealing due to more uncertainty of the political and financial landscape of these countries.

I have done different backtests and the results are interesting. First of all I noticed that there was a quite strong volatility and playing around with different hedges I have seen that a 10% Gold reduces yearly return of less than 0.1% on 25 years period but mitigates significantly the volatility. I am not a fan of Gold but I added into the test portfolio that is now as following

&amp;#x200B;

* **35% MSCI World Sector Neutral Quality Index ETF (XDEV)**
* **35% MSCI World Enhanced Value Index ETF (XDEQ)**
* **12.5% MSCI US Small Cap Value ETF (ZPRV)**
* **7,5% MSCI EU Small Cap Value ETF (ZPRX)**
* **10% Gold ETF (SGLD)**

I have then backtested it against SP500 (last 25 years)

7,investing,"Trading is a zero-sum game. Money is only ever made at the expense of someone else. If you profited off of a trade, that means the one on the other side of the trade lost money on the opposite side of the trade. And hedge funds have the advantage and can fill the trade instantly at the correct price and you’ll never react quick enough, and the lag is against you. This is why trading is equivalent to gambling.

Also, on average since 1970, all stores of value (gold, stocks, real estate) have only kept up with the increase in M2 money supply. Therefore, there is no investing really, there is only saving your value while the dollar devalues against your assets. 

I argue that an increase in money supply devalues the existing dollar supply proportionally.

Ever since the depart from the gold standard in 1970, the M2 money supply has increased on average 7.1% annually over the past 52 years (in 1970, M2 was $590billion. Today, M2 is $20.8trillion.)

Coincidentally (if you believe in them), S&amp;P500 has appreciated at 7.9%, gold has appreciated at 7.8%, and average home price has appreciated at 6.4% over the same 52 year period (S&amp;P500 was $83 in 1970, and $4,400 today. Gold was $38 in 1970, and $1,900 today, average home price was $17k, and is $416k today). 

It just so happens that the only stores of value (stocks, gold, real estate) have appreciated almost proportionally to the increase in M2 money supply over the same period. There are times when stocks boomed independent of gold and real estate, and vice versa, but over the 52 period they all correct back to the norm in accordance with the increase in money supply.

But inflation is only 3-4% right? Why is the money supply growing at 7.1% then.

The answer is because, officially, inflation is measured by the consumer price index (calculated by government paid statisticians tasked with formulating a subjective basket of goods they deem representative of all of consumer’s needs). However, the CPI does not actually measure inflation, it measures what the consumer is able to spend. Naturally, if a good becomes too expensive for a consumer to purchase, then the consumer is not able to purchase it. Therefore, it will get rebalanced out of the basked of goods. 

It just so happens that the average salary was $9,800 in 1970 and is $60k today. This is 3.55% average annual increase in average salaries over 52 years, which is almost exactly half the rate at which the M2 money supply has been increasing over the same period. 

Another amazing coincidence is that one ounce of gold in 1970 could purchase about 211 cheeseburgers back then at $0.18 per average cheeseburger. In 2021, an ounce of gold at $1,800 could also purchase you about the same number of cheeseburgers at $7.87 per average cheeseburger. Indeed, gold and average cheeseburgers prices have maintained 1:1 trading pair over the past 50 years.

Now there are some exceptions to this trend. Computers, for example, do not store their value. My cell phone cost $500 today, but would have cost $50million in 1970. Computers do not store their value over time since they are quickly made obsolete every year.

However, I argue that any asset that stores its value well will appreciate proportionally to the increase in money supply over a long period of time.

TLDR; stocks, gold, average house prices, cheeseburgers, and M2 money supply have all increased at roughly the same 6-8% rate annually on average since the depart from the gold standard in 1970. CPI measures only what consumers are able to spend (which is limited on their salaries) and doesn’t accurately reflect the actual inflation rate of the money supply.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading is a zero-sum game.

2. Real-time SMS alerts for especially large movements throughout the day in order to be the first to know about an event. This ultimately allows for more time to assess the situation.

3. Stocks listed on reports have a link to a single page for users to quickly assess next steps

1. If a stock sees a significant movement, the report will include that stock for the next few days even if it has stabilized — I’d like to see what it’s doing.

Market cap = shares outstanding \* stock price

Say, for example, AMC does a 10:1 reverse stock split so shares outstanding goes from 58,000,000 to 550,000,000.

The stock price obviously increases as well. Well if stock price and shares outstanding increases why wouldn't this increase market cap?

Chatgpt says this is understandably wrong and Reverse splits involve shares outstanding decreasing. Well, this is confusing to me too. If shares outstanding decreases then why did AMC's increase?

""Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday called for more vigilance in the fight against inflation, warning that additional interest rate increases could be yet to come.

While acknowledging that progress has been made, the central bank leader said inflation is still above where policymakers feel comfortable. ""

Having listened to Powell's speech, he mainly pointed out that core PCE inflation is still too high at 4.1%. While headline inflation is lower right now at 3%, as soon as energy (or food) prices would go higher again, something you can expect going into winter, also headline inflation will go higher again if core inflation doesn't push back against it.

**So expect more hikes. Energy prices will move higher towards winter and if core doesn't come down drastically, overall inflation will stay high or move even higher. That's what Powell was basically referring to. His preferred indicator is core PCE minus housing.**

**Note:** Fed's own Nowcasting shows **PCE for August at +0,6%**, way above the number for July even when adding some room for error with their forecast.

How does one calculate a total projected portfolio growth when dollar cost averaging? I don't even know if that's phrased well enough, so I'll try to explain what I mean.  
  
The SP500 has a growth of \~51% over the last 5 years, which is an average return of \~8.59% annually.  
  
If one is to dollar cost average, say yearly of the same amount and a ""fixed"" 8.59% annual return for simplicity, the growths at the end of the 5th year: the initial investment made at the start of year 1 is +51%, the 2nd year investment is +39%, the 3rd year investment is +28%, the 4th year investment is 17.9%, the 5th year investment is +8.6%.  
  
The total portfolio growth at the end of the 5th year is therefore \~+28.9%.  
  
If one makes a 6th year contribution, which has 0% growth, the portfolio growth drops to 24%. But by the end of the 6th year it's up to 33%.  
  
Is there a way to calculate that growth number with inputs for years of investing, DCA amount, DCA frequency, average annual rate of return?  
  
I guess even more importantly, is this metric even important? I don't really see ""total growth"" represented and the focus is always that annualized average growth. I'm just curious after say 30 or 40 years of investing, what's the total gain on the portfolio? One would constantly be averaging in that 0% at their latest DCA contribution, but the older investments would (hopefully) have a very high return while newer investments are still low just based on time spent in the market.  
  
Obviously it's understood some percentages are higher, some are lower or even negative, and the annualized average is historically near that 8% (call it 6-10%ish).

As stock markets, in their true global nature, only became a thing in the last century, it's obvious that World War I and II have seen stock markets go through extreme volatility.

We never fully recovered from this one.  
A positive example is the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when the German DAX soared in the following years, showing a positive economic outlook, but many European countries gaining independence in those years have suffered from the opposite effect.

Problem is, the holdings they were using are ""institution customers only"" funds that are kind of built for wealth managers to tool around with (and get paid a lil extra too). So that means they have huge expense ratios and I think some other stuff I don't understand... Stuff that makes them not really the best option for a personal investor to have.

They are Russell Tax Managed funds with expense ratios around 0.9-1.0%. It's a basic mix of bonds and stocks, only about 7 holdings total. Unfortunately one of them was *never* sold since 2017, so it has a huge capital gain. I don't know how to get rid of it at this point without incurring a ton of taxes.

I think I can manage some of the other holdings, a couple of them are a net loss, even after 8 years somehow... so I think I could offset that by selling one with an equal net gain.

But yeah, it's a process I think, and I'm on the fence about doing it at all. I don't know if it's worth it to mess around with it at this point, aside from just rebalancing every so often.

58,investing,"My dad set up a gift fund for me 20 years ago.

  
I have been pulling some out and transferring it into an individual investment account where I can actively manage it. I just realized though that the money I pull out will be taxed as income, and the same with the profits I eventually pull out of the new account. I obviously want to avoid having the money taxed twice...

  
**My question** Is there a tax law that allows for the money I put directly from one investment account into another investment account to not be taxed? I know if I did a transfer between brokers it's not taxable, which is essentially what I did except that it stopped in my personal checking account for a couple of days.

  
Any advice/help is appreciated... Thank you!!

1) Every Tuesday evening: Put $100 into investment of choice.
2) Conditionally, if the asset has dropped in value by 5% or more over 7 days, put another $100 into the same investment.

Is this still considered dollar cost averaging? Also does it go against the principles of sticking to a plan and not letting your emotions influence your decision  making? To me it seems like a form of speculation. I'm really just trying to stick to a plan and following through with it.

Even though I spot deep low good spot, I buy them some 10% or 20% of cash and sell them early to book profit, never had a guts to hold it.

Most of the times, I am missing the boat, continuous growth. I still feel bearish and trading then and there.

In my past, I bought TSLA at $41, NVDA at $55, FB at $50 and GOOGL $120. Had I kept those, I would have been multi millionaire by now, but sold everything with trading mindset.

I have $1,000 to my name personally. My income is only $1,000/fn until I start working. I am lucky enough to be on a disability support pension due to... horrific circumstances. 

Currently unsure whether I will study financial services further and growing up I always imagined I would have my own business (I see the irony).

1. Would be wise for me to start a superfund to make sure I am insured if I get a terminal illness or something bad happens out of my control.   
2. What are some smart investment options for someone like me. 

Does anyone have any insight in what would be smart to do starting from zero at 31. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is embarrassing but I am choosing to own it and move forward. I know it is not legal to give financial advice potentially even through discussions online but I thought it was worth a shot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I am a recovered addict. I used to work in finance as a mortgage broker, e-commerce underwriter etc. but I fell into bad habits and although I was working since fourteen I was never able to save due to ADHD/CPTSD. I&amp;#39;ve earned well over $600,000 and have nothing to show for it. Now recovered and diagnosed I am 31 with no super, no real expenses as my family is comfortable at the moment. I have $1,000 to my name personally. My income is only $1,000/fn until I start working. I am lucky enough to be on a disability support pension due to... horrific circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently unsure whether I will study financial services further and growing up I always imagined I would have my own business (I see the irony). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am wondering, as I am in the dark on&lt;/p&gt;

97,investing,"I’ll try and keep it short- I’ve been spending the past few months trying to get my financial house in order and set up a boring boglehead style retirement strategy. My particular situation makes this confusing and I’m looking for any suggestions. Over 45yo / Married w 2 children/  Combined yrly income of about 350k and I live in a very HCOL city,  so with childcare and shelter, we’re pretty comfortable and have some extra $ each month. 

Firstly, I’m vested into a pension plan with my union that says I can expect to be getting about 2k per month when I retire. Not enough to live on in 20 years where I live. 

Secondly, I had a small non-active rollover IRA that I just reactivated, maxed out and invested in broad market funds through fidelity.

I’ve also just set up two 529s for my kids that I put money in each month. 

So, here I am with only a small pension and an underfunded (newly) maxed out RolloverIRA. So now I’m looking for additional options to supplement my retirement to make up for the lost time. I talked with a fidelity advisor and he pointed out that I really don’t have many options. Because I’m considered a “high income earner” (even though living in this city + childcare bleeds me dry) ..with an over 250k income, I am not allowed to even set up a personal 401k, Roth, SEP IRA, or any other tax advantaged vehicle.

So what then are my options? How does one strategize a retirement when all the tax advantaged vehicles are for &gt;200k income earners?  Am I stuck with just a small pension, social security,  and whatever this Rollover IRA makes over the next 20 years? Is the stock market ETF my only safe-ish option to put money into and hope I make up lost investment time? 

TLDR: Small pension + recently started Rollover IRA. What other catch-up retirement investment options are there for some one who makes over the 250k per year limit to make up for not getting started earlier?

You probably won't, because you're competing with bunches of other people who are smarter than you. Generally people are just taking more risk than they realize.

What about the opposite? Excluding stocks or sectors you consider junk whilst holding the market portfolio otherwise. For instance, if you held every bank stock but Credit Suisse over the past few years, you would have outperformed the sector. If you held every sector but crypto, you would have outperformed the market.

I heard of one study where it was found that small cap value stocks were found to underperform the market. This made no sense to the researchers as these stocks should outperform on average since they are riskier than the market. The study corrected this discrepancy by excluding stocks that met criteria for terminal decline.

The question is can one reasonably expect to identify stocks before or during terminal decline? For instance, with all the regulatory hoopla over digital money, it is likely wise to not own coinbase or the miners because even if they don't go to zero a lot of them will inevitably terminate in liquidation.

I started investing more than a year ago. Since then, I have been reading various books and following (IMO) credible people to learn how to evaluate companies for long time investing.  
  
I still have plenty of candidates to screen that I am interested in. However, I get stuck on some now since those are companies that are young (concerning being public). So, I find it hard to make a rational decision if it is worth a buy or not.  
  
Let me explain: I am a molecular biologist and had a job interview with a company that is dealing with synthetic biology (They did not take me but I found a job somewhere else). That topic was highly interesting. I read a bit into it and realized that there is huge growth potential in this industry for the coming years. Now, since I started screening biotech companies for the beginning (since this is something I know stuff about) I sometimes encounter the issue of not being able to evaluate a company based on them being too short on the market (aside from ALL other biotech companies that are overvalued or just hard to evaluate since the Pandemic just boosted all their share prices and revenue into oblivion for 2 year).  
  
Anyway, so I am specifically talking about Twist Bioscience, Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings and Azenta (maybe also Termo Scientific, but they are way too overvalued right now). So, for those companies, I cannot apply any of the standard valuations like calculation its ""fair"" value applying growth estimates through EPS and P/E. Also, discounted cash flow model is a problem since these companies are starting out and their numbers are red. Graham’s formula or the multiple valuation model is also useless since EPS and P/E are basically non-existent.  
  
I am fan of TWST. Have been a customer in the past and now again at my new position. Also, their plans, projects, and visions of TWST and DNA sound very intriguing and the CEOs seem rational, potent, and capable.  
  
I hope you see the dilemma I am in. There are potential candidates that I think have a big growth potential with a big intrinsic value (scientifically and culturally). However, I cannot predict the fair share price value due to limiting available data.  
  
What do you do in this situation? The only thing that seems to look ""good"" are revenue data and equity growth for these companies. Is it valid to just look at these datapoints? Because ROIC, EPS, cash or P/E are non-existing or in minus. Even though for example TWIST is a well-known and reliable company that obviously has a growing revenue steam.  
  
I am happy for any tips and discussions concerning this topic. I do not want your opinion if those companies are a buy or not. I want input concerning the process of making rational discissions based on the limited data available in this case and how to guestimate (?) the potential future of such innovative but young companies.

If i have to wait 10 years for example till my portfolio becomes positive again there is a risk that i might need to takeout money because you never know what live gives to you even with the 6 months emergency fund. I am not anticipating outliving most investors like Waren Buffet. &lt;/p&gt;

Then i researched that the S&amp;P is a composite index of the 11 sectors in which IT sector is 27% and healthcare is 15% and financial is 10% and energy only 2,5%

So i thought i could shape them on my own predictions.

So my preliminary plan is following:

1000 $ iShares S&amp;P 500 Information technology sector (slight recession fears for Q1/24, still good idea? could also invest more since i expect most growth in IT sector in all the market)

1000$ iShares World Healthcare sector (etf has lost a few %, maybe the dip is there and  new vaccines about to be distributed this fall/winter and also because of demographics i expect growth in this sector)

1000$ iShares S&amp;P 500 Consumer staples (defensive even in recession)

1000$ iShares World Energy sector (i believe that energy prices will still rise and the energy corps. won't invest so much for growth and instead they will rise prises to profit because of climate change )

Because of the recent defaults in the banking sector like SVB i predict no growth rather a downturn in financial sector (10% of the S&amp;P index, might dampen the index). For consumer discretionary i am not sure. It all depends if there will be a slight recession as the current news is indicating or that is already priced in as it alwalys is in the stock market. Also if the interest rate hikes end, more growth for IT sector and probably consumer discretionary could be anticipated. For communications services sector i am not sure.

Feel free to comment on my predictions or on my strategy. Maybe i am delusional and a fool. I simply don't want to wait if the S&amp;P remains sideways for years when in fact some sectors grow and some are in downturn. Because of the broad diversification i fear that i loose potentional gains.

130,investing,"Bonds are historically mediocre at returning positive real yields, which is why I've avoided them.  But it seems to me that using bonds to bet on an interest rate reversion seems promising.

Here are the premises, as I see them:

* 30 year T-bonds are paying [4.45%](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us)

* The Fed is seeking to return to 2% inflation.  During the 2010-2019 pre-covid era, at this inflation level, [30 year bond yields were about 1.5-2%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS30)

* There are good reasons to believe that the current episode of inflation is an economic readjustment from covid era shifts in demand, not a consequence of pre-covid low rates.

* If I use the zero-coupon bond equation value for interest rate r, par value V, years Y: Price=*P=V/(1+r)^Y* I get the following 30 year 3-year-holding period  nominal-dollar profits for holding bonds through an interest rate shift from rate r1 to r2, as *Profit = [(1+r2)^(Y-3)/(1+r1)^(Y)]-1*

    * +116% profit if 30 year bond rates drop to 'normal' level of 2% after 3 years

    * +66% profit if 30 year bond rates drop to 3% after 3 years

    * 1.2% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 5% after 3 years

    * 23.5% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 6% after 3 years

    * 40% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 7% after 3 years

If one is afraid of inflation during the holding period, one could pay a similar game with TIPS, which yield over 2%, but for recent history have tended to [cluster around 1%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII30).   In this case, buying TIPS at 2% and selling in 3 years at a 1% rate would yield a 38% real-dollar profit, or about 11% a year.

Personally, I think that it is far more likely for rates to hold steady or fall back to 2%, because the 2009 to 2020 2% inflation era seemed to work OK economically.

So under this reasoning, the sensible strategy might be to bail  out of stocks, pile into long-term T-bonds, and get back into stocks if and when stock prices (P/E) readjust to more closely reflect the traditional 4% equity risk premium, roughly   P/E=1/(2% real  bond yield + 4% equity risk premium )=17.  Or even if P/E doesn't fall, holding bonds through an interest rate decline would give one a lot more money to put into modestly historically overpriced stocks.

One of my reasons is that I already invest a hefty amount into funds which have majority Apple and Microsoft. I don't want my entire life's and retirement savings to be 30% dependent on 2 stocks no matter what they are.

I have found many ETFs which buy S&amp;P500 stocks based on various performance indicators. Some are quite speculative which doesn't interest me. But others are based on things such as quality factor, cash flow, volatility, etc.

A couple of examples are MOAT which is based on companies which have a wide moat, or competitive advantage, which would be difficult for competitors to overcome. Another is SPHQ which is based on quality factor.

Both of these ETFs have a 10 year return of higher than the S&amp;P500 despite both being based on S&amp;P stocks. They're just weighted and selected differently. Clearly this has been working and those strategies logically seem like they'd be successful

My question is why are these ETFs and others like them not as popular as the most common bulk, market cap weighted S&amp;P ETFs?

&lt;p&gt;if you are downvoting or not liking this question, may i know why ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we were playing this brainstorming game among friends. and i thought investing community on reddit might be interested as well. some discussions here are quite thoughtful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;all i am getting is either downvotes or hateful messages.&lt;br/&gt;
quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is not my situation. this is not anybody&amp;#39;s situation for that matter. we were discussing an hypothetical scenario among us. we were pondering over what happens if one were able to borrow at such low rates before fed rate hikes and might be sitting on that cash. what would they do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#39;s kind of interesting that the investing community isn&amp;#39;t liking this. and i can&amp;#39;t figure out why :)&lt;/p&gt;

I assume this CD is callable at any time over the 2 year maturity period.

What I thought YTW meant was the minimum yield I would receive if the CD called before maturity. I would have expected that to be less then the coupon rate itself, so I must be misunderstanding what all of this means.

Does this all mean that I just receive the coupon rate up until the date of being called with interest accumulation ending at the call date? (Which I thought was just YTC).

investopedia: ""Yield to worst is a measure of the lowest possible yield that can be received on a bond that fully operates within the terms of its contract without defaulting.""

and

""If a bond is callable, it becomes important to look at the YTW. The yield to maturity will always be higher than the YTW (YTC) because the investor earns more when they hold the bond for its full maturity. The YTW is important though because it provides deeper due diligence on a bond with a call provision. The shorter time frame a bond is held for, the less the investor earns. YTW provides a clear calculation of this potential scenario showing the lowest yield possible.""

So, in my example above, YTM, YTC, and YTW are all the same. That doesn't make sense to me.

157,investing,"**TLDR: Why not Fed rate hike to 10%, but only with conditions of possible quick rate cuts to 2-3% for sure, and potential QE, if warranted?** 

=============================================================

So first of all I dont have Ph D in economics or not even remotely close, so bear with my ignorance. 

Going to what I want to say, and as we have witnessed that headline CPI is plummeted significantly in last 6 months, but core CPI is rather sticky and hold the line quite well. In fact, when looking at truflation data, CPI is creeping up in to 2.6% last 2 weeks. 

With this in mind, core CPI is more about service industry (i.e: travel/insurance/housing/medical expense) that often doesnt have strong basis for cost of goods sold. Unlike manufacturing jobs, service industry has no strong hold for consensus in terms of pricing. 

For example, it's like Amazon Prime membership that used to be 99$ before pre-pandemic. AMZN says it's increasing membership fee due to reason X,Y,Z but it all depends on how they net out the profits from online activity as well. What about Amazon's prime membership costs 140$, but Costco membership costs 120$? Who sets this up and for what reasons? 

Having said that, why not Fed consider madman's theory? Like let's say Fed officially announce that it may rate hike to 10% but only with multiple condition 1) that it will rate hike to 10% in next 4 months 2) depending on outcome of macro economy (i.e job reports/CPI/etc), it may not only reduce rate to 2%, but start to do QE if needed.

This will, obviously, bring chaos to financial markets (short term treasury rate will spike) and inevitable market corrections. This will also force many bankruptcy for leveraged business and many negative consequences to real economy. But, I believe that this will restore fed's credibility, which is the most important strategic assets to have in financial markets.  

But who actually trusts Fed today? Dont we all clearly remember that in late 2021, Fed expecting to rate hike, maybe early 2023? And we all know what happens in 2022. 

Like I am just so sick of one day that Morgan Stanley's talking about recession only to find out that next day Goldman Sachs talking about removal of hard landing. And this isn't much different than what we hear about governors of Fed says otherwise like one day Fed member says we are at the top of rate hike, but other day, another fed member says we should rate hike one or more.   


Current rate is 5.25 to 5.5% fed fund rate. 

Last CPI was 3.2% (headline) and 4.7% (Core), so current Fed rate is already high enough than Core CPI, isn't it? **According to Taylor's Rule, it should curb core CPI, but wouldn't it be painless if we can curb the expectations of inflation in a timely manner (rather quickly) than ""sit down and let's see what it will happen"".** 

Do I believe rate hike to 10% will increase the chance to crash the economy? Sure, that's why Fed should provide conditions such as quick rate cut to 2% if macros are proven to be crashing down. If that's factored in, maybe, the resilient economy that Fed members talk about all the time won't tank down as severe as they would think, which is why Fed can mention another conditions that they will (not could) do QE, IF needed. 

Just my thinking, but I wanted to see what other folks think about this as well.

162,investing,"I'm a 26yr M with a pretty good grip on stock investment knowledge. What makes a good investment etc etc. 
But recently with Treasury Bond yields at highs I've delved into some new research on them

I've always understood they're a long-term safe investment with a low-moderate yield. But now I'm seeing that you can buy bonds, get the yearly yield while you have it, and ALSO trade them in the process. The price of Bonds tends to increase as Fed interest rates lower, and decrease as Fed interest rates increase.

My question is: with bond yields so high right now, and the price of bonds going up when Fed interest rates go down, and a volatile uncertain market, it sounds like a REALLY great idea to put a ton of money in some bonds, get 5+% interest on them in the meantime, then when rates go down you can sell them at a profit.
I'm looking at 1month-1year Bonds. The 3-6 month Bonds seem like such a great small time window.

Is there any reason to not do this??

I haven't been able to see/find a chart of the price of bonds on the open market, only yield rates, so I don't actually know how much you can profit on a bond when Fed interest rates go down. A Futures chart isn't the open market price right? 
But overall I can't really see why I wouldn't do this unless I wanted way higher gains in the equities market. Which could also definitely happen when Fed rates lower. 

But it sounds like a great investment right now.

167,investing,"Since no one can predict the future, the general wisdom is that it is best to hold a diversified portfolio.  

As far as equities go, one could just buy something like VT, and own everything in the world in a proportional weighting.   

But then you could also buy something like VTI and VXUS and balance the weight to be something like that of VT.   

And you could further divide up VTI into its various components (small, mid, large cap) and own funds for all of those, and do similarly for VXUS, perhaps also dividing VXUS up into different funds based on things like developed markets versus emerging markets, and so on.

My understanding is that a major part of diversifying is that at any given time, some things are winning and some things are losing.   If you need to cash in on some of your investments, you want to cash in when that investment is winning, so that you don't take a loss.   

It seems to me that if you have one giant generic fund (like VT), the losers are pulling down your winners at any given time, and the winners are pulling up the losers.   You get the average of all of that activity.  

On the other hand, it would seem that if you separate out the various components of something like VT, it gives you the flexibility to cash out only your winners when you need funds.  Intuitively, it seems that this would enable you to do much better than if you hold all your stuff in a single investment, and have to cash everything in at the same time.

I'm wondering if anyone can point to any good information on this, or offer any thoughts on this.   If this is the case, what would be the merit of owning very broad mutual funds/etfs and the like?   

The main argument I can see is that owning something like VT, or VTI/VXUS allows one to easily maintain a desired weighting combined with a sort of ""set it and forget it"" mentality.   It's less fiddly.   The more funds you get into (or even specific stocks... as that would give the greatest control, of course), the more you have to track things to make sure you aren't underweighting or overweighting certain parts of your portfolio, and that is not necessarily a small task.

177,investing,"Hi there, posted this in financial planning initially but thought I might get more replies here. I'm a married 37-year-old with a kid on the way. I'm in a creative/artistic field and although I've (thankfully) done very well, there are the occasional dry periods where I'm unsure of when my next check is going to come. Because of this, I'm toying with the idea of investing some money into high-yield dividend stocks and REITS, to help get some more consistent income during those dry periods, as I'm the primary earner in our house. Was hoping to get some advice on the below dividend strategy. Here's some additional info:

&amp;#x200B;

* Spouse (35) and I (37) both have well-funded retirement accounts. For the most part, 70% of it is in VTI and 30% is in VXUS. We'll continue this strategy with future contributions.
* I am fully vested in a pension that (as of today) will pay approximately $45K a year when I retire. I believe this number will go up. I'm eligible to start collecting at 52 for a reduced amount but plan to hold out until my 60s. Note: this pension is separate from our retirement accounts mentioned above.
* Spouse has a stable high-paying job. If we had to, we could afford all of our bills with just my spouse's income. It would be tight though.
* Despite my pension, I will be eligible for SS benefits as is my spouse.
* We have about two years' worth of emergency funds sitting in a HYSA (4.65%). Given the unusual nature of my work, I try to keep a healthy amount of rainy-day money available.
* We live in a HCOL area and our home is 30% paid off.
* We fully own one car (leasing another) and student loans aren't too far from being fully paid off.

  
As I mentioned, I'm looking to invest in some high-yield dividends and REITS into a taxable brokerage account to help with the dry periods. This isn't meant to replace a salary, but instead cover bills and ensure some additional income is available if needed. When I don't need this, I will be letting the dividends DRIP. Although ideally, these stocks will grow, my main focus with this portion of my investments is stable and reliable income. Here's are the stocks/REITS I'm considering, with each making up 10% of the portfolio:  

SCHD  
JEPI  
PFE  
0  
ABR  
VNQ  
WBA  
ARCC  
EPD  
MAIN  

Altogether, these would produce approximately a 7.04% dividend yield. I'm hoping this is reasonably diversified, though I realize there's probably some overlap. What are your thoughts on this strategy? Does this make sense given my situation? Are there some other stocks I should consider? Right now I'm diversified between ten stocks, would you expand that to 20 (with each making up 5%) for added protection? Please feel free to poke holes as I'm very much in the early research phase of this plan.

Hello everyone.   
This might be a silly question, but one I would like some answers to nonetheless.   
There is a stock I've been following lately and I have noticed the price has remained relatively flat for a while. Volume fluctuates but typically the price doesn't move.  
So, here is my hypothetical scenario question based on what I've seen with this stock-  
A company has 1M outstanding shares, and every day the volume fluctuates between 10k and 50k shares, the price per share doesn't change. Every day, the stocks are bought and sold at 5 cents.  
If I check the level 2 quotes and buy all shares available for 5 cents and hold them, then wait for more to be up for sale at 5 cents or less, and I continuously buy every share that is available at 5 cents or less, eventually, the stock wouldn't go below 5 cents? If I end up buying every share in the company and don't put them up for sale, will the price go up as people bid higher? Or will the price only hit what I'm willing to sell them at? If I choose to sell 10k shares at 10 cents but the highest bid is 8 cents, does the price say 10 or 8, or fall in the middle? Lastly, if I choose to sell at 10 but there are no bids, is the price 0?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone.&lt;br/&gt;

Even so, when I went into this book I really just expected it to rehash things I already read in other books but perhaps more thoroughly. I wasn't entirely wrong, a lot of information had in fact been repeated, but I also wasn't entirely right. Malkiel actually has something of a unique perspective when it comes to money management so I figure it's worth sharing some of what he has to say:

* **Before you are able to take advantage of market inefficiencies, you must know the ways that the market is actually efficient** \-  Investors fall into one of two camps: active investors who pick stocks and passive investors who buy index funds. For the most part, passive investors believe everything is priced in and it would be a waste of time to try to beat the market. Meanwhile, active investors generally believe that markets are inefficient and there are ways to beat the market, provided the correct technique, analysis, and/or research. Malkiel is more of a passive investor than active, not because he believes the market is perfectly efficient, but because he thinks the stock market is far more efficient than most active investors think. It's kind of like that old saying, ""you must first learn the rules before you can break them.""
* **Functionally speaking, the stock market is highly efficient in the short term...** \- Due to technology allowing us to constantly check on our portfolio's performance and investing professionals regularly being subjected to evaluations based on how much their investments appreciated in a given quarter, we tend to strive for short term gains over long term gains. The result is that in the short term, markets are highly efficient. Take for example the January effect, where stocks were consistently undervalued in January because people sold poor performing stocks in January in hopes of lowering their required tax payment. The moment this information was publicized, people rushed to buy stock in January and the renewed demand instantly erased the market inefficiency. To paraphrase Malkiel, if people know stocks will go up tomorrow, it will go up today.
* **But opportunities from market inefficiency arise in the long term** \- To clarify, by ""long term"" investing, I don't mean several months or even a year. Long term means several years, sometimes even several decades. Only in the long term do market inefficiencies correct and reveal itself as important. There are major hurtles to actually investing in a company long term. There's the difficulty of picking the right company, of needing funds for big purchases like a house, and the mental struggle of seeing the stock repeatedly and continually rise and fall in price as the years go on, constantly tempting you to sell. Because so few people are able to effectively select companies and stay invested in the long term, the market is actually much less efficient and so there are much more opportunities to beat the market. Just look at Warren Buffett.
* **Retail investors have several massive advantages over professional fund managers so don't get too discouraged when you hear that most professional investors don't beat the market** \- It's always in the wall street finance professional's interest to convince you that investing is difficult should be left to them. Malkiel disagrees, and cites several reasons for why you have an advantage over a large fund manager:

1. ***Many mutual funds aren't actually as motivated to beat the market as they should be.*** Although beating the market is ideal, it's far more preferable to get market returns than selecting stocks that perform worse than the market. For this reason, mutual fund managers sometimes just copy the index out of fear for their career. As an individual investor, you aren't doing it as a career and you aren't beholden to other investors. If you don't need the funds, you can afford to perform worse than the market for a quarter or longer in pursuit of better long term returns.
2. ***The size of a mutual fund means managers frequently have to put money in subpar companies so they're fully invested.*** It's much easier to invest $500 million in excellent companies than $50 billion - there just aren't enough investment opportunities. The cruel irony is that the better a fund manager is at generating high returns, the more people will want to invest in their mutual fund, thus ballooning the funds they have to manage and ultimately undercutting their effectiveness.
3. Another point about the size of mutual funds**:** ***when mutual funds buy stocks, it has an effect on the price.*** As a retail investor, you can buy and sell stocks for the marked price, but managers of large funds are forced to sell their stocks at a discount and buy at a premium simply due to the size of the transaction.

I should say that in this post, I've made it sound like Malkiel supports active investing. He does not. He's actually a proponent of buying index funds primarily, but also REITs, international index funds, and a bit of gold for diversification. I'm cherry picking points from the book which favors active investing because passive investing is much easier than active investing. For the passive investors reading this post, feel free to continue doing what you're doing with the knowledge that you have Burton Malkiel's full support. For the active investors, I hope some of the points raised here are helpful to you in your quest to beat the market.

Overall I found A Random Walk to be a helpful and interesting read. The book is somewhat long (the edition I read is 456 pages) so I've left quite a bit of it out due to necessity. If you guys have anything to add, definitely feel free. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; by Burton Malkiel is known as a generally good starting point for people who are new to investingIt also, as it happens, had been recommended to me by a fellow redditor as an overall correct but not too dense book that will be of actual help to personal finance newbies that does more than regurgitate financial common sense. &lt;/p&gt;

189,investing,"Storskogen is a conglomerate or an **international group of businesses** across trade, industry, and services operating in a decentralized model to acquire and develop market-leading niche companies.

It reported 2Q 2023 this week and was **trading at -28% from previous day close**

Here is a summary of Storskogen's financial performance based on their second quarter 2023 earnings release:

|Financial Metric|Q2 2022|Q2 2023|Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|SEK 9,059M|SEK 9,462M|\+4%|
|Adjusted EBITA|SEK 877M|SEK 922M|\+5%|
|Operating Profit|SEK 681M|SEK 605M|\-11%|
|Operating Margin|7.5%|6.4%|\-1.1pp|
|Net Income|SEK 474M|SEK 115M|\-76%|
|EPS|SEK 0.25|SEK 0.04|\-83%|

\- **Profit** for the period **fell 76%** to SEK 115 million.

\- The Trade business area saw lower consumer demand affecting sales and profits. The Services business area improved thanks to high occupancy rates. Industry continued to perform well.

\- Cash flow from operating activities increased significantly to SEK 852 million from SEK 335 million last year.- Net debt to adjusted EBITDA remained stable at 2.6x.

Overall, Storskogen delivered modest top line growth but profits declined amid a tougher economic climate mainly affecting consumer sentiment. The company maintained a strong financial position and cash flows improved markedly. Storskogen continues to focus on cash flow generation and profitability in the near term.

You can see YoY Income Statement and Share Price (it was listed in 2021) in the following chart:[https://snipboard.io/hlNEW8.jpg](https://snipboard.io/hlNEW8.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

It is a good business and management seem to have a good track record in the field. Let's breakdown in simple words how they make money:

&gt;*Storskogen* is a conglomerate that owns a portfolio of small and medium-sized businesses across three segments - **Trade, Industry, and Services.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The **Trade** segment includes distributors and wholesalers of physical products like home furnishings, health and beauty items, sports equipment, etc. This segment generates revenue by selling these products to retailers or directly to consumers.  
&gt;  
&gt;The **Industry** segment contains traditional industrial companies involved in manufacturing, automation, and technology services. These companies make money by producing and selling various industrial products and solutions.  
&gt;  
&gt;The **Services** segment provides business-to-business services in areas like contracting, infrastructure, installation, logistics, and more. Revenue comes from selling these services to other businesses.  
&gt;  
&gt;Storskogen aims to acquire profitable niche businesses in these segments and help them grow further under its ownership. The operating companies charge their customers for the products or services provided.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the parent level, Storskogen derives profits from the earnings of all the operating businesses it owns. By having a diversified portfolio across segments, Storskogen can maintain stable cash flows as some segments may perform better than others in different market conditions.So in summary, Storskogen generates revenue through the sales of its underlying business units and creates shareholder value by acquiring, growing and operating a diverse mix of companies. The decentralized model allows each unit to focus on its respective industry and customers.

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Profit&lt;/strong&gt; for the period &lt;strong&gt;fell 76%&lt;/strong&gt; to SEK 115 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The Trade business area saw lower consumer demand affecting sales and profits. The Services business area improved thanks to high occupancy rates. Industry continued to perform well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Cash flow from operating activities increased significantly to SEK 852 million from SEK 335 million last year.- Net debt to adjusted EBITDA remained stable at 2.6x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Storskogen delivered modest top line growth but profits declined amid a tougher economic climate mainly affecting consumer sentiment. The company maintained a strong financial position and cash flows improved markedly. Storskogen continues to focus on cash flow generation and profitability in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a good business and management seem to have a good track record in the field. Let&amp;#39;s breakdown in simple words how they make money:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Storskogen&lt;/em&gt; is a conglomerate that owns a portfolio of small and medium-sized businesses across three segments - &lt;strong&gt;Trade, Industry, and Services.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Trade&lt;/strong&gt; segment includes distributors and wholesalers of physical products like home furnishings, health and beauty items, sports equipment, etc. This segment generates revenue by selling these products to retailers or directly to consumers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt; segment contains traditional industrial companies involved in manufacturing, automation, and technology services. These companies make money by producing and selling various industrial products and solutions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Services&lt;/strong&gt; segment provides business-to-business services in areas like contracting, infrastructure, installation, logistics, and more. Revenue comes from selling these services to other businesses.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storskogen aims to acquire profitable niche businesses in these segments and help them grow further under its ownership. The operating companies charge their customers for the products or services provided.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the parent level, Storskogen derives profits from the earnings of all the operating businesses it owns. By having a diversified portfolio across segments, Storskogen can maintain stable cash flows as some segments may perform better than others in different market conditions.So in summary, Storskogen generates revenue through the sales of its underlying business units and creates shareholder value by acquiring, growing and operating a diverse mix of companies.

202,investing,"There are two ways to determine the value of something. One is for products, commodities, services, and similar items. The other is for financial instruments. In the first instance, the higher the utility derived from consuming an item, the higher its value. For example. More utility can be derived from a house, a precious metal, or a medical service, than from a tent, a base metal, or a cleaning service. That is why the first is more valuable than the second. Here however we are not interested in determining such value. Bitcoin is not a consumable item but an electronic database record. It belongs to the category of financial instruments because all such instruments are records, either paper or electronic. And in the case of financial instruments, value is determined based on payments and returns that an instrument can provide during its market life, at maturity, or at withdrawal. Let's now briefly demonstrate what that means by using the most widespread financial instruments - stocks, bonds, and fiat currencies. Then, we will determine the value of bitcoin.

During the market life of stocks, they pay dividends, while at their withdrawal for buybacks or due to liquidation of a company, they return capital to shareholders. The value here obviously depends on the size of those payments and returns. If a stock issuer can pay higher dividends and return more capital, the value of that stock will be higher, and vice versa. Bonds pay coupons during their market life and return face value at maturity. Here also, if a bond issuer can pay higher coupons and return more face value, the worth of that bond will be higher, and vice versa.

Fiat currencies pay nothing during their market life but they return items before their withdrawal from the market. Namely, when units of fiat currencies are created by loans from commercial banks or by purchasing government bonds from central banks, their beneficiaries use them to get products, commodities, services, and other items from the market. But as these units represent debt, the beneficiaries are forced to later return such items to the market to get the units for paying that debt. With debt payments, units are withdrawn from the market the same as bonds are withdrawn at maturity and stocks at buybacks or liquidation of companies. The value here depends on the size of the returns. If the beneficiaries can return more items, the value of a currency will be higher, and vice versa.

Now that we know how the value of financial instruments is determined we can turn to bitcoin. Let's first check for payments during market life. Does the issuer of bitcoin pay something like coupons or dividends to bitcoin holders? Well, no. Even in theory, this is not possible given that bitcoin is issued by a computer program, and not by some legal entity that must pay something. Let's then check for returns at maturity or at withdrawal. Here also, there is nothing to check. Bitcoin has no maturity and it is never withdrawn from the market to return something to its holders. It takes electricity when issued, but it never returns anything. As there are no payments and no returns, we can easily determine that the value of bitcoin is zero.

But what about all those narratives about bitcoin's value that circulate on legacy or social media? Well, they are just theories based on the misconception that the value of a financial instrument comes from the technology through which it is exchanged or its limited supply. Namely, given that bitcoin is easy to transfer, stored and protected in a decentralized manner, immutable, and limited in supply, the story goes that this somehow makes it valuable. But suppose that some stock broker implements the best possible technology for transferring and storing stocks. Would that change the value of these stocks? Would for example Tesla stock become mega expensive because of that? No, that is nonsensical. Such implementation would be unrelated to how much dividend Tesla can pay or how much capital it can return to shareholders. 

Or suppose that shares of a stock of a bankrupt company become limited in supply due to a reverse split. Would that magically make these shares valuable? No, given that the company has zero capital to pay or return something to shareholders. But if capital is above zero then the reduction of supply by a reverse split will automatically make shares more valuable. Limited supply affecting the value of a financial instrument presupposes the existence of value. However, just having a limited supply and nothing else cannot magically make value to appear. So, just because bitcoin as a financial instrument (electronic record) is limited in supply that doesn't make it valuable. But people are free to pay a million dollars for bitcoin just like they can do that for a share of a bankrupt company if they believe in the theory that limited supply can make value to appear. 

A lot of people have invested in bitcoin and understandably, a myriad of theories emerged about its value, with some of them being pretty weird and nonsensical. Like the one that confuses price with value and goes like this: ""The value of bitcoin is whatever someone is willing to pay for it"". According to that theory if one is willing to pay ten shares of a company ABC for one share of that company, then one share has the same value as ten shares. So pretty nonsensical. But people obviously have to rationalize their purchase of a worthless financial instrument, regardless of how unfounded their rationalizations are. After all, they have to sell it to someone else to return the investments. This forces them to invent or spread various theories about its value. In reality, however, the value of bitcoin has always been, and will always be zero. And everything that is going on around it is just the greater fool theory taken to the extreme.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to determine the value of something.

The significant decline in revenue was due to the change in revenue recognition methodology for settlement fees in 2023. Net revenue, which excludes settlement fees, increased 21%.

\*\***Previous Policy**:\*\*Up to December 31, 2022, Adyen considered itself primarily responsible for providing payment transaction services. This means they had control over the full settlement service before it was transferred to merchants. In accounting terms, Adyen acted as the ""Principal"" for these fees. When acting as a Principal:Adyen would recognize both the revenue from the fees charged to merchants and the costs from the third parties on a gross basis. This means both the revenue and the costs were shown in full in the financial statements.

\*\***Change in Policy**:\*\*In H1 2023, Adyen made changes to its terms and conditions related to merchant agreements. These changes clarified the roles and responsibilities of the services provided by third parties. The key points from this change are:Adyen does not provide a significant service of integrating the services from third parties into one combined output for the merchant.Adyen does not control the inputs from third parties before services are provided to the merchant.Because of these changes, Adyen now acts as an ""Agent"" for the pass-through settlement fees, effective from January 1, 2023.

\*\***Impact of Acting as an Agent**:\*\*When acting as an Agent:Adyen only recognizes the net amount (i.e., the difference between what they charge the merchant and what they pay to third parties) in the revenue. This means the gross revenue and the costs from third parties are no longer shown in full in the financial statements.

\*\***Financial Impact**:\*\*Looking at the financial data provided:In H1 2022 (before the change), Settlement fees were €3,641,350 and Costs incurred from financial institutions were €3,313,269.In H1 2023 (after the change), Settlement fees dropped significantly to €485,582, and Costs incurred from financial institutions were only €74,409.This drastic reduction is because, in 2023, Adyen is only recognizing the net amount in the revenue, whereas in 2022, they were recognizing the full gross amount.

This is how the Revenue growth in the last 9 Yrs looks like:[https://snipboard.io/1vM0jO.jpg](https://snipboard.io/1vM0jO.jpg)

As far as I understand, bond ETFs:

1. Hold a diverse set of bonds with different maturity dates
2. Don't hold bonds until maturity; instead, they sell bonds before maturity and buy new ones.

Now, when selling such a bond fund, there is a possibility of losing money if interest rates increase. To overcome this, there is a neat strategy: after selling my bond fund holdings, I can either:

1. Buy back all the individual bonds in the ETF and hold them until maturity (which is almost impossible to do).
2. Buy an equivalent amount of bonds with a duration that is equivalent to the average duration of the bond fund. Because the bond market is efficient, the price paid will be more or less the same as in option 1.

The problem is that buying individual bonds is not that easy for a retail investor. That's the reason I am buying a bond ETF in the first place. There are minimum requirements (like a minimum of $50k), spreads can be large, etc.

The question is crucial, but what's even more pressing is this: likely quite soon, the Federal Reserve will cut rates, and as usual, it will be a sharp cut. After that, the TMF is primed to surge to $11-12, and possibly even higher. Therefore, the extent of its dip before the upswing isn't of major concern.

All that remains now is to await the rate cuts. And of course, TMF is capable of starting its upward climb long before the actual rate cuts. Last fall, it surged 62% on expectations alone.

&lt;p&gt;All that remains now is to await the rate cuts. And of course, TMF is capable of starting its upward climb long before the actual rate cuts. Last fall, it surged 62% on expectations alone. This implies that it&amp;#39;s better to be positioned even before clear signals from the Fed become visible.&lt;/p&gt;

255,investing,"**Intro:** 

\[Very brief\]  
  
If you are long SEA I’m sure you saw the horrendous drop this morning on the news of them coming in light on revenue expectations. I personally feel like this drop is completely overblown and management’s ability to emphasize profitability and add to their cash pile over the last two quarters shows great discipline and flexibility in a changing market. They even profitably grew e-commerce by \~21% YOY and digital payment by \~50% YOY.   
  
I did a conservative sum of the parts analysis this morning where I compared SE’s three segments to comparable companies to show where a potential bottom could be and to hopefully help investors (myself) not panic sell due to this overblown move. I used P/S ratios because I don’t think EBITDA or earnings are entirely meaningful yet in the company’s current stage. **I also used a run rate for 2023 and did not assume any further growth, as to be as conservative as possible in forming the base case.**   
  
**Summary:**   
  
**Garena:**   
  
Scenario 1 - Steady State: Comparing Garena to Tencent’s P/S ratio on a 2Q23 annualized basis, so assuming no growth for the rest of 2023 but keeping the same run rate, the valuation for Garena should be \~$5.5B.   
  
Scenario 2 - P/S Comp Reduction Slashed by 50% due to Continual Decline (Ultra Conservative): Using the same assumptions as above, the value of Garena would be \~$2.7B. I believe this is ultra conservative because as we saw today, overall gaming metrics are starting to improve i.e. MAUs and % of paying users, and I think with the new title launches, should continue into future quarters.   
  
**Shopee:**   
  
Using the run rate for 2023, so again, assuming no growth, the value for Shopee is \~$14B  
  
**Sea Money:**   
  
Using the run rate for 2023, so again, assuming no growth, the value for Sea Money is \~$1.9B. I believe this is extremely conservative. I don’t think the comps (PYPL, STNE) quite capture the growth and opportunity of Sea Money due to the rapid growth and high growth region, as the P/S average used was \~2. Fintech has been under pressure recently, but historic P/S comps have ranged from 6 to 12, so if you do the math, the valuation here is much higher on a realistic basis.   
  
**Conclusion:**   
  
On a straight across basis, assuming Garena (and the other segments) keep the current run rate for the year, the valuation of the sum of the parts is \~$21B. Cutting the multiple in half for Garenas decline gives us \~$18B.   
  
That being said, these valuations assume no additional growth in the other segments, simply keeping the current run rate. That being understood, I think where it’s sitting now at $23B could be argued to be the fair price/intrinsic value, which would make sense in an efficient market.  
  
**Personal Thoughts:**  
  
It’s gut wrenching to watch a company drop like SE did today, but it’s important to table emotions and remember the game you’re playing. SE operates in a market that is going to see continual and immense growth for decades to come, well above the GDP growth % for most of the developing world. They have strong market leadership in e-commerce and even with entrants like TikTok, can still materially grow that business year over year due to low overall e-commerce market penetration.   
  
As discussed in the call, they’re also pivoting back into a growth mode for Shopee as to keep up with competitors in the region. This should boost the Shopee revenue growth rate as well as capture more sellers/buyers in the Sea Money ecosystem, providing a two-fold growth engine.   
  
I personally am going to hang tight with my 50% paper loss and wait for a lower price to add to my position (as crazy \[or not\] as that sounds). If it went any lower from current levels, especially as low as \~$18B I would see this as a clear opportunity to invest heavily, especially as the region is expected to recover in 2024 and beyond and as discussed above, I believe the gaming segment is going to continue to stabilize through the EOY.   
  
Would love to know what everyone’s thoughts are, whether long or short. GLTA.  
  
**TL;DR** \- SE is down but certainly not out. A great company that had expectations set too high in the short/medium term, but has a great growth story laid out in front of it.

Investors, 

I'm an American living in Korea, age 33. I'm exploring financial options like getting an index fund started through interactive brokers. (There are better ones, but these guys are the only ones accepting Korean Won into other currencies) 

In the meantime I'm also trying to invest long term in foreign bond markets, for Old Me. Due to me living out here, my options are stymied because I'm not a citizen and the Korean Won doesn't really play well with others...

I feel I shouldn't grab any Yankee Bonds because of the high interest rates, so I'm thinking about Arirang Bonds or Samurai Bonds. I haven't done much research into this, beyond a few links from investopedia. Before I invest some chips, im hoping for Second and Third opinions. 

I have a 2yr foreign savings account from won to USD with an exchange bank, it takes ₩1,000,000 every month from my income. I still have about ₩600,000 left after expenses and food. Its just coffee money, so I should do something meaningful with it. Any constructive advice is appreciated!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors, &lt;/p&gt;

I've been thinking of just putting the rest in VTI/VSUX and letting it sit(I'm 37) - I shouldn't need it until retirement, and then contributing any income above what I need to keep that emergency fund around ~40k as it comes in.

I don't have any debt other than my mortgage and make a little over 200k.

From a 2022 Goldman Sachs report, ""Copper is so integral to the green transition – a global effort underpinned by government support – that the supply requirements necessitate a spike in copper prices""  
**Demand will increase**  
EVs, EV charging, electrical transmission, and renewables all use a lot of copper, and are set to grow for the foreseeable future.  
For example, an EV uses at least 2x more copper than a gas powered car.  
There also isn't a clear replacement for copper in these products, meaning the price can continue to rise without destroying demand.  
Aluminum is the most likely potential replacement, but not nearly as efficient (it would require a much higher volume of aluminum to do the same job).  
**Supply will not keep up**  
Supply is expected to fall well short of demand in the 2nd half of this decade.  
Ore grades are declining at many of the largest copper mines and there have been almost no major new discoveries in recent years.  
New copper mines can take 10 years to get up to full production, so they would not contribute to the supply equation until 2033.  
**TL;DR:** the world is going to need a lot of copper, there is no viable substitute, and the supply wont be there.  
**Disclosure:** I am long COPX, FCX, IVPAF and IE, though these do not constitute a large % of my portfolio yet.  
What are your thoughts? Am I missing anything? The most likely threat to the thesis above as far as I can see would be a breakthrough in extraction technology that dramatically increases supply.

&lt;strong&gt;Disclosure:&lt;/strong&gt; I am long COPX, FCX, IVPAF and IE, though these do not constitute a large % of my portfolio yet.&lt;br/&gt;
What are your thoughts? Am I missing anything? The most likely threat to the thesis above as far as I can see would be a breakthrough in extraction technology that dramatically increases supply.&lt;br/&gt;

I have AMZN stocks purchased more than a year ago at 100k$ and are now worth 150k$

I have ARKK stocks purchased more than a year ago at 20k$ and are now worth 5k$

Is this the right math?

AMZN Capital Gain = 50k
ARKK Capital loss = 15k

Therefore I need to sell 15k of ARKK (all my ARKK stocks) and enough AMZN stocks that have gains totaling 12k. This way I save on paying taxes on 12k of AMZN and I reduce my taxable income by 3k. Is this correct?

Sankyo has cash and cash equivalents of 1.9 Billion Dollars and almost no debt which results in 32,7$ Cash per share.

I calculated an approximately Asset Value of 2,098 Billion Dollar which results in 36,13$ per share.

The company has a high profitmargin of 30% which speaks for its strong marketposition.
I only know about one competing company which is Fujishoji Ltd a way smaller buisness in the same segment but with smaller profitmargin and decreasing revenue while the revenue of Sankyo is increasing strongly.

They both only earn money in Japan selling panchikos but it looks like sankyo establishing a Monopoly by gaining more and more marketshare.

Also the Cashflow is increasing very strongly. I calculated an average FCF-growth rate of 35,5% over the last 7 years and used a Discountrate of 15% which seems very conservative and calculated an intrinsic value of approximately 120$ per share.

In conclusion for me it seems like Sankyo is very strong buisness with an almost perfect balancesheet. It is increasing its revenue and free Cashflow constantly and has a high profitmargin and ROIC it is also paying a reliable dividend of 2.7%.
I know that in times of digitalisation the use of non-digital games will decrease but panchiko is a cult game which can be found in almost every japanese street. Because of the fact that this segment is decreasing I think that the probability of new entrants is very small which makes it easier to establish a Monopoly for Sankyo.

&lt;p&gt;Once Mutual funds came out IN THE 80&amp;#39;S  (which of course IS the stock market.) boomers and gen xers have been chucking their $$$ into that.  Teens today speculate on their phones with Robinhood with little fear of losing $$$  Nobody really seems afraid to invest in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandpa (92) and his friends are/were TERRIFIED of the stock market. Nobody older than the baby boomers would put their $$$ anywhere near that thing. They were even a bit afraid of banks.   They would buy real estate or even freezers full of fish and drums of heating oil, cans of food but never stocks.  I&amp;#39;m guessing this is why the stock market valuations blew up more than anything else in the last 40 years. People now have less fear of the markets and they need SOMEWHERE to invest. &lt;/p&gt;

367,investing,"[VGSH](https://digital.fidelity.com/prgw/digital/research/quote/dashboard/summary?symbol=VGSH) (VANGUARD SHORT TERM TREASURY ETF) has a 30-day **SEC yield of 4.98%** as of July 1 2023. However the distribution on July 5 was $0.1586 per share, for a trailing month **distribution yield of 3.25%** (= $0.1586 / $57.48 \* 365 / 34, it had been 34 days since the previous distribution).

I know the goal of SEC yield is to help compare across bond funds given varying distribution schedules, but how can it be a useful metric when it is so disconnected from the actual returns?

I have learned that the SEC yield is more like the YTM, which assumes the bonds are held to maturity. How does that result in the lower distribution yields we're seeing?

Imagine a bond fund that holds only one bond at a time. While the bond is held, the distribution yield will only consist of coupon payments, but the SEC yield is factoring in the eventual return of principal, so the SEC yield will be higher (assuming the bond was purchased at a discount). But when the bond is traded, its advancement toward maturity should be factored into the sale price and then that appreciation should be part of the next distribution, therefore over time the average distribution yield and SEC yield should match. Is this right? So at some point in the future we should start to see distribution yields become higher than SEC yields, that way the averages will work out to be similar?

The alternatives of using long term treasury bills and long term CDs is suboptimal I think because Ibonds are guaranteed to meet inflation (say 2.5% historically) and EE bonds if held 20 years the same (3.5% interest) and I expect low interest rates going forward due to government debt (they need inflation and low interest rates to keep low government debt).

I have Acorns and Betterment accounts that I am looking consolidate to another brokerage. These are both taxable accounts. I want to pick my funds and not pay the fees they charge. I have two questions.  

1. What kind of account should I open and where? Are there places where there is a good sign up bonus? I want access to the Fidelity and Vanguard index funds.

Do I do an IRA or traditional brokerage or something else?

# Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters

5-6 minutes  
2023-08-08  
Toby Nangle   
The writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager  
This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&amp;P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.  
With such a high proportion of a market’s value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.  
Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market’s stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.  
Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.  
In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.  
Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits — even after taking into account dividends.  
Bessembinder’s work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers — with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.  
Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies — even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region’s equity index can be something of a dark art.  
Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L’Oréal collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.  
If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It’s easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&amp;P 500 rally — Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta — might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market’s valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It’s hard to take a view on companies that don’t yet exist.  
I’ve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.  
But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets — or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known — have such a lousy record.  
The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder’s research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.

This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&amp;amp;P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.&lt;br/&gt;
With such a high proportion of a market’s value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.&lt;br/&gt;
Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market’s stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.&lt;br/&gt;
Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.&lt;br/&gt;
In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.&lt;br/&gt;
Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits — even after taking into account dividends.&lt;br/&gt;
Bessembinder’s work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers — with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.&lt;br/&gt;
Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies — even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region’s equity index can be something of a dark art.&lt;br/&gt;
Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L’Oréal collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.&lt;br/&gt;
If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It’s easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&amp;amp;P 500 rally — Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta — might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market’s valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It’s hard to take a view on companies that don’t yet exist.&lt;br/&gt;
I’ve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.&lt;br/&gt;
But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets — or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known — have such a lousy record.&lt;br/&gt;
The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder’s research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

394,investing,"This is a question about managing active trading to best deal with large losses for tax benefit.  

Say I bought shares in 10 companies 2 years ago, say for $100,000, and these all tanked, and the positions sank to $30,000, but have since bounced and are now worth $60,000 (net $40,000 loss).   Say I expect their prices to imminently resume sinking again, so I want to sell now at the bounce to salvage as much as possible.  

At the same time, I don't want to realize the $40,000 loss this year because I expect to have no realized gains to claim this year to offset that loss against, and would essentially ""lose"" the loss for tax benefit purposes and be stuck only able to use $3k/yr of it against ordinary income going forward (is that right?).  And in the next year, say I plan to sell other long term profitable positions for $50,000 of realized gain, then I would be taxed on all $50k of it, with no losses that year to offset it.  

So, I would rather save the net $40,000 in losses now for the future year when I sell other positions that have large gains.  So if I sell those 10 positions now at the market bounce, can I indefinitely push off claiming this $40,000 as a realized loss by making sure to actively buy and then immediately sell the same positions at least every 4 weeks, for a couple bucks profit or loss?  This way I more or less lock in the current ""bounce"" prices of the losing positions, but not the taxable loss. 

Since I assume the basis on each position would remain high, due to the wash sales, then every time I would quickly buy and sell, whether a couple pennies up or down, would count as a disallowed loss (carrying over against that original high basis), and so continue to drag out the wash sale and high original basis, until sometime next year when I want to sell the winners, then I can finally sell the losers and simply not repurchase, and finally claim the $40k in losses to offset the realized gains. 

Is this a viable strategy to time the tax offset of selling winning and losing positions?  Is there an easier and less annoying way to do this same thing?

My shock and disappointment is in a nuance that was never mentioned amongst friends, most forums, and lots of finance books. 

So, my situation models after a typical decent American household and would be considered extra good for rest of the world. 

I’m 32 with a Household income after taxes of 60,000$

Set aside 20% every month into a IRA &amp; Roth = 12,000/year

I plug that into a compounding calculator for 30 years with an average return of 9% (roughly a 50-100 year historical average) 

= boom 1,700,000$ 

I am rich!!!! Thank god I didn’t buy those Starbucks coffees everyday and invested it instead. 

But wait…. What’s guarantee in life: death, taxes, and inflation. 

1.7m in 30 years will not actually be 1.7m dollars today. 

Even worse, inflation compounds just as my interest on investments does. 

So an inflation calculator shows in 30 years “ This is an average inflation rate of -2.50% and cumulative inflation of -52.33%.” 

Meaning my 1.7m is actually 850,000$ when adjusted for inflation. 

Then 4% is a safe withdrawal rate of the 850k (inflation adjusted) = 34,000$ (and there will be a ~5% effective federal tax rate as married on the IRA withdrawal at least)

So my 20% saving rate(1k/m), with great 9% average returns, over 30 years with a tax deferred IRA/Roth account will result in ~2700$/m when adjusted for inflation. (Roughly half of my net income)

Now this isn’t bad, and paired with US social security, it is realistic 70-90% of my net income will be maintained in retirement. Great!

402,investing,"Instead of trying to come up with prompts to find stocks myself (only losers come up with ideas on their own).

  
I just asked ChatGPT to give me prompts to find stocks with potential.

  
I asked it to give me a quick explanation behind each prompt too.

  
The results were pretty interesting.

  
Note: You’ll need ChatGPT Plus and have the Boolio Invest plugin enabled for these to work.

  
It took a lot of trial and error for it to come up with good prompts. Some of the prompts it came up with were cool e.g. ""Find companies with a market capitalization under $5 billion that have expanded into new geographical markets in the last 2 years."" but there was no way for ChatGPT to actually find the answer.

  
Here are the best prompts it came up with (that worked for me)

**Prompt 1**  
Prompt: ""Find stocks with a P/S ratio below the industry average, positive net income, and a dividend yield of over 2%.""  
How it works: This prompt focuses on commonly available financial metrics like P/S ratio, net income, and dividend yield, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of potential value stocks.

**Prompt 2**

Prompt: ""Search for stocks with a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio below the sector median, a positive net income for the past 3 years, and a dividend yield above 3%.""  
How it works: A P/E ratio below the sector median can indicate undervaluation. Consistent net income shows profitability, and a decent dividend yield provides income, making it a comprehensive approach to find potential value stocks.

**Prompt 3**  
Prompt: ""Search for technology stocks with a 3-year revenue growth rate above 10%.""  
How it works: This prompt targets the technology sector and focuses on revenue growth, a key indicator of potential high growth.

**Prompt 4**  
Prompt: ""Find companies with a market capitalization under $2 billion that have increased their market share in the last year.""  
How it works: This prompt looks for companies that are still small but are growing.

**Prompt 5**  
Prompt: ""List healthcare stocks with an R&amp;D expense growth of over 5% in the last year.""  
How it works: Focusing on R&amp;D expense growth in the healthcare sector can uncover innovative companies.

**Prompt 6**  
Prompt: ""Identify stocks with a consistent track record of meeting or beating earnings estimates over the last 4 quarters and a P/B ratio below the industry average.""  
How it works: Earnings estimates and P/B ratio are widely used in financial analysis. This prompt combines these factors to find stocks that may be undervalued and have strong operational performance.

**Prompt 7**  
Prompt: ""List stocks that are trading at least 20% below their 52-week high and have a Return on Equity (ROE) above the industry average.""  
How it works: Stocks trading significantly below their 52-week high may be temporarily undervalued. A higher-than-average ROE indicates that the company is generating good returns on shareholders' equity, suggesting strong management.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to come up with prompts to find stocks myself (only losers come up with ideas on their own).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just asked ChatGPT to give me prompts to find stocks with potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked it to give me a quick explanation behind each prompt too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results were pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: You’ll need ChatGPT Plus and have the Boolio Invest plugin enabled for these to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a lot of trial and error for it to come up with good prompts. Some of the prompts it came up with were cool e.g. &amp;quot;Find companies with a market capitalization under $5 billion that have expanded into new geographical markets in the last 2 years.&amp;quot; but there was no way for ChatGPT to actually find the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the best prompts it came up with (that worked for me)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Prompt: &amp;quot;Find stocks with a P/S ratio below the industry average, positive net income, and a dividend yield of over 2%.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;
How it works: This prompt focuses on commonly available financial metrics like P/S ratio, net income, and dividend yield, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of potential value stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prompt: &amp;quot;Search for stocks with a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio below the sector median, a positive net income for the past 3 years, and a dividend yield above 3%.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;
How it works: A P/E ratio below the sector median can indicate undervaluation. Consistent net income shows profitability, and a decent dividend yield provides income, making it a comprehensive approach to find potential value stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Prompt: &amp;quot;Search for technology stocks with a 3-year revenue growth rate above 10%.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;
How it works: This prompt targets the technology sector and focuses on revenue growth, a key indicator of potential high growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Prompt: &amp;quot;Find companies with a market capitalization under $2 billion that have increased their market share in the last year.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;
How it works: This prompt looks for companies that are still small but are growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Prompt: &amp;quot;List healthcare stocks with an R&amp;amp;D expense growth of over 5% in the last year.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;
How it works: Focusing on R&amp;amp;D expense growth in the healthcare sector can uncover innovative companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Prompt: &amp;quot;Identify stocks with a consistent track record of meeting or beating earnings estimates over the last 4 quarters and a P/B ratio below the industry average.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;
How it works: Earnings estimates and P/B ratio are widely used in financial analysis. This prompt combines these factors to find stocks that may be undervalued and have strong operational performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Prompt: &amp;quot;List stocks that are trading at least 20% below their 52-week high and have a Return on Equity (ROE) above the industry average.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;
How it works: Stocks trading significantly below their 52-week high may be temporarily undervalued. A higher-than-average ROE indicates that the company is generating good returns on shareholders&amp;#39; equity, suggesting strong management.&lt;/p&gt;

Been a lurker on this sub for a while and really have gained so much insight from all of you on my investing journey, so shout out to you guys!

I am 27 and have a generally pretty boring portfolio with splits as follows:

1) VOO - 45%

2) VT - 40%

3) Individual stocks - 10% (lot of EV stocks since i have passion for them (especially rivian), as well as holdovers like GE, amazon, disney from investing prior to committing everything to ETFs)

4) DRIV - 5% (again, electric car nut, know its redundant, but nice to have a lot of the EV market outside of RIVN in an ETF, even if it is pretty top heavy with Google, etc.)

Know the overlap between VOO and VT, but when I started investing in ETFs, I was exclusively buying VOO. As I learned more, found out that I liked some exposure to international and small caps, but not enough to VT and chill lol. 

Recently, I have been having a strong desire to be more aggressive. I dont know if I am just falling into the trap of wanting to stray from ""boring"" investing, and end up shooting myself in the foot. 

Would love to hear from you all if I should just maintain a holding pattern, or if I am missing something important in my portfolio for somebody my age who is actually pretty risk tolerant? Appreciate you all!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, &lt;/p&gt;

""The U.S. Federal Reserve will likely need to raise interest rates further to bring down inflation, Governor Michelle Bowman said on Saturday.

Bowman said she supported the Fed's quarter-point increase in interest rates last month, given still-high inflation, strong consumer spending, a rebound in the housing market and a labor market that is helping to feed higher prices.

""I also expect that additional rate increases will likely be needed to get inflation on a path down to the FOMC’s 2 percent target,"" she said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Kansas Bankers Association, referring to the Fed's rate-setting panel, the Federal Open Market Committee.""

Data from last Friday also seems to underpin this:

Metric	Actual	(Estimate) :

* Unemployment rate: **3.5%**	 (3.6%)
* Average hourly earnings (MoM): **+0.4%**	(+0.3%)

So unemployment dropped back to 3.5% and wage growth added 0.4% which was above estimate. Keep in mind that Powell and the Fed pay alot of attention to those 2 specific metrics.

Also [Fed's own Nowcasting](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting) projects CPI +0.4% for the month of July (which is above the current estimate of 0.2%) and even **+0,6% for the month of August.**

Even with some margin of error those are both **way above 2% on annual basis** which would require on average inflation not be more than +0,17% so both July and August readings would be high above that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-bowman-says-more-us-rate-hikes-likely-will-be-needed-2023-08-05/""&gt;https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-bowman-says-more-us-rate-hikes-likely-will-be-needed-2023-08-05/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I think with a combination of stock, bond, and REITs, it’s not so difficult to get 10% yearly with max drawdown bellows 50%.

Portfolio will be something like these, (with symbols and yearly returns)

20% REITs: O 6% 

20% BDC: ARCC 10%

40% Stock: QQQ 15%, SPY 12%

20% Bond: I haven’t really looked into which bond to buy, but probably treasury with cooperation bonds around 5%-8%

It’s just a rough idea to show it seems possible and the ratio can be changed. Do you guys think it feasible? That means 30k yearly cost. 2.5 k monthly cost (including rent and everything). 

p.s Assuming one person only. I may accidentally get a family but I don’t want to make this estimation too complicated.

High exposure to HML, RMW and CMA. Negative momentum but I think that's expected from an index that is value-tilted.

**The index is market cap weighted and I'm wondering what would be the implications on factor exposure if I equal weight it.**

Equal weighting would give more weight the smaller stocks so SMB should increase.

However what about the other factors? I compared **MSCI World** with **MSCI World Equal Weighted** and SMB and HML increased, while WML dropped.

Should I expect similar results here? I'm wondering because even though the index is market cap weighted, several screens have already been applied to it (the high dividend screens).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using my broker&amp;#39;s Pie feature I&amp;#39;m looking into manually replicating the &lt;a href=""https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/a2dc8d4b-d506-4d5d-8fc6-78eb37096df6""&gt;MSCI Japan High Dividend Yield&lt;/a&gt; index.

By Noah Smith

I do not want to be a shill for the Biden administration. Yes, I like most of what Biden is doing on industrial policy. But I really want to resist being one of those center-left pundits who always just blasts out the latest press release of a Democratic administration and trumpets how many jobs the President has “created”. That sort of partisan cheerleading would be damaging to my credibility (or at least my self-respect) as an independent analyst of the economy, and it would also play into the kind of silly simplifications that the media too often uses to talk about the macroeconomy — for example, the idea that the President “creates jobs”, or is responsible for everything that happens to the economy under his watch.

And yet when I look at how the U.S. economy is doing right now, I find it difficult to describe it in terms that allow me to avoid sounding like a shill. I know lots of Americans still think the economy is doing poorly, and are upset about that. But when I look at objective measures, I just can’t rationalize that negative viewpoint. Because as far as I can tell from the actual numbers, this economy is doing really, really well.

Why the economy is doing really, really well

What do we want from the macroeconomy?

We want employment to be high, meaning that as many people as possible who want jobs can get them.

We want inflation to be low, so that people have certainty about how far their paycheck and their savings will go in the future.

We want real incomes to rise, meaning that we’re able to consume more than we could in the past, or save more if we want to.

(There’s a fourth thing we might want, which is wealth, but that’s more complicated and I’ll talk about it later.)

Basically, this is the whole list. If people have jobs, inflation is low, and real incomes are rising, the economy is good. That doesn’t mean people necessarily realize it’s good — social strife, or partisan polarization, or lingering pessimism from past disasters may cause people to be pessimistic about the economy even in the face of great data, a phenomenon some refer to as a “vibecession”. But while I acknowledge that people’s feelings are important and that there are other things that matter besides the economy, when I’m analyzing how well the macroeconomy is actually performing, I can’t go on vibes.

And when we look at the objective numbers, they are great. First of all, there’s the employment situation. Some indicators of employment, like labor-force participation, look bad because we’re in the middle of the great Baby Boom retirement. That’s why you generally shouldn’t use measures of the labor force that don’t adjust for age! When we do adjust for age, we find that the U.S. job market is now the best that it’s been in recorded history. Here’s the employment rate — i.e. the percentage of Americans who have a job — adjusted for age:

https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab8bdbf8-7696-4c14-b516-f1babc5b19b8_791x533.jpeg

This shows what the employment rate would have been since 1981 if the fractions of the U.S. population in each age group were the same as in February 2020, right before the pandemic. Basically, we have a much older population today than we used to, and this is a way to try to take that into account. Now you can say “Well, if the labor market of 2023 were as good as 1999, then old people would be working a lot more in 2023 than they did back in 1999.” And maybe that’s true, but if so, there’s not really much way to tell. The assumption that aging works about the same in 2023 as it worked in 1999 seems like a good one. And even if the reality is a little bit off from that assumption, we’re still pretty damn near the best labor market ever.

Next up we have inflation. This has, of course, been the big problem since the start of 2021. But now inflation is plunging; if it’s not back to its target, it’s headed there very rapidly. In month-to-month terms, PCE inflation (which the Fed likes better than the more commonly used CPI) is now below the 2% target.

https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb08b3c8c-ac2a-417b-958b-3254f4efec64_1318x450.png

Slower-moving measures are all headed downward. Broader measures are falling rapidly as well. And when you include the rents that people are paying on new leases instead of rents for leases signed long ago, inflation looks even lower. Meanwhile, market inflation expectations, measured by the 5-year breakeven, increasingly look like they’ve been completely tamed, which means people think the Fed has inflation under control in the long term:

While the portfolio allocation propsed above has historically generated near or above stock market level performance while taking significantly less risk (which is a good thing), one of my concerns for your account is to reposition the assets to a more tax-efficient allocation.  One of the ways to achieve this is in a taxable account using ETF’s for stock-oriented investments as opposed to mutual funds.  Mutual funds are required to pay out to shareholders and capital gain distributions from mutual funds which result in a taxable event.  Over the past two years your  account has generated taxable capital gain distributions of $8,000- $10,000 annually.  ETFs and individual stocks do not have to follow the same tax rules that apply to mutual funds, and therefore instead of paying out capital gain distributions to shareholders, they take the gains generated by the sale of stocks and just purchase more stocks.  Since the capital gain distribution is not paid out to you the result is avoidance of taxation.    
 
The value of a couple stock oriented investments in your account have increased in value so if we were to sell the shares of those investments to rebalance  it would result in a capital gain of approximately $11,000± for 2023 taxes, but then going forward we no longer have those annual tax burdens.

Does the above sound ok? Or what should I be asking him?  I am trying to learn about investing instead of relying on Reddit but it’s a slow process so I appreciate this forum.

Mutual funds are required to pay out to shareholders and capital gain distributions from mutual funds which result in a taxable event.  Over the past two years your  account has generated taxable capital gain distributions of $8,000- $10,000 annually.  ETFs and individual stocks do not have to follow the same tax rules that apply to mutual funds, and therefore instead of paying out capital gain distributions to shareholders, they take the gains generated by the sale of stocks and just purchase more stocks.  Since the capital gain distribution is not paid out to you the result is avoidance of taxation.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of a couple stock oriented investments in your account have increased in value so if we were to sell the shares of those investments to rebalance  it would result in a capital gain of approximately $11,000± for 2023 taxes, but then going forward we no longer have those annual tax burdens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the above sound ok? Or what should I be asking him?  I am trying to learn about investing instead of relying on Reddit but it’s a slow process so I appreciate this forum.&lt;/p&gt;

She currently does not have much in the way of savings, is working, and has a house with a smallish mortgage (I do not know the balance owed).

My sister and I want to give her some monthly/yearly money going forward. She has balked a bit, but is finally coming around to the idea. I would love for part of it to be available now, and part later, likely potentially in the form of ROTH contributions or something of that nature.

481,investing,"Hi all,

After lurking for many years watching the markets make crazy returns, a few weeks back I put my life savings + an old 401k into ETF’s and a few individual stocks. $100k in the ind bene account and $47k in the rollover IRA. Current total value of $147,000. 

I wanted to sell a few days ago when my account was up $6700 and of course I didn’t and the recent dip has happened and has dropped to leave me barely in the green +$700. I know the timeline for investing is supposed to be 20+ years but I’ve been in the camp of everything is extremely overvalued and I don’t want to watch my money dip 30-40% in the short term. 

I’m 37.. my 401k and wife’s 403b are maxed yearly with another 170k in those accounts and I will never touch those no matter the dips in market. My thought has always been that these will be our true retirement accounts and the other money is just a big savings pot. 


So my question is… Do I… 

A. Just stay the course and leave all my money in the investments? And cry when a big dip happens. 

B. Pull the $100k out of Ind Bene account and tuck into safer HYSA to sit on sidelines another few months while collecting a boring 5%. (While leaving the $47k rollover invested into ETF’s)

C. Buy a property I’ve been looking at for $180k-$200k. Would require all my $100k + a $80k loan. 


I like the idea of the property because even if it dips short term, it’s still mine. It -should- also increase in value over time due to its location near a major city (Houston). BUT, I know by doing this I’m potentially leaving tons of money on the table by not staying with option A if markets continue their 6-10% average returns year after year. 


Ahh life has great decisions.

EDIT 2: When I say “no high risk”/“safely” that doesn’t mean I’m only open to low risk/no risk investing. I’m willing to look into mild to moderate risk investments I just don’t want to do high risk bc I don’t want to end up like the 95% of day traders that fail &amp; lose all their money. 

I’m a college student &amp; I’m looking to start investing to pay off my student loans. I took out a few smaller loans the first 3 years that total to about $17,000. I’m not worried about these bc I have money set aside to pay for them either lump sum or with in 2 years. 

However, I have to take out an additional $32,000 loan to pay for my final year by myself. I’m doing an internship right now and my total earnings r projected to be around $10,000 by the end if I continue putting 75% of my paycheck into my HYSA. I also have another couple of thousands in another savings account under my parents names. The loan I’m looking at right now would have me paying around $400 a month while in school so I would be left with around $5,000 in my main savings account by the time I graduate. I really don’t want to end up paying $10,000 in interest or have to be making payments for 10+ years so I’ve been researching ways I could invest the spare $5,000 now. I would be adding to it monthly somewhere between $200 - $400. 

I’ve been looking into ETFs &amp; mutual funds but to my understanding unless you’re investing large sums of money these investments don’t grow very fast. I don’t want to get into day trading/scalping or anything high risk bc I can’t really afford to lose money right now nor do I have the money to fund this type of investing. I know about CDs as well but from what I’ve seen they don’t make much at all. I get that I can use a compound investing strategy but are there any types of investing that are considered more middle of the road? Or types of investing strategies that are more aggressive?

My interest in finance only started a few days ago and obviously I don’t have the knowledge y’all have, that’s why I came here to ask a question. 

However, I’m sticking to my HYSA and adding monthly for now to reach my goal of paying off my loans fast. I’m also going to start buying t bills &amp; some CDs to get comfortable with the market, then move up to ETFs when I have a bit more saved up to throw around. Big thanks to anyone that was actually helpful.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: When I say fast I don’t mean overnight or even within a year. I mean I don’t want to wait 30 years. I’m thinking 5k to 10k within a year or two or 5k to 25k within 5 years - WHILE ALSO CONTRIBUTING MONTHLY TO THE ORIGINAL 5K - I’m aware I’m not using “proper” wording to explain what I mean, I’m new at this, please bear with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: When I say “no high risk”/“safely” that doesn’t mean I’m only open to low risk/no risk investing. I’m willing to look into mild to moderate risk investments I just don’t want to do high risk bc I don’t want to end up like the 95% of day traders that fail &amp;amp; lose all their money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a college student &amp;amp; I’m looking to start investing to pay off my student loans. I took out a few smaller loans the first 3 years that total to about $17,000. I’m not worried about these bc I have money set aside to pay for them either lump sum or with in 2 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I have to take out an additional $32,000 loan to pay for my final year by myself. I’m doing an internship right now and my total earnings r projected to be around $10,000 by the end if I continue putting 75% of my paycheck into my HYSA. I also have another couple of thousands in another savings account under my parents names. The loan I’m looking at right now would have me paying around $400 a month while in school so I would be left with around $5,000 in my main savings account by the time I graduate. I really don’t want to end up paying $10,000 in interest or have to be making payments for 10+ years so I’ve been researching ways I could invest the spare $5,000 now. I would be adding to it monthly somewhere between $200 - $400. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been looking into ETFs &amp;amp; mutual funds but to my understanding unless you’re investing large sums of money these investments don’t grow very fast. I don’t want to get into day trading/scalping or anything high risk bc I can’t really afford to lose money right now nor do I have the money to fund this type of investing. I know about CDs as well but from what I’ve seen they don’t make much at all. I get that I can use a compound investing strategy but are there any types of investing that are considered more middle of the road? Or types of investing strategies that are more aggressive?&lt;/p&gt;

You joined this sub to learn, give advise, &amp;amp; share information, not insult &amp;amp; shame people. My interest in finance only started a few days ago and obviously I don’t have the knowledge y’all have, that’s why I came here to ask a question. &lt;/p&gt;

*From Bailey Schulz USA Today 8/4/23*  
  
Which jobs are most at-risk due to AI?  
  
U.S. jobs likely to have *high, medium and low exposure* to AI include:  
  
**High exposure:**  
  
Budget analysts  
  
Data entry keyers  
  
Tax preparers  
  
Technical writers  
  
Web developers  
  
**Medium exposure:**  
  
Chief executives  
  
Veterinarians  
  
Interior designers  
  
Fundraisers  
  
Sales managers  
  
**Low exposure:**  
  
Barbers  
  
Child care workers  
  
Dishwashers  
  
Firefighters  
  
Pipelayers  
  
In sum, about 19% of U.S. workers were in jobs most exposed to AI last year, while an even greater share (23%) had jobs considered least exposed.    
  
It's not clear how many jobs will be displaced by AI. A March report from Goldman Sachs found AI could substitute up to 25% of current work, with about two-thirds of jobs exposed to ""some degree"" of automation.  
  
But researchers note that displacements following the emergence of new technology have typically been offset by the creation of new jobs, with census data suggesting that about 60% of workers today are employed in jobs that didn't exist in 1940.  
  
Which employees are most at risk?  
  
Pew found that women, Asian, college-educated and higher-paid workers are more exposed to AI.   
  
Kochhar said this is because of the types of jobs held by different demographics: men tend to hold more jobs requiring physical labor like construction, for instance.  
  
""So at the moment, they have less exposure to AI,"" Kochhar said. ""Which is not to say AI could not lead to smarter robots that can do it all, also. That's not something we looked into.""  
  
According to the report:  
  
Workers with a bachelor’s degree (27%) are more likely than those with only a high school diploma (12%) to hold a job with the most exposure to AI.  
  
Women (21%) are more likely than men (17%) to have jobs with the most exposure to AI.  
  
Black (15%) and Hispanic (13%) workers are less exposed than Asian (24%) and white (20%) workers.   
  
Workers in the most exposed jobs last year earned $33 per hour on average, while jobs with the least amount of exposure earned $20 per hour.  
  
Despite warnings from AI company executives that the technology will take away jobs, many workers – especially those with jobs considered highly exposed to AI – are optimistic about AI's impact.  
  
Thirty-two percent of information and technology workers ‒ who work in an industry that is considered more exposed to AI ‒ say the technology will help more than hurt them compared with 11% who believe the opposite.   
  
Meanwhile, 14% of workers in hospitality, services and arts – a “less exposed” industry – think AI will help more than hurt. A greater share (17%) believe it's more likely to hurt them.  
  
""Where AI has penetrated at the moment, workers are finding it being more useful than hurtful or businesses are applying in what that is benefiting workers as opposed to replacing workers,"" Kochhar said.  
  
Overall, 16% of U.S. adults said they think AI will help more than hurt, while 15% said they thought it would hurt more than help. Thirty percent say it will help and hurt equally, and 32% said they were unsure.

493,investing,"Long post, but if you like options and making money you may find it interesting.

I've got about a $500k portolfio I'm playing with. I've had my fun gambling with options over the last 5 or 6 years, understand the concepts and general strategies, but now want to ""settle down"" and try to maximize my return with a more boring strategy. I've put a good bit of thought into it and started executing some over the last 6 months, want to lay out what I'm thinking, and see if anyone has any critiques or comments, basically see if it's as good of an idea as I think it is. For reference, about half of my portfolio is in the general ETFs (SPY, QQQ, etc), the other half in individual stocks that I like for one reason or the other.

So far I haven't really sold any covered calls on the ETFs because the premium hasn't been attractive enough. They aren't volatile enough. Feels like picking up pennies in front of a steam roller. But I have strongly considered starting to, and just rolling over indefinitely if needed. Will come back to this later in the post.

What I have been doing is waiting until some of my individual stock picks are near what I think of as near term ""peaks"" and selling covered calls on them about 10-20% OTM about 45 days out. I don't expect to get assigned, but when it's close to expiration and I would be assigned because they have turned ITM, I have just been rolling them over. I haven't been selling covered calls on stocks in my portfolio that I think are in a low point in their mid-term cycle because I don't want to limit their upside.

More on the rollovers. For example, I bought SCHW at $52, sold call on it with a $60 strike, jumped to $67 at earnings. Bought to close my call at $60, sold to open another at $62.5 with an expiry 2.5 months later for the same price per contract I bought to close my $60 call. Doing this I'm essentially making $250 for waiting 2.5 months if SCHW price stays elevated. With SCHW in particular I think I calculated that even if it goes up to $100 per share, I'm still making like 12% per year just on the rollovers not counting the initial 15% gain from 52-60, it will eventually catch up, and I'm protected from a lot of downside risk unless it just plummets because I'm holding deep ITM calls. Seems like a win-win-win?

Now the above returns are because SCHW is relatively volatile. I sold covered calls on AMZN this morning after the earnings spike because the math is similar. Back to the ETFS... I almost sold covered calls on SPY this morning too, but did the math and my rollovers look like they would only gain 5% a year, instead of the 12%+ on AMZN and SCHW. Not to mention I have to sell the initial call much closer to the money to be worth anything signficant. With a spike in the S&amp;P I could see myself being ""underwater"" and having to rollover for years limited to the sub-par 5% gains and missing out on the broader market movement.

Soo... investors that are smarter than me, does all this make sense? Is the strategy sound or am I missing something? It's probably just a typical covered call strategy, but I don't see it being talked about very much.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long post, but if you like options and making money you may find it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

When it comes to investing for my retirement that is 30 years away, do you think Climate change will cause a serious impact on say the S&amp;P500 vs historical averages? 

On one hand, I’m worried returns will plummet as the economy struggles with the destruction of climate change. 

On the other hand, businesses should continue to find and make profits as they have through all previous disasters this past century.

I currently live in a 3 bed 2 bath house close to town. House is worth about 300k, and I owe 66k on it at 3.5% (bought in 2014 as a forclosure and fixed up ourselves). My family is growing so I'm considering buying a new house for about 500k. With interest rates what they are, the new mortgage is larger than I'd like at about 3400 including taxes (with 20% cash being put down). 

I want to keep the existing home as a long term rental. The mortgage payment on it is about $760 per month and comparable homes rent for $1800-2000 here. 

Although I make a good salary, I'm a bit uncomfortable with the risk involved in carrying a $400k mortgage (at 7%) on the new house plus a $66k mortgage in the rental. I am considering pulling my money out of my Roth and my wife's Roth to pay off the mortgage on the rental as the combined balance of those is about what we owe on the ""rental"". Our return from the Roths has been about 8.2% over the past couple years. 

I know this generally frowned upon, but paying this off would mean I have a $300,000 property generating about $1900 in cash flow each month with no debt service. And my risk would be substantially lower. My other option is to squeek by on my monthly expenses and let the mortgage be paid down over time. 

For reference, the Roths are 100% in VTSAX and I am 34 years old. I also have a 401k at work, so these are not my only retirement funds.

Goal is for a quick overview of the earnings report for an average person to be able to read and digest\*\*

1. Operating Activities:  
The operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showcases how Amazon generates cash from its core business operations. In both periods, the company's operating activities generated positive cash flow. There was a significant increase in net income, showing growth from a loss of $2.03 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. This highlights a remarkable improvement in Amazon's financial performance and operational efficiency.  
  
2. Investing Activities:  
Amazon invested heavily in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions during the analyzed periods. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, the company's investments in property and equipment amounted to $15.72 billion, which decreased to $11.45 billion in the same period in 2023. While the absolute values decreased, these investments are essential for the company's long-term growth and expansion.  
  
3. Financing Activities:  
The financing activities section details Amazon's capital structure and shareholder returns. The company engaged in various financing activities, including repurchasing common stock, resulting in cash outflows of $3.33 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2023, and $6 billion in the six months ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, the company obtained proceeds from short-term debt and other financing, contributing $4.87 billion and $4.4 billion in the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Investors should be aware of these activities, as they impact the company's capital allocation strategy.  
  
4. Cash Position:  
Amazon maintained a strong cash position, reflecting its financial stability and liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased steadily over the periods, reaching $50.07 billion at the end of the twelve months ending June 30, 2023. This signifies the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and pursue growth opportunities.  
  
5. Debt and Interest Payments:  
The company managed its debt obligations efficiently, making principal repayments on long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations. Amazon also paid interest on debt, with cash outflows totaling $349 million and $954 million for the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. These payments demonstrate responsible debt management and the company's commitment to meeting its financial obligations.

Lumen Technologies, Inc. experienced mixed results in Q2 2023. Positive highlights include significant improvement in Business Grow product revenue and accelerated Quantum Fiber-enabled location pacing. However, they reported a substantial net loss of $8.736 billion, including a non-cash goodwill impairment charge, compared to a net income of $344 million in Q2 2022. Negative trends include decreased Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as negative Free Cash Flow, raising concerns about their financial performance. Considerations include the impact of divestitures, reliance on non-GAAP metrics, speculative forward-looking statements, and the varying DCF price value estimates.

Goal is to produce fairly easy to read overview on earnings reports for average persons to digest and highlight the more important information found**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lumen Technologies, Inc. experienced both positive and negative developments in the second quarter of 2023:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positive highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;• They increased their Business Grow product revenue from the previous quarter, showing significant improvement compared to the second quarter of 2022, considering the impact of divested businesses.
• They accelerated their Quantum Fiber-enabled location pacing, deploying a considerable number of fiber locations during the same period.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negative highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;• They reported a Net Loss of $8.736 billion for the second quarter of 2023, which includes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $8.793 billion. This loss is significant compared to the reported Net Income of $344 million in the second quarter of 2022.
• Their Diluted EPS for the second quarter of 2023 showed a loss of ($8.88) per share, compared to earnings of $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding Special Items, the Diluted EPS for the second quarter of 2023 was $0.10 per share, lower than the $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2022.
• Their Adjusted EBITDA decreased from $1.811 billion in the second quarter of 2022 to $1.229 billion in the second quarter of 2023, excluding the effects of Special Items.
• They reported Net Cash Used in Operating Activities of $(100) million for the second quarter of 2023, and generated negative Free Cash Flow of $(896) million compared to positive $668 million in the second quarter of 2022.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges, the company’s CEO, Kate Johnson, mentioned progress in their growth strategy and revenue performance in their next-generation growth products.

TL;DR Does having more investors than ever before and faster opportunities for companies to grow account for the “outrageous multiples” we see?

I believe the average PE of the S&amp;P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don’t need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

With that in mind, I can’t help but think about the amount of new money that’s been brought in in the last 20 years as ease of access to investing, as well as financial savvy has grown. I mean look at the market cap of the US market here:

https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

Are we just in a new norm as a result of these things? I’m not saying the market isn’t overvalued but is it AS overvalued as analysts think or should we be adjusting our baselines?

But as I've started to accumulate more money in a market index fund I have been wondering if keeping any money in a money market account makes sense so long as you have enough extra in stocks. The worst that can happen is that the market goes down right when I need the emergency fund, which could certainly happen together in an economic downturn. In that case I'd essentially be paying more for using the emergency fund.

Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I'd basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. 

So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.

Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I'm not considering?

&gt;**He has the power to wipe out the entire human race. If we believe there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.**

In financial planning, this is truer than ever. So many ""30-year"" projections all make massive assumptions. That 6-months of emergency funds will be enough. That interest rates on bonds will be ""safe"" (not anymore they're not). That real-estate will appreciate. That social security will be there for you. That the government won't default etc etc.

Often, people glibly dismiss worse-case scenarios saying *""Well, if that happens, you'll have bigger things to worry about""*. No, I fucking won't! The government can default, but my first concern will be protecting my finances.

So what am I preparing for? **I don't know.** I have no idea what to prepare for.

What is my long-term horizon? I don't know

When will I retire? **I don't know**

For how long will I live? **I don't know**

How much money will I need? **I don't know**

I have no idea what will go wrong, or when.

So I thought I'll share six things I do to prepare for the worst.

**Keep $200k in Cash Equivalents**

People often recommend a ""6-month"" emergency fund. As if life's major problems will only last 6-months. What if you get disabled? What if your entire job industry vanishes, and you're unemployed for six years?

So I keep a 75/25 stock/cash portfolio allocation.

More importantly, I can't even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.

**Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only**

I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I'll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.

Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it's not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.

Always assume that you're going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.

**A Strong Value Tilt**

In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post [in defense of dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/), so I won't rehash my arguments here. I'll add only this - dividends aren't enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.

In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the [Gordon equation](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808).

**Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me**

If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don't want complications at the worst possible time.

**Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife**

A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I [posted about it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/) :) . It's not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.

But in case I'm persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can *maybe* bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.

**No House - Rent Only**

A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don't know what kind of tenants you'll get. Too much risk.

Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.

Bottom line: Always assume that everything will fall apart. If it doesn't, it's a pleasant surprise. But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a quote in Batman v Superman, where Bruce Wayne tells Alfred this about Superman:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Strong Value Tilt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/""&gt;in defense of dividends&lt;/a&gt;, so I won&amp;#39;t rehash my arguments here. I&amp;#39;ll add only this - dividends aren&amp;#39;t enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the &lt;a href=""https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808""&gt;Gordon equation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don&amp;#39;t want complications at the worst possible time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/""&gt;posted about it on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; :) . It&amp;#39;s not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in case I&amp;#39;m persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No House - Rent Only&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don&amp;#39;t know what kind of tenants you&amp;#39;ll get. Too much risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Always assume that everything will fall apart. If it doesn&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s a pleasant surprise. But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.&lt;/p&gt;

545,investing,"Hi all,

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&amp;#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|120|5|25|
|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.

After doing some research, I am considering investing in a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. However, I have some questions and would love to hear your thoughts and advice:

	1.	Is now a good time to step into the market, given the current economic conditions and market trends?
	2.	Considering my age and long-term investment horizon, does investing in a 2x leveraged ETF make sense, or are there other investment strategies I should consider?
	3.	Should I go 100% in on the S&amp;P 500 2x leverage ETF, or would a diversified portfolio be a better approach?

I will use the commodity NATGAS as an example which is $2.69 (01-aug.-'23) and I use Etoro as platform.  
However, the question is a general question for all platforms I suppose:  
  
I see that if eg. today I open a short (CFD, 1x) of $1000,- I get a weekly fee of $10.49 indefinitely as long as my position does not hit stop loss.  
I can move my stop loss to $14.8 if I add another $4000,- to my position.  
So using $5000 in total, I get $10.49\*52=$545 annually. This is more than 10%!!  
  
Now, I get that if the price of NATGAS rises, I am in ''trouble'', but not as long as it stays under my SL. I could even put the fees I receive back into my position increasing the SL further over time whilst maintaining the $545 annual fee.  
If I look at the history of NATGAS (known for more than 25 years) it never reached $15,-  
  
I know that results from the past are no guarantees for the future but still it feels like a solid way to get $545 annually! Why isn't everyone doing this then...

&lt;p&gt;However, the question is a general question for all platforms I suppose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see that if eg. today I open a short (CFD, 1x) of $1000,- I get a weekly fee of $10.49 indefinitely as long as my position does not hit stop loss.&lt;/p&gt;

Interested to see if there is any research out there that could suggest active trading beats B&amp;H. 

I've done some small backtesting on a few hundred trades that I thought I had identified as non-random movements, and even still the win % only really comes out to about 54% with a 1:1 Risk reward ratio. 

Theoretically, that has positive expected value, however, due to randomness, and the win % not being high enough, you are basically jsut chopping around and maybe making a few % points here and there on the most likely run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Again, this was just some small testing I personally did but everything in my view doesn't really hold up to simple B&amp;H over the long run. 

With that being said, I was interested in seeing if there is research out there comparing buy and hold to active management / active trading over a large enough data set and if there is potentially above what you would normally get by just buying a Vanguard index fund. 

Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it's because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I've made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same. You are basically around break even, + or - a few % points over enough trade samples.

Currently, I have a Roth IRA, and Simple IRA and a brokerage account through fidelity. I max out my IRAs and contribute leftover money monthly into my fidelity account. 

Emergency cash is parked in a HYSA and set for 6 months. 

Last night I took my current balances and compounded them at 8% for the next 25 years. I only gave the Roth IRA max contribution at the current limit, everything else I just let compound. 

I came out with a 1.7mil portfolio. Of course with taxes and what not that number will be a bit less.

In addition my wife is a government employee with a great retirement plan. 

Here is my dilemma…

I feel that I am “behind” and not putting enough away. Because of this I feel that I need to pour extra money monthly into my fidelity account. Sometimes stressing me out that I don’t “make” enough even though I can cover all of our bills and have money for hobbies, vacation, entertainment, etc.

I am not sure where this comes from and/or how to get in the right mindset with it.  

1.7mil will definitely not be enough to live off, but even with just investing in my Simple IRA and Roth I feel that the fidelity account is an added bonus and wondering if it’s work it versus living and enjoying the moment with that extra cash flow.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am 38 and am struggling to feel comfortable with my portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;

I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I'm normally an index funds kinda guy. 

My research suggests there are a few things I can do:

**Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.**

Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: 

* limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. 
* pay taxes -&gt; less to reinvest. 


**Buy protective puts**

Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren't free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. 

**Set a trailing stop loss**
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it's easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. 

So my questions are: are there other options I didn't consider?  Which of these is best if I am long term bullish on these stocks?

&lt;p&gt;I am not a very risky person and not looking to make millions off of the money just looking for an even flow. I could pay for my home and still keep the 300k. &lt;/p&gt;

Edit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

Edit: For those of you reaching out, worried about me being attacked here, don't worry. I'm 41 years and a grown ass adult. Words won't hurt me :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start with, I&amp;#39;m 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22. Right now, my portfolio is just around a million dollars - still waiting to get a $87k tax refund from the government. Here&amp;#39;s a screenshot of my portfolio:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: The portfolio total is in Canadian dollars. So convert US holdings like SCHD, VOO, IBTG etc from USD to CAD, and the total should add up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: You&amp;#39;ll see that I&amp;#39;m not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I&amp;#39;m not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about &amp;quot;young&amp;quot; investors chasing dividends: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;m not exactly old, I&amp;#39;m not exactly young either. And here&amp;#39;s why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Arguments for Dividends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No investor thinks that dividends are &amp;quot;free money&amp;quot;. Obviously money doesn&amp;#39;t grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a &amp;quot;gotcha&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company&amp;#39;s assets. So let&amp;#39;s get that out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a fundamental level, I don&amp;#39;t care about stock prices. I care about only two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) What is my income stream?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) How fast is that income stream growing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person&amp;#39;s wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here&amp;#39;s a quote from Great Expectations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book &amp;quot;The Four Pillars of Investing&amp;quot;, Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I don&amp;#39;t care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you&amp;#39;re poor. At least for me. Doesn&amp;#39;t matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Dividends ARE From a Company&amp;#39;s Earnings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don&amp;#39;t use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn&amp;#39;t hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the big one. The theory goes that companies that don&amp;#39;t pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn&amp;#39;t want that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. &lt;strong&gt;That money was yours&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#39;s human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a company to retain dividends, they need to &lt;em&gt;generate a higher return than their own current cashflow&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they&amp;#39;re promising that they&amp;#39;ll get even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that&amp;#39;s your gamble to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you re-invest your dividends, you&amp;#39;re purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven &lt;strong&gt;they can already generate&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#39;s not pie-in-the-sky &amp;quot;trust me bro&amp;quot; cashflow. You know the company&amp;#39;s track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You&amp;#39;re buying more of the same. It&amp;#39;s more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English used to have a saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It&amp;#39;s stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. When a Company Fails, All You&amp;#39;re Left with is Dividends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it&amp;#39;s in distress and that shareholders won&amp;#39;t get the value of the company&amp;#39;s assets, so that&amp;#39;s a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Microsoft&amp;#39;s yield is low. But it&amp;#39;s growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one denies that companies need to retain &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company&amp;#39;s cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my strategy, and I&amp;#39;m sticking to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: For those of you reaching out, worried about me being attacked here, don&amp;#39;t worry. I&amp;#39;m 41 years and a grown ass adult. Words won&amp;#39;t hurt me :)&lt;/p&gt;

3. Paying a dividend is often a sign that the company is financially healthy.  This is why it's a taxable event; there's actual cash flow.

I don't tend to buy individual stocks; and happened to pick Apple like 10 years ago with all my yearly contribution money, and that paid off, but that's not a strategy or something I will be likely to do again. I feel like maybe my account lacks focus; do I dump stuff like target date funds and disciplined equity and just go FXAIX, FNXMC, JEPI? 

I'm not trying to get crazy and beat the market; but I do realize I am lagging the market and want to get closer to market average returns; I do like JEPI for the dividend paying monthly in a tax advantaged account. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;37M; I&amp;#39;ve had my Roth IRA for many years but didn&amp;#39;t starting maxing it out every years until about 10 years ago.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I own 208.xx shared of AAPL (at $28.83) and so the monster return I&amp;#39;ve had on that over the years definitely inflates the overall portfolio value. &lt;/p&gt;

629,investing,"I think dividend stocks are fundamentally misunderstood by the majority of investors. I (hopefully) imagine most people in r/investing already know dividend mechanics, but I often see a few common arguments on personal finance forums for dividend stocks.  


**(1)** Dividend stocks pay greater yields compared to T-Bills/bonds/GICs, which had low returns throughout the 2010s during the period of ZIRP and post-2020.  


**(2)** The income stream of dividend stocks is more “reliable” than depending on stock prices. Capital gains and losses fluctuate yearly, but dividend payouts are less variable.  


**(3)** The underlying stocks that pay dividends are thought to be more stable; most investors would consider that companies with excess cash to return in dividends, rather than invest in themselves, are in a safer financial position than growth.  


**(4)** Dividend companies are often (*and wrongly*) associated with “value”. Dividend stocks can and often do have low P/B, P/E, and often trade near book value, but this is not to say that all dividend stocks are priced in terms of value ([for example, PepsiCo at 33 P/E is equal to Apple](https://ycharts.com/companies/PEP/pe_ratio)).  


**(5)** An idea that dividends are “free money”, because you aren’t working for them. This is a very dangerous and flawed way of thinking for investments. For one, *dividends decrease retained earnings*. Two, you can still incur real losses when the underlying stock decreases more than your dividend payout. The fundamental risk-reward tradeoff exists for all investments, including dividend stocks.  


The mechanism of dividends is - at a simple level - fundamentally indifferent to selling stock; stock prices decrease exactly by the dividend payout on the ex-dividend date. [Buffett even argues](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2012ltr.pdf) that **forced dividend payouts are inferior** to letting shareholders decide their own cash-out policies from capital gain, rather than incurring immediate taxes from dividend income and purchasing stock above book value (which is why Berkshire doesn’t pay out dividends).  


Mental accounting is our tendency to sort our money into individual categories, rather than treat them homogeneously. Academics suggest that investors have a flawed mindset, so called the “*free dividend fallacy*” by Hartzmark and Solomon; investors and even mutual funds/institutions subconsciously see dividends and price decreases as fundamentally separate, despite their working knowledge. Individuals tend to treat the gains from dividends as separate from the concept of the share price, and analysts are overambitious when forecasting dividend-paying stocks (due to their negligence the fundamental link between dividends and the underlying stock).   


**Dividend demand increases during periods of low interest yields** \- which argues that investors *do* substitute the former for fixed income, despite the fact that they are **completely different asset classes**.  


*They argue that “... dividend irrelevance runs counter to intuitions from other areas of life, whereby harvesting the fruit from a tree is viewed as fundamentally different to harvesting the tree itself.*  


*”*Here is a quick exercise; remember that there are really no similarities between dividends and bonds. You cannot view the idea of cashflow of $10 from a $100 bond as equivalent to $10 from a $100 stock (which will always drop to $90). **There is no promise of dividend yield nor price security from dividends compared to bonds.** There goes the argument of dividends as a ""safe"" blend of equity and fixed income for retirement.  


I'm not sure why many people think that **dividends are earnings.**  


When a company sells down some assets, they often pay out the value as dividends, so taking only dividends is still depleting your asset base (book value of the stock decreases). Really, where the company obtains the dividend cash isn’t even relevant, whether from profit or assets - it was already part of the company’s assets.  


Companies pay out part of their income as share buybacks, so your dividends are again not representative of company earnings.  


Most importantly, **companies can pay out any amount of their earnings as dividends** (of course, even cutting them unexpectedly). The more they pay out, your retained earnings and business reinvestment, so your **expected earnings growth will be reduced by the dividend payout**. You’re not getting more of a return with a company that pays out a higher percentage of their earnings as dividends.**Dividends are not earnings.** And by not reinvesting your dividends (which is still taxed), you’re **directly drawing down** from your assets, and the **higher your dividend, the more you’re drawing down**.  


Modigliani-Miller’s dividend irrelevance theory isn’t completely applicable in real-life due to taxes (*it actually argues against dividends*), but even more so due to investor psychology. Really, this means that chasing high yields is simply increasing your inefficiency by having more of your income exposed to dividend taxation while the share price still decreases proportionally. Fundamentally, you’re still speculating on the company that pays dividends through future earnings.

A few arguments *for* dividends say that dividends are useful for companies with excess profit. Rather than potentially squandering it in unfruitful M&amp;A/investments by bad management, they would rather return the cash to shareholders (who should, in theory, be able to get greater returns through investing elsewhere). **This is without argument, a fact.**

But dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) into the same stock *doesn’t really compute*; you are both incurring more tax inefficiency by immediately realizing your gain (in the case you’re in a high-income bracket or simply don’t need the cash that year).

Saying that DRIP gives you the power of compound interest doesn’t even make sense either; DRIP or a company not paying out a dividend has the same outcome, and any asset with growth experiences compounding. It used to be hailed as a useful method of reinvestment because of commission-free purchases and at times - even discounts of around 2-3% on stock - but this is no longer relevant with modern brokerages and low trading costs. *The caveat is that it is still useful in registered accounts* (where it would be more inefficient to transfer money out rather than directly reinvest to your position).

Another stance is that dividend cashflow maintains a fixed percentage of shareholder ownership compared to selling off stock to substitute dividends; therefore reducing your ownership as a % over time. This holds no water either.Suppose you have two stocks under the condition of perpetual growth of 10%, one that pays its excess earnings in the form of dividends and the other that chooses to retain them (at the same growth rate of the company). Both are initially priced at $100. An investor who owns 1 share must sell 0.1 shares to match the first dividend payout of $10. To match the second dividend, he sells 0.091 shares (because his share price is now $110), to match the third, .083. After 50 dividends, they have 0.01031 shares left, but the share price is $9,700/share.

Eventually, your stock price approaches infinity while your shares sold per period nears 0%. Most investors likely aren’t proxy voting, so we can realistically brush aside those benefits; which are much less than that of the income tax drag you have realized on the way.

**Dividend Outperformance**  


Before you state that high-dividend yield stocks have [better returns than the S&amp;P 500 in the long run](https://www.tacitacapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/High-Dividend-Strategy-under-the-Microscope.pdf) \- which they have and may or may not do so in the future- consider that many of these companies are typically smaller in size (less than $5B) and in low-growth sectors (consumer staples/utilities/REITs). Why does this matter? Well, because of [as part of Fama/French’s 5 factor model](https://www.tacitacapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/High-Dividend-Strategy-under-the-Microscope.pdf). Historically, investing in value in-turn beat high-yield dividend strategies across global markets with higher risk adjusted returns. If that’s the case, then why not simply skip to the next best thing: value?  


**Gains are not Losses**  
Suppose that you argue that dividends are the key to keeping your investing habit stable; you enjoy seeing the consistent dividend cashflow come out of your account, leading you to continue your habit/motivation. Perhaps you are a follower prospect theory - which states that investors value gains and losses differently, with losses being more emotionally impactful. You prefer the (fairly) certain dividend, versus tracking the ups and downs of stock appreciation. Proponents of DRIP are reasonably happy in the long-term; they never perceive that dividend as entering their  “account” or “leaving” when it becomes reinvested. They see greater numbers of shares owned, less perceived losses (DCA in down periods, which reduces your average cost and subsequently your captain gain/loss).  


But what about those that don’t? Greed is a natural human instinct; there is no denying it. The implications for investing are huge; investors want to spend more now rather than save for the future. They pick and over allocate capital to income-producing assets due to a ""spend it today"" mindset, which is especially relevant if you perceive dividends as “excess” cash or spend it frivolously. In the long-term horizon, it’s likely you will miss out on substantial long-term wealth growth.  


This post is not to say that investing in dividend stocks is never a correct choice - far from so. I just wanted to address the misconceptions surrounding dividends that are spouted so often and how they're somehow a superior option.

The bottom line is your investing mindset - especially for young individuals or those with a long timeframe - should be to maximize your total returns, which is likely not in dividend-focused investments (and especially not in relation to yield chasing). If dividends are the factor that motivates you into saving more instead of traditional investing, then so be it; allocate a small portion to that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think dividend stocks are fundamentally misunderstood by the majority of investors.

634,investing,"There has been a lot of movement in markets in the last year, and it is time for an update. 

Stocks have shot up and are now much less attractive. After selling off for most of 2022, bonds have levelled off, but the yield curve remains strongly inverted, making T-bills more attractive than long duration bonds. Commodities have been selling off, have found a floor, and are pulling up, and as such are more attractive now. 

I'm now recommending commodities for a significant portion of your portfolio, if you have a high risk tolerance, followed by T-bills, followed by stocks, until they lose their momentum.

My analysis (which I keep updated) is here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing)

If you have a different quantitative leading indicator that you prefer, I'd be interested in trying it out.

**I use the following predictors / valuation measures:**

*Stocks:*

Jesse Livermore's Average Investor Equity Allocation (AIEA) has the best performance that I’ve found.

Briefly, AIEA is (Stocks Owned) / (Stocks + Bonds + Cash Owned) by the entire market. It can be thought of as a slow-moving fear/greed indicator, where higher values are greedy and lower values are fearful.

AIEA is discussed here: [https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/](https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/), and the raw data is available here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis).

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.87 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 1.29 +/- 2.5%.

Note that with this very low expected return and recent history, this looks like a classic bubble echo: [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Stages\_of\_a\_bubble.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Stages_of_a_bubble.png). We are in the Return to ""normal"" after the Bull Trap. I suspect that the stock market break down after inflation returns or GDP collapses. The more out-of-whack this valuation gets, the less it will take to pop.

*Bonds:*

The mechanism used for the model is that the bonds held are traded each month for new bonds at the new interest rate. This takes into account the effect of changing interest rates on the value of bonds held, but not taxes or fees. Coupon payments are reinvested. The given interest rate for the current ten year bond is a good (though not perfect) predictor for what the ten year return will be. The data comes from [http://www.econ.yale.edu/\~shiller/data/ie\_data.xls](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls)

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.86 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 4.07 +/- 2.0%

With the treasury yield curve being strongly inverted ([https://www.ustreasuryyieldcurve.com/b/7TLKAL](https://www.ustreasuryyieldcurve.com/b/7TLKAL)), you are not compensated for the significant inflation risk of buying long duration bonds. I recommend 2-6 month T-bills, which are currently yielding around 5.5%.

*Commodities:*

The best predictor that I found was GSCI/GDP. GSCI is S&amp;P’s commodity index, with records back to 1970 here: [https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gsci](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gsci). GDP is the U.S. gross domestic product, with data here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP). This implies that there is a natural level of investment in commodities, compared to GDP.

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.63 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 14.95 +/- 10%. The high uncertainty here is largely because the correlation got markedly worse in 2005, around the time of global financial crisis. Commodities suffered a bubble and pop, with a peak in June of 2008. In addition to the demand fluctuation related to the global financial crisis, this was the time that massive oil and natural gas investment was occurring, which ended up crashing the prices until recently.

WTI Oil has an extremely hard resistance at $67, caused by the Saudis and the Americans defending the price (and possibly the Chinese), and has recently broken upwards out of its downward trend. As such, it looks very promising. However, because of the significant uncertainty in my quantitative analysis, I wouldn't recommend going all in in commodities.

**Back testing:**

I worked out an optimal back tested strategy ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing) \-&gt; Data sheet, toward the right). With this I find the following CAGRs, from January, 1970 to January, 2023.

Stocks only: 10.45%

Bonds only: 6.78%

Commodities only: 6.90%

Stock and Bonds: 12.21%

Stocks and Commodities and Bonds: 16.42%.

For each of these, I use the indicators from three months prior to the current date. This happens to give better results, as well as being possible without a time machine. I switch the entire portfolio to the best investment once a month, using the following procedure:

&amp;#x200B;

    if(stock return &gt; bond return + 0.8%) {
       if (stock return &gt; commodity return - 13.8%) {
          buy stocks
       } else {
          buy commodities
       }
    
    } else { 
        if (bond return &gt; commodity return + 0.5%) {
           buy bonds
       } else {
           buy commodities
       }
    }     

Predicted stock return = -0.65 \* AIEA+0.328

Predicted bond return = 0.0107 \* GS10 - 00161.

Predicted commodity return =  - 0.593 \* GSCI/GDP  + 0.226

Currently, this procedure recommends commodities.

**Actual Results:**

I've been doing this long enough, and posting about it to reddit long enough, that I can start to have a verified track record, as opposed to back testing only. This only includes what I posted to reddit, not what I've actually done with my portfolio, which is significantly more complicated and impossible to prove.

*March 2021, recommended stocks* [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/meu01j/bonds\_vs\_stocks\_and\_short\_term\_returns\_now\_is\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/meu01j/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_not/)

This is the default case, so no comment

*July 2021, recommended bonds* [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds\_vs\_stocks\_and\_short\_term\_returns\_now\_is\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_the/)

This performed much worse than I expected. I was correct that stocks were in danger. I made the faulty assumption that bonds are low risk. The combination of very low initial interest rates and the surprise (to me) very high inflation caused the worst bond sell off in US history. I did not see this coming.

*April 2022, recommended commodities* [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u64m1i/stocks\_vs\_bonds\_vs\_commodities/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u64m1i/stocks_vs_bonds_vs_commodities/)

This performed okay, I guess. But the recommendation was late (after Russian invaded Ukraine).

*October 2022, recommended stocks*

My timing here was impeccable, and much better than most of the professionals that I follow.

In the table ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing) \-&gt; Reddit record), I'm shifting the dates one month later, to avoid any hint of look ahead bias.

Following my recommendations would have lead an account to rise from 100 to 102. Doing stocks alone would rise to 112. Bonds alone would fall to 86. Commodities alone would risen from 100 to 142. So my practical, reddit return is mediocre, primarily because of how badly I whiffed on the bonds recommendation. There was also some chasing the last good thing, with commodities. Using my current rules in a back test, the account would have risen from 100 to 144 (and been almost completely commodities till now).

**Warnings**

* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.
* AIEA measures a natural level for stock vs bond ownership. This is not a fundamental parameter, with an underlying theory about why the natural level should be where it is, or will remain the same in the future.
* Though GSCI/GDP feels like it could be fundamental parameter, it leaves out important phenomena, like the changing structure of the economy, as well as paradigm shifts in commodity extraction technology.
* I don't take into account taxes or other transaction costs.
* My analysis starts in 1970, because that is when the commodities data becomes available. This is a smaller data set than I ‘d like.
* I’m using the S&amp;P 500, 10 year US treasuries, and GSCI because they have long data sets, not because I consider them to be optimal investments.
* GSCI is dominated by the price of oil, like how the S&amp;P is dominated by a small number of mega tech companies, but even more so.
* My verifiable track record currently under performs VOO and chill.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of movement in markets in the last year, and it is time for an update. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;My analysis starts in 1970, because that is when the commodities data becomes available. This is a smaller data set than I ‘d like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m using the S&amp;amp;P 500, 10 year US treasuries, and GSCI because they have long data sets, not because I consider them to be optimal investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GSCI is dominated by the price of oil, like how the S&amp;amp;P is dominated by a small number of mega tech companies, but even more so.&lt;/li&gt;

636,investing,"TLDR: Swapping from Edward Jones to Schwab and looking for traditional IRA and other recommendations. \*Apologies for the following novel!

  
Hey folks, I am looking for some strategic advice. I started investing three years ago when I finished active-duty military service. My wife and I stupidly didn’t save or invest any money during my 20 years of service, so no IRAs or TSP starting off. We collectively were living paycheck-to-paycheck during my military service based on terrible spending habits.

  
In 2021 we sold a house which netted us around $150k. We bought another (at 2.499 interest) but put very little down because we used our VA loan and I wanted to feel the security of having cash on hand. We have kept the rest of the proceeds in the breakdown below. Not really knowing what I was doing, I opened accounts with Edward Jones and started throwing money at it. We were able to open the Roth's based on my income then, but have since become ineligible to add to those due to high income. Also, we bought all of the individual stocks and watched them plummet in 2022, but they have since recovered and we are basically back where we started.

  
Fast-forward to now, we still spend what I consider a ridiculous amount of money every month, but we are working to correct it and double-down on investing for retirement. I started working with a great company that does a 5% match with John Hancock, and I am maxing that contribution every year (about $20k) with 75% into RFHTX and 25% into the 500 Index Fund. I am not looking to change that allocation unless folks have a compelling recommendation. Additionally, we have roughly $5k/month that is unused (saved) and put in our normal bank savings account which is really giving us no return, about 60 dollars a month, so not really sure what to do there… I should note that I plan to work for at least the next 15-20 years and expect my current income level to remain static or increase.  


So my questions are:   
\-	As we are moving into Schwab, what index funds or ETFs would make the most sense for the Roth IRAs?  
\-	Should we be maxing out Traditional IRAs with the intent to do a backdoor conversion later?   
\-	What should be done with the cash that we have in our bank’s low-interest savings account?  
\-	Are we on track or do I need to make some drastic move like taking savings and paying off vehicles / dropping the savings into my mortgage to reduce it / other?  
  
One thought I have is to make the transition to Schwab and put the Roth’s/529s into whatever the advisor recommends. Then liquidating the $50,000 in individual stocks from EJ, put that money into a MMF with Schwab and use that money to fund Traditional IRAs for my wife and I. Would this be a smart move?  
  
Below are some of our financial stats:

661,investing,"Hi guys,

I am wondering if any of you have long/short portfolios (similar to hedge funds) and have some success with it. 

I have decent knowledge on investing/trading in general but never paid attention to hedging out market risk when building a portfolio, but I am quite interested in creating something like this as a side portfolio.

My thought is; i am going 200% long and 100% short (so double the long exposure compared to short) and instead of going short individual stocks, I am going short the market ETF (in my case DAX, Germany) and I will go long individual stocks (anywhere from 5 to 10). Since I have some experience in short term trading I am quite okay at predicting next 3 mnths out for small listed companies so I am planning to recycles these shares into new ones probably every earnings release.

I know hedge funds use sophisticated models to rebalance, have the right position sizes etc, I know I am limited (in terms of knowledge but also resources) to do this so I will keep it simple and try to position size based on the beta of the stock (past year) and volatility (measured last 200days). I will basically compare these to the overall market and position size accordingly. After that I basically multiply this value by 2x since this is a 2/1 portfolio.

Also correlations... this one is hard to get my head around since I want to be hedged when the market goes down so my mind would think I need to have low correlations but on the other hand why even hedge if you have low correlation since there would be no market risk then right? Anyway, I will try and keep correlations below .5 (so between my longs, but also my longs compared to short DAX etf)

My thought is that since I am not managing billions like hedge funds I somehow have better edge since I can get better prices.

Am I on the right track doing something like this or am I completely off? Just curious :)

Thanks a lot!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am wondering if any of you have long/short portfolios (similar to hedge funds) and have some success with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have decent knowledge on investing/trading in general but never paid attention to hedging out market risk when building a portfolio, but I am quite interested in creating something like this as a side portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thought is; i am going 200% long and 100% short (so double the long exposure compared to short) and instead of going short individual stocks, I am going short the market ETF (in my case DAX, Germany) and I will go long individual stocks (anywhere from 5 to 10). Since I have some experience in short term trading I am quite okay at predicting next 3 mnths out for small listed companies so I am planning to recycles these shares into new ones probably every earnings release.&lt;/p&gt;

What do you use your regular brokerage account for? That account is more “liquid” so do you just buy something like VOO as a savings account for bigger purchases like a car?

So, I deposited the $6500 contribution limit at the beginning of the year. I then got married to my wife. And about a month ago I realized our combined income will be over the income limit. 

I recharacterized to a traditional IRA in schwab. They recharacterized about $6,9xx for whatever reason. I then did a backdoor roth and moved the $6,9xx back to the Roth IRA. 

I was just wondering if transferring the $6,9xx back to the Roth IRA is “going over” the $6,500 contribution for the year even though it was already in my account before?

691,investing,"Howdy!

I (33M/only child) come from humble upbringings. No one in my family has money. My dad and mother are both in separate nursing homes due to mental illness. They survive on SS/disability. I have no one to teach me. I'm alone in my new city.

I have recently come into a good job. I currently make xxx and in 5 years or so I will be making upwards of xxx. My 401k match from my company is great. This year I will hit the IRS limit for the first time in my life and I plan to continue to do so until I retire. I also invest $60 per paycheck into my ESPP (employee stock purchase program).

I bought a house last year financed for 350k at 3.375%. It's a fixer upper and will eventually need a full remodel. I'd like to eventually rent it out so that I can begin making passive income and allowing others to pay off my mortgage, but that could be years down the line due to costs associated with necessary remodeling, etc. After renting this property, I think it'd be nice to do the same on another property, rinse and repeat, but is real estate the way to go??

To summarize, I (1) invest 20% into my 401k, (2) invest slowly into my property equity with the hopes to rent, and (3) invest $3000 per year into my ESPP at a 10% discount.

I'd like to be work-optional in 20 years. As a staunch minimalist, I envision myself driving around the country in a van visiting National Parks, camping, and living off the passive income of a few rental properties as well as slowly withdrawing from a personal account until eligible to withdraw from my 401k at retirement age.

What should I learn about investing in the mean time? Should I start talking with a financial advisor at Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard about secondary investment strategies? I'm concerned about fees. Should I download Robinhood and start gambling? Should I take out a life insurance policy as an investment strategy like my uncle suggests? Everyone seems to say NO to life insurance in this way, but he swears by it.

I can feel that this moment in time will be pivotal to my future success and I want to go into this by being as educated and thorough as possible.

Does this mean that something increased the demand for one of their products in between Q1 and Q2? If so wouldn’t they be hyping that news ahead of time?

Does this mean that they just reduced expenses by 2 billion in between quarters? That seems like a lot of expenses.

Sorry if this is an elementary question but I’d love to hear some ways in which the actual free cash flow number can be so wildly off the predicted mark.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone -&lt;/p&gt;

I have endeavored to read all the links posted thus far and the pertinent sections on the wiki, but it's possible I missed something, so here we go.  
  
a) It looks like Vanguard Lifestrategy is the go-to fund for investors outside the USA, since it is domiciled in Ireland and has all the fixings - good asset allocation, exposure and returns. I've seen it mentioned quite a few times in my search. I believe it also automatically rebalances?  
  
This looks like what I am looking for as a non-USA citizen, I cannot buy the funds usually mentioned. I'm thinking of using Interactive Brokers. (there is another broker with even cheaper brokerage fees, moomoo, but I'm not certain they offer this fund)  
  
b) After looking at target date retirement funds more, I'm not seeing how they outperform the above. Should I just go with Vanguard Lifestrategy?  
  
c) I am using YTD as my main valuation of a fund's performance (though of course I do look at the other areas, performance against benchmark, historical performance etc) Is this sound?  
  
d) I am assuming the reason why certain funds keep being recommended is because of their performance relative to locally performing funds...I took a look at some Singapore ETFs  
  
and I was not impressed by their performance. Even after accounting for the fact that dividends will be taxed, the global/Vanguard funds seem to come out ahead?  
  
e) I would also be looking to generate some dividends as a form of passive income while the bulk of my money is growing itself. AFAIK there is no way to take out a portion of the dividends as payout. So should I :  
  
\- buy another fund for my passive income needs or  
  
\- buy another fund, grow it and then sell it  
  
I would rather leave as little money as possible in the bank at any given time because it's not generating income for me. As I earn less than 60k a year (including passive income) I also believe I will not be taxed on that?

&lt;p&gt;This looks like what I am looking for as a non-USA citizen, I cannot buy the funds usually mentioned. I&amp;#39;m thinking of using Interactive Brokers. (there is another broker with even cheaper brokerage fees, moomoo, but I&amp;#39;m not certain they offer this fund)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) After looking at target date retirement funds more, I&amp;#39;m not seeing how they outperform the above. Should I just go with Vanguard Lifestrategy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) I am using YTD as my main valuation of a fund&amp;#39;s performance (though of course I do look at the other areas, performance against benchmark, historical performance etc) Is this sound?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d) I am assuming the reason why certain funds keep being recommended is because of their performance relative to locally performing funds...I took a look at some Singapore ETFs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I was not impressed by their performance. Even after accounting for the fact that dividends will be taxed, the global/Vanguard funds seem to come out ahead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e) I would also be looking to generate some dividends as a form of passive income while the bulk of my money is growing itself. AFAIK there is no way to take out a portion of the dividends as payout. So should I :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- buy another fund for my passive income needs or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- buy another fund, grow it and then sell it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would rather leave as little money as possible in the bank at any given time because it&amp;#39;s not generating income for me. As I earn less than 60k a year (including passive income) I also believe I will not be taxed on that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very appreciative of all of the help that the more experienced people here have rendered. Looking forwards to learning more on my investing journey.&lt;/p&gt;

This whole thing strikes me as a bit bizarre tbh.

I work in a firm that helps people deal with bank closures so I see people getting their accounts closed extremely often. My firm has successfully argued on multiple occasions that these banks are actively discriminating against individuals (particularly of Iranian descent) and sought compensation, however, it's definitely an uphill battle and very little attention is given to these cases in the media.

The fact is, banks can technically close your account for any reason, and they don't have to give you a reason or any notice when closing your account. My clients don't have the same media backing as Nigel Farage, so they're often left waiting months or even years before any sort of resolution, and even the Financial Ombudsman usually rules in the bank's favour.

I'm interested to see the political fallout from this. The govt has his back and even the opposition seem to support him in this endeavour. Hopefully it's not just conservative mouthpieces being afforded any forthcoming protections.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

price = 97.335722

days_to_maturity = 182

and number of days in year is 366 because of a leap year.

the rate is indeed the one one quoted on the treasury website of 5.5%

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original problem:
So I just bought the 6 month T bill with serial 912797FC6 with my broker. The treasury website's coupon rate results table says the coupon rate is 5.504%. My broker displays like 5.47%. Meanwhile, both broker and treasury shows the price per $100 as being 97.335722. Now once I do 100 - 97.335722 = 2.664278 x 2 = 5.328556. So neither the 5.504% nor 5.47% nor 5.329% match here. What's happening? What's the true coupon rate?

edit: i actually found an explanation for this by another reddit here

https://www.reddit.com/r/bonds/comments/x3mhxw/high_rate_vs_investment_rate_for_treasury_direct/iz5qof2/

also a partial answer by someone in this comment second using the correct formula

97.335722(1+r/2) = 100

r = 2(100/97.335722-1) = 0.054744 or 5.4744%

edit2: it seems a few people have told me that my broker gave me a worse price. this is not true. according to the treasury website's bond price, i am also getting the same with my broker.

For reference, on Schwab this is how these yields are defined:

* TTM: Distribution Yield is the Trailing 12-Month End Yield - Morningstar computes this figure by summing the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the sum by the last month's ending Net Asset Value (NAV), plus capital gains distributed over the same time period. Income refers only to interest payments from fixed-income securities and dividend payments from common stocks.

* 30-day SEC Yield: The net investment income earned by a fund over a 30-day period displayed as of month-end. The 30-day SEC Yield is expressed as an annual percentage rate based on the fund's share price. It is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by the maximum offering price per share on that date.

Investing into S&amp;P Tech will give me big Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA but not the other companys. Investing into NASDAQ 100 will give me all of them, but with a lower Rate (can be good can be bad). And of course i just can buy those 6 Stocks.  


I think Apple (even if they dont have LLMs yet) will be big in AI in 1-2 Years and the capability shipping local AI on all of their devices are insane.  Huge potential here + we talk about Apple.

I know I'd rather have $10,000 or so more in retirement than having less and having my portfolio look more pretty with a bunch of ETFs that are underperformers, but make me feel clever. If you enjoy having less money then just stop reading here. If you have a ""pretty"" portfolio, but want to make more, than read on.

I have read advice about people investing in things like VTI, when it is inferior to the likes of VOO. I understand that VTI is conceptually more attractive since it includes all the stocks in the US rather than the top 500. The bottom line is that underperforms VOO and will continue to do so, it is as simple as that.

I have even read people say to get VT, because now you own the world. Dude, just get VOO, because you're going to make more money. ""Well you never know, the US could go to hell yada yada"", yeah I guess it could, but let's be real. VT performed 31.9% in the past 5 years, VOO performed 61.39% in the past 5 years. You really want to give up those returns based on your own hunch that a black swan could happen?! ""Past results don't predict future results"", maybe so, but be reasonable. The US has the highest GDP in the world by a good margin. Even if the US falls below number 1 in GDP, it will still be better owning companies there than owning some rando company in Africa.

There is another strategy of investing in VXUS and VTI together while rebalancing every year. Maybe this makes you feel smart, but you are making this more complicated than it needs to be and just lowering your return. Just buy VOO.

VOO is also better than SPY because the expense ratio is 0.03% instead of 0.09%. The difference is not terribly significant, but over time it isn't trivial.

Stop trying to make your portfolio pretty with all these different ETFs to make you feel more diversified. VOO is diversified enough and it is a powerhouse at creating wealth.

Here's some ways I've identified, I'm sure there's more but I want to know why some are better than others and what you all do.

Starting example;

Month 1:

\- (Month 1 they were all 100$ and 25% allocation)

Beginning of month 2:

\- A doubled, $200 balance and 40% of portfolio

\- B rose,        $120 balance and 24% of portfolio

\- C (flat)         $100 balance and 20% of portfolio

\- D fell,          $ 80 balance and 16% of portfolio

**Static Equal-Weight**

Would add $100 monthly to each, no matter what.

**Catch-Up / Help out the ""Losers""**

Currently valued at $500, and would be adding $400, so 1/4 of the total is $225. They would add $25 to A, $105 to B, $125 to C, and $145 to D.

**ETF-Style / Pile onto ""Winners""**

Would now add 40% of their contribution to A, 24% to B, etc.

**Magnified ETF-Style**

Greatly increases exposure to winners and decreases exposure to losers. Starts with a constant magnification rate &gt;1 (let's say 2).

\- A's share rose 15%, so multiply by the rate to get 30%

\- C's share fell 5%, multiplied would be -10%

Would allocate like this:

\- A: 55% \[25 + 2 \* (40 - 25)\]

\- B: 23%

\- C: 15%

\- D: 7%  \[25 + 2 \* (16 - 25)\]

**Dynamic Equal-Weight** (Less applicable in this example)

Would buy and \*sell\* in order to keep all at 25%

I recently started a job where I have access to two 401a accounts, a 403b, and a 457b, all through my employer. I am currently maxing out my 401a accounts and my 403b. I am also doing a BD Roth and maxing that out for my wife and I. I have my own individual brokerage account as well. 

My financial advisor is not advising against it, but he is wary about the 457b (reasons such as the idea of deferred salary, solvency concerns, ability to transfer if I change jobs, etc…). Even with these other accounts maxed out in contributions, I still have some money left over I want to invest long term for retirement (from the 20% of my total salary).  One of the options he suggested was looking into a Variable Universal Life policy and using it as a means to invest long term. The policy has access to investing in large cap index funds with relatively low maintenance costs. I have researched VULs and am aware of how they can be utilized for long term investing, borrowing against the policy when withdrawing to avoid taxes at the cost of some interest, the fees associated with VULs, etc…

What are your thoughts on VULs? Should I just take the rest of my savings allocation and dump it into my individual brokerage account and index funds and pay the capital gains taxes instead?

Before anyone gets on me about my financial advisor and the advice I’m getting, I’ve been with him for 5 years, everything we’ve talked about are always open discussions and never posited like a snake oil salesman throwing me a pitch.

But why is the interest rate shown as 3.38%? 

I know I mistakenly deposited and bought another 10k of I-bond while the supposed limit is 10k/year. Otherwise I think I'll have to pay the tax/penalty on the interest earn on that extra 10k.

&lt;p&gt;I had been contributing to a Roth IRA through the &amp;quot;front door&amp;quot; for about 10 years. Recently, my wife and I have had our joint income exceed the max so I am no longer contributing to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actively contribute 10% of my salary to an employer 403b, and also get an 8% match - i.e. 18% of salary invested annually.  I also separately have a standard brokerage accounts for emergency savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary of investments below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roth has $20K &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;403b has $250K&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emergency brokerage accts have $45K&lt;/p&gt;

One ETF I have is PDBC - my cost basis is about $15k and market value around $12k, so great trade there eh? I did get a dividend of about $1k last December but it's not clear to me if it's paying another.

Here's where it gets weird. On eTrade, I see an annual yield of 13.42% and MorningStart shows a 12 month trailing yield of 14.15%. However looking at the ETF details, it says it consists of about 47% US Treasury Bills and just under 35% of another US Government Money Portfolio, IUGXX with a yield of about 3,72%. That leaves about 25% unknown, but I can't see any mathematical way this ETF can generate a 13% dividend.

Hello Investing,

32M, I have no kids of my own and not sure that I ever want to, but have the two sweetest nieces in the world who are both under 8 years old. I have had some great career opportunities over the past few years and find myself with a significant amount of disposable income at the end of each month. I’m already maxing out 401k, ESPP, and have a very comfortable emergency fund as well as a cash reserve for a down payment on a house if this market ever cools down. 

I’m interested in setting some money aside each month in an account specifically for each of them for when they’re ready for college/trade school/whatever productive thing they decide to do when they’re adults. My sister is a teacher and her husband is owns a small business and they do fine financially, but I would love to give the girls opportunities and possibly take some financial burden off of my sister and her husband. 

I would love some guidance or advice on avenues to achieve this, I’m thinking $500-$1000 each to start an account and then chipping in $50-$100 per month so long as I’m still in a position to do so. 

Are there any considerations or watch-outs for this since I am not their legal guardian, and is there anything i should consider as ways to protect them from themselves? (I was 18 once and can’t imagine what I’d have done if a lump of cash fell in my lap)

Thank you in advance!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Investing,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have an Etrade Margin account that I just upgraded to a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I bought stock A and then an hour later sold stock A for a small loss (The entire position hit my Stop on Quote).  I then bought stock B for all (100%) of the proceeds recovered from sale of stock A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now sitting with about a 30% gain in stock B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I sell stock B today (now) or do I have to wait for the T+2 days for the sale of stock A to clear?  I wasn’t sure if the margin account afforded me any wiggle room from this rule.  I just don’t want my account to become restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

826,investing,"**EDIT:** After reading some replies I understand I need to add some clarifications. I’m trying to compare a passive index fund that tracks the S&amp;P 500 vs a passive ETF that does the same. For instance tickers VFIAX vs VOO just as an example.

What are the real world tax implications of an ETF vs. Index Fund (not mutual fund)? I’m getting ready to start serious retirement investing and trying to make a decision on where to invest at least in the beginning.

I’ve done a lot of research and understand the how and why the taxes are handled differently across the two types of funds. However I was hoping to get an idea of the real tax implications of index funds. It seems like good I.F. shouldn’t see much of a capital gains tax burden since they don’t change much and once you account for the fund purchasing shares.

TLDR; Trying to understand just how much of a tax burden capital gains are for an index fund vs. ETF. I’m looking to invest long term and index funds are more appealing to me but a little concerned about the tax burden.

836,investing,"We have three G8 central bank meetings next week: the Fed, the ECB and the BOJ. Below, you can find the comments of every Fed speaker since their last meeting in June.

If you find this helpful: I publish info about central bank events and speakers weekly, check out my profile.

**Here are the comments sorted by most recent first:**

* **Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-7-14 T-7:** There is a path to curb inflation without recession.
* **Daly  (Neutral)  2023-7-13 T-8:** Going to continue to work on rate hikes until we are sure that inflation is on the path to come back down toward 2%, the good news on inflation this week is indeed good news but too early to say we can declare victory, saying that we needed two hikes was a way to keep optionality open, cumulative effects of monetary tightening still to work their way through the system, thought that the banking crisis could be worth 1 to 2 tightenings but not seeing that impact, as inflation starts coming down we can start lowering the nominal rate to bring real rates down to neutral levels, wants to start heading towards the neutral rate as we approach 2% on inflation.
* **Waller  (Hawk)  2023-7-13 T-8:** September is a live meeting for monetary policy, in favour of raising rates at the July meeting, likely to need two more 25 basis point rate hikes this year, the bulk of past rate hikes already have impacted economy, economic strength gives the Fed space to hike further, fighting inflation remains main goal, cooler CPI data is welcome but need to see if it is sustained, inflation has shown false dawns before, the jobs market has slowed but remains strong, a soft landing for the economy is still possible.
* **Barkin  (Neutral)  2023-7-12 T-9:** Inflation is still too high, still a question whether inflation can settle while labour market remains as strong as it is, comfortable doing more with policy if incoming data does not confirm inflation will return to target.
* **Kashkari  (Hawk)  2023-7-12 T-9:** May need to raise rates further if high inflation persists, the fight against inflation must succeed, bank supervisors should ensure all banks are prepared to withstand higher rate environment.
* **Barr  (Neutral)  2023-7-10 T-11:** Inflation is far too high, we are quite attentive to bringing it down to target, we have made a lot of progress on inflation, still have a bit of work to do, the need for regulators to focus on bank resilience broadly has been reinforced by recent bank failures.
* **Bostic  (Neutral)  2023-7-10 T-11:** There's no expectation of needing to raise rates further, this is a hard judgment call, the path forward is no longer obvious, even with a 25 bps move at the next meeting it will still require patience, it's a ""pretty straightforward story"" that inflation could return to 2% without rates rising further, a lot of the strength in the economy is due to pandemic support, inflation is too high and not sustainable, there are no expectations for a daramatic sea change in inflation, the biggest risk is not moving inflation back to target and all of the Fed is in consensus on that view, the trajectory on inflation right now is ""in the right direction"", policy is clearly in restrictive territory and the Fed can be patient, would not be comfortable if inflation stalls or expectations rise, right now expectations are pretty well anchored.
* **Daly  (Neutral)  2023-7-10 T-11:** There is more we need to do to raise rates, risks have become more balanced, sees the need for two more rate hikes this year to bring inflation back to 2% goal, the precise number of hikes may be adjusted based on economic data, the risk of underacting continues to outweigh the risk of overacting but these risks are becoming more balanced.
* **Mester  (Hawk)  2023-7-10 T-11:** The Fed will need to tighten somewhat further to lower inflation, no decision yet on the need for a July hike, the outlook for the terminal rate matches or is just above June's median forecast, there was a preference for a June hike but there's an understanding as to why there wasn't any action taken, closer to the end of the tightening campaign than to the start, policy is less restrictive compared to history, raising rates again will reduce the risk of more action in the future, the economy has proven stronger than expected, core inflation remains too high and broad-based, wage pressures remain too high to get inflation back to 2%, business leaders' fears of a recession have declined, too early to say the neutral rate has shifted much.
* **Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-7-7 T-14:** Sees 1-2 more rate hikes this year, I haven't seen anything that says one or two more hikes this year is wrong, still undecided on July hike, I feel like we're on the golden path to ""no recession and the inflation target"", the job market is outstanding, there's a lag to monetary policy, inflation is down somewhat but needs to come down more,  
* **Logan  (Neutral)  2023-7-6 T-15:** More rate hikes are likely necessary, would have been okay with a June hike, challenging and uncertain environment enabled June pause, very concerned whether inflation will cool quickly enough, skeptical about the lagged impact of past rate hikes, the housing market may have bottomed out, the Fed has room to shrink the balance sheet for quite some time.
* **Williams  (Neutral)  2023-7-5 T-16:** Slowing down rate rises makes sense right now, future rate rises are still in play, fully supported the Fed's decision to hold rates steady at the June FOMC, not content with where inflation is right now, open question how fast inflation will cool next year, fighting inflation remains the Fed's main job, the economy has handled rate hikes ""reasonably well"", surprised to see the resilience of the housing market, the economy still has a strong demand for labour.
* **Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-6-30 T-21:** There is nothing in the Fed's mandate about stock prices, I hope the market remains sober, have to see through the market's ups and downs, have not made up my mind on rates, there is a number of data releases before the next Fed meeting, there is a lag in the impact of interest rates on the economy, hopeful we can get inflation down to target without a recession, the strongest part of the economic data is the labour market.
* **Bostic  (Neutral)  2023-6-29 T-22:** I don't see as much urgency to move as stated by others, nobody should take a signal from my view that we should pause, we're not seeing inflation moving away from target, comfortable waiting, there are undoubtedly scenarios where we could move at two meetings in a row but not expecting that will happen, will do more if needed, less concerned about high inflation.
* **Bostic 2023-6-29 T-22:** Not ready to rule out further rate hikes if required but does not see need, does not see Fed rate cuts in 2023 or 2024, monetary policy has only recently moved into restrictive territory, effects of monetary policy tightening are starting to show up in the real economy, policy in place to bring inflation back to 2% target, it's unambiguous that inflation has fallen considerably, inflation is in a gradual cooling trend that should continue, inflation should cool even if Fed leaves current policy in place, expects to reach inflation goal without causing severe downturn.
* **Powell  (Neutral)  2023-6-29 T-22:** The process of getting to 2% inflation target has a long way to go, expects moderate pace of interest rate decisions to continue, a strong majority of the FOMC expects it to be appropriate to hike rates two or more times by the end of the year, inflation is well above the goal, the xtent of effects from tighter credit conditions remains uncertain, will take time for the rest of the economy to feel the full impact of rate hikes so far, the labour market is very tight.
* **Powell  (Neutral)  2023-6-28 T-23:** We believe there is more restrictive policy coming, policy hasn't been restrictive for very long, have not made a decision to hike at every other meeting, would not take moving at consecutive meetings off the table, data over the last quarter has been strong, as we get closer and close to the goal the risks become more balanced, haven't seen much progress in non-housing services, high labour costs in non-housing services are causing inflationary pressures, need to see more softening in the labour market.
* **Williams  (Neutral)  2023-6-26 T-25:** Restoring price stability is of ""paramount importance"".
* **Bostic  (Neutral)  2023-6-23 T-28:** Expects jobless rate to rise from historically low level, not seeing elements of risk appearing in the economy, credit risk is likely coming and real estate could pose a risk, the banking sector is quite strong.
* **Daly  (Neutral)  2023-6-23 T-28:** Two more rate hikes this year is a ""very reasonable"" projection, it's only a projection and we don't know for sure, prudent to slow the pace of hikes as we approach destination, risks over overtightening and undertightening are about balanced, strongly supported June decision to hold rates and watch the data, credit tightening so far is consistent with what would have been expected without March banking turmoil.
* **Barkin  (Neutral)  2023-6-22 T-29:** Will not prejudge the July meeting, would be content with more hikes if inflation is not progressing towards the goad, would support rate cuts when there is conviction that inflation is heading down, still a good way from the 2% inflation target, demand is still elevated compared with its pre-pandemic trend and boosting inflation but it does seem it's weakening.
* **Bowman  (Neutral)  2023-6-22 T-29:** Additional rate hikes will be needed to reach sufficiently restrictive level, inflation still ""unacceptably high"" despite drop in headline number, core inflation has essentially plateaued since the fall of 2022, will look for inflation on a consistent downward path in deciding appropriate policy steps at coming meetings.
* **Powell  (Neutral)  2023-6-22 T-29:** A strong majority feels there is a little further to go on rate hikes, decision last week was to move more slowly, we kept rates on hold to give ourselves more time to make a decision, headline inflation has come down but that's largely from energy and food and not principally a function of monetary policy, we still have a long way to go, we have not seen much progress in the way of services inflation, we expect inflation to move down this year, I see a path for inflation to continue falling with little increase in unemployment.
* **Bostic  (Neutral)  2023-6-21 T-30:** Rates should stay where they are for the rest of the year, does not see rate cuts for most of 2024, further rate hikes may needlessly drain the economy, wants to give the economy more time to adjust to rate hikes before doing more, policy has not been restrictive for long enough for its effects to be felt so it's prudent to wait, maintaining the current rate will be passive tightening of the real rate that will still aid in fighting inflation, risk of inflation rebounding is ""not my baseline"", some further slowing of the labour market may be necessary, contagion that was feared from earlier bank failures has not materialized.
* **Cook  (Neutral)  2023-6-21 T-30:** We are not there yet on getting inflation back to target, there isn't much here to indicate any unease about hiking in July.
* **Jefferson  (Neutral)  2023-6-21 T-30:** Recent bank troubles present downside economic risk, watching commercial real estate for risks.
* **Powell  (Neutral)  2023-6-21 T-30:** Nearly all FOMC participants expect it will be appropriate to raise rates somewhat further by year end, the two hikes pencilled into the dot plot is a pretty good guess of what will happen, a big majority believes in raising rates twice this year, the level for rates and speed of hikes are separate, it may make sense to move rates higher at more moderate pace, the Fed is now moderating the pace of rate hikes, will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, we never use the word pause and wouldn't use that here today, the process of getting inflation back to 2% ""has a long way to go"", will take time to see full effects of policy tightening, tighter credit likely to weight on economic activity but extent remains uncertain, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, factors contributing to inflation decline are happening but later than expected, it is important that the balance sheet doesn't just grow with every cycle, balance sheet should be smaller than now but need a buffer against scarce reserves, don't want to be in the same position as last reduction cycle, there is a gradual cooling in the labour market but we're not there yet, still significant labour shortages, the US dollar is still the dominant reserve currency.
* **Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-6-21 T-30:** Decision last week was a close call for me, have not decided yet on July, the Feds framework is ""wait and see"", perfectly appropriate to have a reconnaissance mission now, trying to figure out if we have done enough and how much more needs to be done, probably won't gain enough info in 6 weeks but will learn more, over the next couple months will get a sense if goods inflation is coming down, the lags argument is a tremendously important one.
* **Kugler  (n/a)  2023-6-21 T-30:** Both sides of the Fed's mandate are important, pushing inflation down is the Fed's main mission now.
* **Cook  (Neutral)  2023-6-20 T-31:** Focused on inflation until the job is done.
* **Jefferson  (Neutral)  2023-6-20 T-31:** I remain focused on returning inflation to 2%, inflation has started to abate, must remain attentive to inflation and banking-sector stress, US banking system is sound and resilient, I remain attuned to any threats to banking system stability.
* **Kugler  (n/a)  2023-6-20 T-31:** Deeply committed to setting monetary policy to reduce inflation and promote maximum employment, important to bring inflation down to 2% target.
* **Barkin  (Neutral)  2023-6-16 T-35:** Comfortable doing more on interest rates if the coming data doesn't confirm that slowing demand is returning inflation to the 2% target, higher rates may create the risk of a more significant slowdown, experience of the 1970s shows that the Fed should not back off its inflation fight too soon, inflation has proven stubbornly persistent, still looking to be convinced that weakening demand will control it.
* **Waller  (Hawk)  2023-6-16 T-35:** The US economy is still ripping along, it's disturbing that core inflation is not improving, will probably require more tightening, so far it looks as if the idea of labour market softening without much rise in unemployment is holding up, it's still not clear that recent bank failures have had a material effect on credit conditions.
* **Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-6-16 T-35:** Pausing for now to scope out economic developments, there are conflicting pieces of evidence coming from the economy: is it too hot and we need to do more or have we done enough on rates over the last year?, we're just going to have to play it by ear I guess.
* **Powell  (Neutral)  2023-6-14 T-37:** The full effects of our policy have yet to be felt, nearly all policymakers view some further rate hikes this year as appropriate, inflation has moderated somewhat but still has a long way to go, if the economy evolves as expected the median of participants sees 5.6% FFR at year-end, Fed projections are not a plan or a decision, will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, have not made a decision about July, I expect July to be a live meeting, it's common sense to go a bit slower on rate hikes as we near the destination, inflation risks are still to the upside, not seeing a lot of progress on core PCE, rate cuts are not appropriate this year and no policymaker saw rate cuts this year, economic data came in consistent with but on the high side of expectations, the conditions we need to see in place to get inflation down are coming into place including lower growth labour slack, we don't know the full extent of the banking turmoil.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have three G8 central bank meetings next week: the Fed, the ECB and the BOJ.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the comments sorted by most recent first:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-7-14 T-7:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a path to curb inflation without recession.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daly  (Neutral)  2023-7-13 T-8:&lt;/strong&gt; Going to continue to work on rate hikes until we are sure that inflation is on the path to come back down toward 2%, the good news on inflation this week is indeed good news but too early to say we can declare victory, saying that we needed two hikes was a way to keep optionality open, cumulative effects of monetary tightening still to work their way through the system, thought that the banking crisis could be worth 1 to 2 tightenings but not seeing that impact, as inflation starts coming down we can start lowering the nominal rate to bring real rates down to neutral levels, wants to start heading towards the neutral rate as we approach 2% on inflation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waller  (Hawk)  2023-7-13 T-8:&lt;/strong&gt; September is a live meeting for monetary policy, in favour of raising rates at the July meeting, likely to need two more 25 basis point rate hikes this year, the bulk of past rate hikes already have impacted economy, economic strength gives the Fed space to hike further, fighting inflation remains main goal, cooler CPI data is welcome but need to see if it is sustained, inflation has shown false dawns before, the jobs market has slowed but remains strong, a soft landing for the economy is still possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barkin  (Neutral)  2023-7-12 T-9:&lt;/strong&gt; Inflation is still too high, still a question whether inflation can settle while labour market remains as strong as it is, comfortable doing more with policy if incoming data does not confirm inflation will return to target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kashkari  (Hawk)  2023-7-12 T-9:&lt;/strong&gt; May need to raise rates further if high inflation persists, the fight against inflation must succeed, bank supervisors should ensure all banks are prepared to withstand higher rate environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barr  (Neutral)  2023-7-10 T-11:&lt;/strong&gt; Inflation is far too high, we are quite attentive to bringing it down to target, we have made a lot of progress on inflation, still have a bit of work to do, the need for regulators to focus on bank resilience broadly has been reinforced by recent bank failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bostic  (Neutral)  2023-7-10 T-11:&lt;/strong&gt; There&amp;#39;s no expectation of needing to raise rates further, this is a hard judgment call, the path forward is no longer obvious, even with a 25 bps move at the next meeting it will still require patience, it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;pretty straightforward story&amp;quot; that inflation could return to 2% without rates rising further, a lot of the strength in the economy is due to pandemic support, inflation is too high and not sustainable, there are no expectations for a daramatic sea change in inflation, the biggest risk is not moving inflation back to target and all of the Fed is in consensus on that view, the trajectory on inflation right now is &amp;quot;in the right direction&amp;quot;, policy is clearly in restrictive territory and the Fed can be patient, would not be comfortable if inflation stalls or expectations rise, right now expectations are pretty well anchored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daly  (Neutral)  2023-7-10 T-11:&lt;/strong&gt; There is more we need to do to raise rates, risks have become more balanced, sees the need for two more rate hikes this year to bring inflation back to 2% goal, the precise number of hikes may be adjusted based on economic data, the risk of underacting continues to outweigh the risk of overacting but these risks are becoming more balanced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mester  (Hawk)  2023-7-10 T-11:&lt;/strong&gt; The Fed will need to tighten somewhat further to lower inflation, no decision yet on the need for a July hike, the outlook for the terminal rate matches or is just above June&amp;#39;s median forecast, there was a preference for a June hike but there&amp;#39;s an understanding as to why there wasn&amp;#39;t any action taken, closer to the end of the tightening campaign than to the start, policy is less restrictive compared to history, raising rates again will reduce the risk of more action in the future, the economy has proven stronger than expected, core inflation remains too high and broad-based, wage pressures remain too high to get inflation back to 2%, business leaders&amp;#39; fears of a recession have declined, too early to say the neutral rate has shifted much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-7-7 T-14:&lt;/strong&gt; Sees 1-2 more rate hikes this year, I haven&amp;#39;t seen anything that says one or two more hikes this year is wrong, still undecided on July hike, I feel like we&amp;#39;re on the golden path to &amp;quot;no recession and the inflation target&amp;quot;, the job market is outstanding, there&amp;#39;s a lag to monetary policy, inflation is down somewhat but needs to come down more,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logan  (Neutral)  2023-7-6 T-15:&lt;/strong&gt; More rate hikes are likely necessary, would have been okay with a June hike, challenging and uncertain environment enabled June pause, very concerned whether inflation will cool quickly enough, skeptical about the lagged impact of past rate hikes, the housing market may have bottomed out, the Fed has room to shrink the balance sheet for quite some time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Williams  (Neutral)  2023-7-5 T-16:&lt;/strong&gt; Slowing down rate rises makes sense right now, future rate rises are still in play, fully supported the Fed&amp;#39;s decision to hold rates steady at the June FOMC, not content with where inflation is right now, open question how fast inflation will cool next year, fighting inflation remains the Fed&amp;#39;s main job, the economy has handled rate hikes &amp;quot;reasonably well&amp;quot;, surprised to see the resilience of the housing market, the economy still has a strong demand for labour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-6-30 T-21:&lt;/strong&gt; There is nothing in the Fed&amp;#39;s mandate about stock prices, I hope the market remains sober, have to see through the market&amp;#39;s ups and downs, have not made up my mind on rates, there is a number of data releases before the next Fed meeting, there is a lag in the impact of interest rates on the economy, hopeful we can get inflation down to target without a recession, the strongest part of the economic data is the labour market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bostic  (Neutral)  2023-6-29 T-22:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#39;t see as much urgency to move as stated by others, nobody should take a signal from my view that we should pause, we&amp;#39;re not seeing inflation moving away from target, comfortable waiting, there are undoubtedly scenarios where we could move at two meetings in a row but not expecting that will happen, will do more if needed, less concerned about high inflation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bostic 2023-6-29 T-22:&lt;/strong&gt; Not ready to rule out further rate hikes if required but does not see need, does not see Fed rate cuts in 2023 or 2024, monetary policy has only recently moved into restrictive territory, effects of monetary policy tightening are starting to show up in the real economy, policy in place to bring inflation back to 2% target, it&amp;#39;s unambiguous that inflation has fallen considerably, inflation is in a gradual cooling trend that should continue, inflation should cool even if Fed leaves current policy in place, expects to reach inflation goal without causing severe downturn.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powell  (Neutral)  2023-6-28 T-23:&lt;/strong&gt; We believe there is more restrictive policy coming, policy hasn&amp;#39;t been restrictive for very long, have not made a decision to hike at every other meeting, would not take moving at consecutive meetings off the table, data over the last quarter has been strong, as we get closer and close to the goal the risks become more balanced, haven&amp;#39;t seen much progress in non-housing services, high labour costs in non-housing services are causing inflationary pressures, need to see more softening in the labour market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Williams  (Neutral)  2023-6-26 T-25:&lt;/strong&gt; Restoring price stability is of &amp;quot;paramount importance&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bostic  (Neutral)  2023-6-23 T-28:&lt;/strong&gt; Expects jobless rate to rise from historically low level, not seeing elements of risk appearing in the economy, credit risk is likely coming and real estate could pose a risk, the banking sector is quite strong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daly  (Neutral)  2023-6-23 T-28:&lt;/strong&gt; Two more rate hikes this year is a &amp;quot;very reasonable&amp;quot; projection, it&amp;#39;s only a projection and we don&amp;#39;t know for sure, prudent to slow the pace of hikes as we approach destination, risks over overtightening and undertightening are about balanced, strongly supported June decision to hold rates and watch the data, credit tightening so far is consistent with what would have been expected without March banking turmoil.&lt;/li&gt;

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2023-09-01.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Upcoming Earnings&lt;/h2&gt;

As part of our retirement package, a number of company shares are given to us (always based on a % of our salary).  This year, we have an opportunity to roll an amount of our choosing into the company ESOP plan.  The last such opportunity was in 2011 (when I first started) so this doesn't happen often.

The company is rapidly growing (currently around 1,500 employees) and is preparing to make the jump into the ""large business"" pool of DoD contractors within the next few years.

The blog covers the legal landscape and regulations overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for options trading in the UK. It explains the role of derivatives, key regulatory bodies, and the requirements for options traders to operate legally and ethically. Additionally, it discusses tax considerations, risks, and protections for traders, making it a must-read for anyone starting or exploring options trading.

I found the tips for navigating the legal landscape particularly useful, along with common legal issues and challenges traders may face. It's evident that the blog aims to educate readers.

Eurozone core inflation accelerated .4% last month which is twice as much as the number in May.

Core consumer prices, stripping out volatile elements like food and energy, rose 5.5% from a year earlier, Eurostat said Wednesday. That was above the estimate of 5.4% and a reading of 5.3% in May.

Headline inflation came also out at 5.5% YoY with 0.3% added last month which was more than May.

ECB chief Lagarde already made clear more rate hikes will come to combat higher consumer prices.

The small minority who are into crypto tend to be (or at least used to be) very loud about it and imo put more people off the idea. Frankly, I'm always shocked at how certain everyone seems to be on both sides of the 'debate'.

I was curious to know if many of you guys actually hold any crypto even as a very small portion of your portfolio? I have my retirement accounts just funnelling into various broad ETFs for the next few decades.

Even if you think crypto is one big scam predicated on the greater fool theory, you have to admit that the returns seen over the last 10 years are nothing short of astronomical. So even if it's just as 'fun money', as a gambling play, or a 'just in case..', do you hold any crypto? 

I don't currently hold any BTC as I've been waiting and watching from the sidelines during the bear market, but I'm thinking about DCAing small amounts in now before the bull market comes back in full force which I believe will be next year. Not got much data to support that, but with Blackrock trying to get their ETF approved, and Coinbase's chances looking pretty positive, it's looking to me like things might be warming up again as the next halving approaches (which I'm lead to believe is typically when bull runs start). The potential collapse of Binance is a big cause for concern though. As the biggest exchange out there (?), the contagion from that in the cryptosphere could be catastrophic.

Is he actually talking about a credit default swap?

It's just that it looks like all Bank CDs are in the range of 4-6% interest generally.

As the saying goes, don’t try picking up Pennie’s in front of a steam roller. Well, surprise, surprise. After close, they announce they will be releasing their earnings tomorrow morning. I couldn’t sell my shares @ $38 when the news broke because then I don’t have level 3 options approval to sell/hold naked calls. I’m down -15%. I could lose 25-40% of my portfolio over this if the price drops to 20-30. A day before I quit my job and travel for 6 months, living off my portfolio…

It looks like my last covered call I impatiently bought is what’s screwing me over right now. Cost basis for all my shares are around $38 assuming calls exp worthless.

&lt;p&gt;I was playing a game of theta farming by buying $41 7/21-7/28 puts and then buying 40-42 (mostly), and 44 (single) covered calls, thus turning my position into a collar. I have slightly more unhedged puts and started getting scared at the end and bought a few put spreads. Where I went wrong was selling 37-38p exp this week to pick up $100-$120 each thinking $Cvna will hold at $36. I expected this week to hold up and next week for everything to drop due to Fed meeting. I was always going to close everything this Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

\*I don't own any stocks of Zim yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I see that ZIM had an excellent dividend payout the last few quarters, but now they've lost revenue and have cancelled dividend payouts in the forseeable future.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand the shipping industry, but it has something to do with the company being too exposed to the spot market rather than the contracts market and that has contributed to their last quarter revenue. I'm sure someone who understands the industry better could explain it to me like I'm a baby.

&amp;#x200B;

Management has said that they are expecting that the 13 brand new ships they've purchased should help them generate new revenue. I am not sure how having more ships would help them generate more cash flow if their problem by the sounds of it seems to be lower ship rates.
