Could someone explain me why is Exxon mobil in the 10th place of the Dow Jones Global index with:

market cap of ~450b

 ~50% of free float

While Eli lilly and company:

market cap of ~500b

~100% of free float

Is outside the top 10? (Factsheet: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/dow-jones-global-index/#overview)

I know the rebalancing of this index is once per year in september and that LLY climb way faster than Exxon this year, however since it is float market cap weighted it should still be before Exxon no?

It also seems like the other global index puts LLY before Exxon so I guess there is an issue.

Did the just forget to update the top 10 ranking and also makes it only once a year?

Here's market moving TMT news this morning:  
  
\*\*$PINS JPM out positive on August data....August download growth inflected &amp; PINS has seen notable QTD acceleration in Ad Manager visits, UVs, &amp; time spent, which could be an encouraging sign. Download growth inflected to +15% Y/Y in August from +7% Y/Y in July against roughly similar Y/Y comps, while overall MAUs, DAUs, &amp; time spent trends have remained stable. PINS Ad Manager, however, has seen strong QTD acceleration in visits (+35% Y/Y), UVs (+30%), time spent (+18%).  
  
\*\*$DIS - Mark Schilsky at Bernstein lays out Bull case for $DIS in his morning note saying we may be at the bottom of OP margin on 1) higher prices driving significant incremental operating margins and 2) Hulut synergies:  
\- """"All told, these future price increases should increase annual DTC segment revenues by \~$2.4B at nearly 100% incremental margins (assuming minimal impact on churn, which you shouldn’t assume is a given).  That’s notable because the DTC Segment’s run-rate OI loss based on FYQ323 figures is -$2.4B.  Is it a stretch to say that Disney’s DTC segment could be generating positive annualized OI in early CY 2024?  I don’t think so.  (-$2.4B annualized loss + $2.4B in 100% incremental margin price increases = OI &gt; 0, hopefully).  That’s notable because 1) it would drastically change the narrative around the stock (‘streaming isn’t profitable’) and 2) Consensus currently estimates the DTC segment won’t achieve this level of OI run-rate until FYQ424.""  
\- ""All told, I estimate there is a plausible scenario in which Disney’s DTC segment is generating $2B+ in OI in FY25 (Consensus is at \~$1B).  That’s a decent-sized OI uplift when compared with Consensus of \~$17B in FY25E OI, which I doubt many investors believe is in the realm of possibility with the stock at \~$82.  Sure, you need Parks OI to continue to chug along to remain constructive on the stock, but I think most investors remain skeptical on Disney’s ability to generate significant OI from the streaming business which I think is imminent.""  
\- From a consumer standpoint, Disney+ will be a much better app by year end when Hulu content will be integrated directly into the user interface in the United States.  It will be analogous to how Star is offered to consumers in Europe (see my future Disney+ UI ‘render’ below).  Integrating general entertainment content directly into the app should reduce subscriber churn and help Disney+ better compete with Netflix, which has always enjoyed a unified app experience.   ""  
  
TMT Breakout: Mark's notes can sometimes moves stocks (see his last $NFLX pricing note) and he lays out a detailed $DIS bull case in his morning note. I normally would think this would be a good day long on this note but we had WBD come out and negatively pre-announce so tougher to call which way the stock is going to move.  
  
\*\*AAPL Bofa neg on Huawei phone and Bernstein out with note comparing it to IBM 10 years ago - Bofa out slightly neg as they call out new Huawei phone that finally launched with a new chip and comparable 5g speeds after sanctions held them back in 2019....Huawei has historically had #1 share in China at 12.3% VS $AAPL at 7.9%. AAPL has gained 30M units in share since the sanctions began.  Huawei share has gone down to 3.1% since the sanctions. BofA saying every 10M units shift to Huawei would cause 11c headwind to Fy24 EPS.    
Bernstein out with a note saying lots of similarities between $AAPL and $IBM 10 years ago  
  
TMT Breakout: First time I have seen this called out on the sell side and frankly the the amount of $AAPL share that they have won from Huawei surprised me and the potential impact to EPS is big -- let's say 15c --&gt; 20x that is $3 so stock could be down 1.5%.  Stock is down 90bps in pre market.   Bernstein note adds fuel to the fire, although I think the argument is kind of silly  
  
\*\*$DPZ - Upgraded to Buy at Cowen....TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles upgraded Domino's Pizza (DPZ) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $450, up from $420. The firm forecasts the ""enticing"" U.S. sales narrative from the Uber (UBER) partnership and self- help initiatives to drive positive sales revisions and organic EPS beats, while arguing that potential downside is limited by opportunities to sign new delivery partners once Uber's exclusivity expires at the end of 2024, the analyst tells investors.  
TMT Breakout: Solid upgrade here and stock only up 1.25% pre market.  I think should finish up close to 2%  
  
\*\*$ORCL -upgraded to Buy at Barclays. I like this upgrade, more detail below:  
Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow upgraded Oracle to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $150, up from $126. ""The past few years has seen ORCL growth inflect higher, and we believe these levels can be maintained in the out years as the positive mix effect still has a long way to go. Driving this is ORCL's move into the cloud, with Fusion, NetSuite, and OCI gaining share within the ORCL portfolio, but these combined business lines are still less than 25% of total revenue. Hence, we believe there is still ample room to go from here. We also think OCI is positioned favorably for AI workloads given their close relationship with Nvidia and being one of the 1st CSPs to come to market with Nvidia's SaaS products (see: rAImo’s AI Series - Vol 1: Software With a Side of Chips, 9/5/2023). As such, we think there is enough for investor interest to continue, and with valuation still only at \~20x CY24E P/E, we upgrade to OW.Oracle a ""multi-year growth story.""...""As we can see in the graph below, the simple truth is that the higher growing areas of Oracle are taking over a larger part of the overall revenue, and hence driving up the overall growth rate of the company. ""  
  
  
However, what is more important is the trajectory Oracle is demonstrating, and here we can see that the company is not too dissimilar to the other main players at similar scale. The graph below shows the trajectory for when other vendors hit around the $2bn run-rate mark.   
  
  
""Next, it is easy to dismiss the opportunity and argue ""the story is done"". However, the new growth areas are only about 25% of the total portfolio and hence there is a lot more room to go. As we argue above, there are also a lot of drivers to continue to fuel growth for the SaaS and the OCI portfolio. Therefore, we are looking at a multi-year story here.  
  
Next, this is not the first time that such a cloud story has played out in software. In the graph below we show the evolution of Microsoft's valuation multiple. We can see the clear uptick in multiple once Azure, MSFT's cloud offering, hit critical scale (around $2bn run-rate).For Oracle we believe we are at a similar cross-over. We argue that Oracle's multiple will continue to expand as investors will want to own this multi-year growth acceleration story. We see the company's multiple continuing to run ahead of earnings as investors understand the cloud dynamics better. Looking at Oracle's valuation graph below shows that we have started to see the beginning of the uptick but comparing this to MSFT shows that there remains ample opportunity for more expansion.""

TMT Breakout: This comes on the back of UBS upgrade last week, and I like the comparison charts to other hyperscalers at the same point in their cycle.....still seems like there is plenty of room to re-rate on the stock as still trades at 20x next years p/e.  Think it probably continues to grind higher from here and could see new highs on this upgrade.  
  
$META - Considering paid instagram in Europe and BofA positive on Sensor Tower Data  
From Mark at bernstein: ""As for how much META may charge…according to the META Q223 Earnings Presentation, Europe ARPU averaged a bit over $16 on a trailing twelve month basis which means that for these users to be revenue neutral would require a monthly subscription fee of \~$5.25 (€4.85).  But, keep in mind that META’s ARPU number is ‘fake’ in that it only accounts for Facebook Blue users, so the real ARPU, inclusive of Instagram users, is decidedly less by some non-trivial amount. Are ad-free versions of Facebook &amp; Instagram worth $5 per month (or less) to the average European? Or would they rather just opt-in to the personalized ad experience that META has been providing for nearly 20 years?  Assuming this paid/free scheme is rolled out in the EU, I would expect the VAST majority of users to opt-in to the free ad-supported version. ""  
  
$BABA and AliCloud IPO - MS out with a note saying they value BABA’s cloud business at c.US$55bn, by applying 3x P/S (in line with what we use for Tencent Cloud, and a discount to the 5x revenue multiple our US analyst Brian Nowak uses for AWS). Potential capital injection from SOEs could help AliCloud broaden customer base and solidify its leading position as No.1 hyperscaler in the country. We will monitor further updates on any progress on other assets with IPO/capital raising plans, which could be positive catalysts for BABA's stock price, in our view:  
  
$ABNB - set to join S&amp;P...stock trading up 6%  
  
$NTAP - Upgraded to Buy at Susq:  
""Looking forward, the recovery in Product Rev is expected to gain momentum in 2024 as trained models that are currently in the public cloud migrate to on-prem/Edge for inferencing due to increased security/compliance/IP requirements. This is expected to drive incremental demand for SAN-specific Object Storage.

$TSLA slightly down mkt after being down 5% on Friday on a sell the news reaction to the new Model 3 refresh + pricing cuts. I continue to like it here as I think pricing cuts are v. compelling, model 3 refresh looks good, and auto strike at the big 3 heading into Sept 14th could help sentiment  
  
$TCOM, one of largest booking firms in China, reported strong Q2 results, as demand for leisure contineus to recovery robustly (mgmt on the earnings call talks about a shift in consumer spending away from goods and into services, a pattern that echoes what happened in the US over the last several years).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relatively quiet morning with QQQs down 20bps, yields up slightly, FXI dn 90bps....In tech investors focused on GS TMT conf where $WBD already neg pre-announced ahead of it.

The number was pretty shocking especially since it doesn't feel like I live all that extravagantly.   I've always planned to retire at age 45 or 50 or whatever (but I'll truthfully, I'll probably never retire, just start a new business and keep the mind strong) and my goal has always been $~~4~~ 5m in the stock portfolio so I can live on 4% of it which is $200,000 per year.  That seems reasonable, comfortable, and feasible especially if houses are paid off and college tuition is already put aside.

&amp;#x200B;

Well my buddy said, ""no, no, in 10 years your $200,000 spend per year is going to actually become $400,000 because the dollar will be worth way less! You actually need $10m to retire and keep your standard of living the same.""

My thought was, well I'm not saving cash that is weakening and losing to inflation, I'm owning stocks (mostly high growth stocks that trends along the DASDAQ).  Therefore every 10 years my portfolio will double historically if not more (we are currently at 283% on the 10 year coming off a massive low from Nov 2021 factored in).  So yes, my purchasing power might drop in 10 years and I need $400,000 to live the same way as $200,000 buys today but my portfolio will grow to match that if not exceed it especially if I'm only removing 4% each year and not the 6-10% it might grow on average.

What is the consensus here and who is thinking about this the right way?  Obviously being conservative and working harder to get that $10m nest egg is always the smartest option but is my train of thought flawed and I just don't understand something?

25,investing,"Hi all, here's a recap of all things TMT

&amp;#x200B;

What happened this week in TMT:  
  
Lots of interesting news and movers in TMT this week.  Overall, very good week for Tech with QQQs up 4% and ARKK up 6.5%. We saw some weakness in large-cap tech on Friday as growthier names played catch up and now ARKK YTD (up 40%) barely trades QQQ YTD (up 42%).   
  
  
$DELL absolutely crushed earnings - stock opened up 7% on Friday and finished up 21% with its biggest move in over a decade as stock is being re-rated for several reasons, including being an AI play.  MS laid out clearly in their note: ""With signs of hardware spend stabilizing, AI server emerging as a driver of revenue/profit upside, stepped-up capital return commitments and S&amp;P inclusion still ahead of us, and solid execution/cost mgmt driving profitability upside, we are moving DELL to our Top IT Hardware Pick, with new $70 price target."" This is another data point that confirms PC market rebound many have been harping on about.  $DELL called out faster than expected demand improvement driven by US and EMEA.  MS saying their checks showing 15-25k AI servers being built in 23+24 (or $5B), means street estimates at $2B of server revenue in FY25 look way too low.  We are looking at potentially $7+ earnings power in CY24 and $8+ in CY25. With top line and eps inflecting positive this year, we think 10x is too low. Their AI server story + PC refresh are two very powerful narratives that should continue to drive a re-rating higher (despite it trading at higher end of its range), especially with $DELL being one of the few companies already showing meaningful signs of positive benefit from AI.  Right tail optionality from AI at the edge driving PC refresh cycle down the line.  Laterals: $HPE, $IBM, $HPQ, $INTC, $AMD  
  
Media names were demolished on Friday as $CHTR and $DIS continue their fight - $WBD down 12%, $PARA down 10%, $FOX down 6%.  Key quote from CHTR presentation: ""We have already reached the point of economic indifference with the current model...We are at a crossroads that requires us to either: Create a new path to a new economic and distribution model, or largely exit the traditional video business.""  
  
Software back in vogue... Strong week in software as we had good reports from $NTNX, $ESTC, $S, $MDB, $VEEV, $OKTA, $CRWD and $CRM. Reading through the transcripts, it seems software spend is on the mend heading into the 2H of the year - we should hear more datapts this week from the companies at Citi and GS TMT conferences.  
  
$SHOP/$AMZN....Big move from $SHOP on Thursday as they announced they came to an agreement with $AMZN around Buy with Prime - this had been an overhang on the stock and not only was it lifted but the new agreement provided new incremental positives for $SHOP particularly merchants can still use $SHOP payments.  The integration allows $SHOP merchants to offer Buy with Prime on $SHOP stores, simplyfying the merchants' experience, automatically synching orders, promotions, etc.  Prime members get the benefit of access to fast delivery and free returns through $AMZN.  MS think every 10% penetration of SHOP US GMV will add 1% to '25 $AMZN EBIT and thinks this integration is one step of a large ideas $AMZN has: ""Stepping back, AMZN's efforts to extend its logistics network into non-$AMZN volumes and monetize incremental purchasing behavior will only further its ability to improve its logistics offerings and drive incremental throughput efficiencies. Additionally, further share capture of non-$AMZN retail volumes (via Buy with Prime integrations) increases AMZN's access to unique consumer purchase data. We believe both of these factors, (unique physical infrastructure and consumer data) will be key in building capabilities like a next-gen personal shopping assistant""...for $SHOP: The standard Shopify partner agreement charges partners 15% of revenue &gt;$1 million, but we believe Amazon was likely able to negotiate this down to \~5-10% as a concession for allowing Shopify to retain control of Checkout/Payments. Assuming a Shopify app store fee in the range of 5-10% on Buy With Prime revenues and 10% penetration of Shopify 2025 US order volumes, we assume this could add \~$150-300 million (1-3%) to FY25 Shopify revenue (high margin, largely pass-through economics.""  
  
$INTC had a strong week and chart looks like it wants to breakout on the back of CEO talking up early FAB customers + $DELL comments on PC refresh. MS also put out some positive pricing commentary on $WDC for NAND and Mizuho called out more Samsung DRAM cuts benefitting $MU.  These are the better names in Semis, while AI-exposed stuff is taking a breather after $AVGO's inline-ish report while analogs doing the worst out of the bunch on recent commentary from $ADI and $MCHP.  If PC names going up, maybe we get another leg higher for $AMD, which should also benefit if AI Semi names reverse this last week's lagging. Other laterals: $LOGI, $CDW  
   
China internet had a nice bounce lead by $PDD.  If $PDD isn't on your radar, get it on there...Temu(which $PDD owns)  is getting more interest from investors and Bernstein wrote a good note detailing the rise of Temu's market share and increasing traction into the U.S. :""Our two most important takeaways from recent channel checks include (1) very high user retention and repeat purchase rates on Temu — higher than Shein, and within touching distance of Amazon; (2) the realisation that Temu has more or less achieved variable breakeven among US repeat buyers, after the first handful of orders....Google Trends data pointed to Temu recently overtaking Etsy in terms of public awareness, and approaching Shein levels... Compared with average order value of US$35 across the platform, and lower outside the US, industry contacts we spoke with pointed to AOV north of US$40 among repeat shoppers..., we show the implied multiple on PDD's domestic business assuming Temu is valued between zero (the bull case among onshore believers) and negative US$20bn. This range implies 13-15x domestic PE in 2023E, but just 11-12x 2024E on our above-consensus estimate..""    
  
I personally liked $TSLA's Model 3 refresh and am just amazed how low Model S, Model 3, and Model X prices have gotten.  Hard to deny TSLA is the best value in the car market right now across the board. You can get a car that goes 0-60 in 2s for $86K w 400mile range (Model S Plaid)! I still love the sound of a straight 6, but as an overall car lover, I love it! If this new new model 3 refresh + price cuts + if Elon gets AI self-driving right, then I think the narrative strongly favors the bulls.  
  
  
What TMT Investors are focused on this upcoming week:  
  
Main thing everyone will be paying attention to is the Citi and GS TMT conferences. Remember that if you don't have a bloomberg or relationship with Citi/GS, the streaming link for mostof these can be found on the company's IR pages.   
From GS: ""Broadly, we expect investors to be focused on three key themes into and out of the conference: 1) consumer/enterprise end demand trends given the current shifting macroeconomic environment; 2) resource allocation (opex/capex) against key growth initiatives for 2024 and beyond as a balance of growth and margin expansion is achieved into the next fiscal year; and 3) how shifting/changing compute platforms might impact business models over the short to long term (AI, mature mobile computing trends, automation of labor, robotoaxis, metaverse/augmented reality etc.)...As an output of those debates (&amp; how companies might frame the narratives heading into 2H 2023 &amp; FY 24), we still find that many investors now have a much more mixed view of recession probabilities (especially when compared with a year ago) but that most investors (based on our conversations in the past 4-6 weeks) still remain much more defensive than offensive in nature with respect to the industry (even despite some of the rising medium/long term narratives around AI as a leading force for computing shifts in the coming years).""    
  
Here are the schedules:  
  
GS Internet:  
  
Citi:  
  
  
Earnings calendar next week:  
  
\* Tue (9/5): Post: ASAN, GTLB, ZS;

MS also put out some positive pricing commentary on $WDC for NAND and Mizuho called out more Samsung DRAM cuts benefitting $MU.  These are the better names in Semis, while AI-exposed stuff is taking a breather after $AVGO&amp;#39;s inline-ish report while analogs doing the worst out of the bunch on recent commentary from $ADI and $MCHP.  If PC names going up, maybe we get another leg higher for $AMD, which should also benefit if AI Semi names reverse this last week&amp;#39;s lagging. Other laterals: $LOGI, $CDW&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China internet had a nice bounce lead by $PDD.  If $PDD isn&amp;#39;t on your radar, get it on there...Temu(which $PDD owns)  is getting more interest from investors and Bernstein wrote a good note detailing the rise of Temu&amp;#39;s market share and increasing traction into the U.S. :&amp;quot;Our two most important takeaways from recent channel checks include (1) very high user retention and repeat purchase rates on Temu — higher than Shein, and within touching distance of Amazon; (2) the realisation that Temu has more or less achieved variable breakeven among US repeat buyers, after the first handful of orders....Google Trends data pointed to Temu recently overtaking Etsy in terms of public awareness, and approaching Shein levels... Compared with average order value of US$35 across the platform, and lower outside the US, industry contacts we spoke with pointed to AOV north of US$40 among repeat shoppers..., we show the implied multiple on PDD&amp;#39;s domestic business assuming Temu is valued between zero (the bull case among onshore believers) and negative US$20bn. This range implies 13-15x domestic PE in 2023E, but just 11-12x 2024E on our above-consensus estimate..&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally liked $TSLA&amp;#39;s Model 3 refresh and am just amazed how low Model S, Model 3, and Model X prices have gotten.  Hard to deny TSLA is the best value in the car market right now across the board. You can get a car that goes 0-60 in 2s for $86K w 400mile range (Model S Plaid)! I still love the sound of a straight 6, but as an overall car lover, I love it! If this new new model 3 refresh + price cuts + if Elon gets AI self-driving right, then I think the narrative strongly favors the bulls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What TMT Investors are focused on this upcoming week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main thing everyone will be paying attention to is the Citi and GS TMT conferences. Remember that if you don&amp;#39;t have a bloomberg or relationship with Citi/GS, the streaming link for mostof these can be found on the company&amp;#39;s IR pages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From GS: &amp;quot;Broadly, we expect investors to be focused on three key themes into and out of the conference: 1) consumer/enterprise end demand trends given the current shifting macroeconomic environment; 2) resource allocation (opex/capex) against key growth initiatives for 2024 and beyond as a balance of growth and margin expansion is achieved into the next fiscal year; and 3) how shifting/changing compute platforms might impact business models over the short to long term (AI, mature mobile computing trends, automation of labor, robotoaxis, metaverse/augmented reality etc.)...As an output of those debates (&amp;amp; how companies might frame the narratives heading into 2H 2023 &amp;amp; FY 24), we still find that many investors now have a much more mixed view of recession probabilities (especially when compared with a year ago) but that most investors (based on our conversations in the past 4-6 weeks) still remain much more defensive than offensive in nature with respect to the industry (even despite some of the rising medium/long term narratives around AI as a leading force for computing shifts in the coming years).&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the schedules:&lt;/p&gt;

28,investing,"Hello all,

(TL;DR - income down and uncertain in the short term, big home improvement project coming up, way more money in stocks than savings. Need to tap into equities but unsure which ones would be best. Also seeking restructure/optimization advice on portfolio.)

Recent dip in income, trying to change careers, housing projects coming due - running into a situation where I think it would be more beneficial to liquidate shares and park in a high yield savings acct for less volatility with all the uncertainty in my short term future. Would love advice on which stocks/ETFs y'all think I should sell off or just general advice on my situation. 

Assets: currently ~$7k in checking/savings with upcoming deposit of $14k landing in the next few weeks. Bank offers 2% APY and I know I can get better returns elsewhere, just haven't really bothered as I keep most of my ""long-term"" money in stocks.

Income: TBD. Mortgage loan officer and times are tough. Followed a college to a new job with promises of greener grass but it isn't looking good. Pursuing career change for more stability. May take a few months+ for earnings to align with my target again. Wife works salary job @ $90k/yr.

Expenses: $2k/mo for my half of mtg + utilities + personal loan, $150 car payment. Round everything up and I'm probably $3k - $3,500/mo depending on how much fun I want to have on him weekends. 

Sitting on a $20k loan for the home project that I'm splitting payments on with the wife. Estimating another ~$10k+ on top for total project completion that will most likely come out of my pocket. Rate is 13.49%. Once the dust settles on the project plan is to pay it off aggressively depending on income. Got the loan as wife doesn't have full cash on hand and I'd rather have a slow trickle from my account rater than large lump sum payout. 

Got Robinhood in 2020 and quickly realized I have no idea what I'm really doing. Most of my money  is in ETFs but I think there's a fair amount of redundancy in my holdings and I'd probably benefit from consolidating. Some accounts are positive, some negative. Had to pay taxes last year but don't really anticipate that being the case for 2023.

I'm 28 so retirement is a far off horizon. Already maxing IRA and 401k so I consider my stocks to be more of a ""reserve"" account, ideally for long term growth but also access to additional funds if needed. Biggest fear I guess would be income stays low for a while while I figure things out, market tanks, now I'm selling stocks for pennies on the dollar to get by.

My thoughts/plan:

Sell off DAL, C, NDAQ, TAN, ICLN, &amp; SCHD for a total of $9,153 and net loss of $289. This should cover most of the additional housing expenses and minimize losses.

But what would you do from there, especially if I'm anticipating a big reduction in income for the next 6 months?  Been considering selling everything besides (V)ETFs and then shaving off additional equity as needed but idk if that would be most prudent.

Also if I would short just the bear fund, I would have over a 1300% drawdown (based on dust etf) which would be too large to warrant using much of my exliq plus the borrow costs would go insane.

 Here are the criteria needed:

* relatively low drawdown (can use low amount of exliq if relative drawdown is high)
* non market-correlated

For those not in the know TSM fabs like 50% of apple chips, all NVDA chips. They are the most sophisticated chip fabrication plant on the globe. 

TSM is hanging right around the bottom of the channel of the uptrend. 

now this is a solid company, solid financials, 2% annual dividend, diversifying into arizona (with struggles) and germany (with both comes a lesser ability to produce chips than the main Taiwan factory), which removes **some** of the risk of being solely in Taiwan. Maybe a japan factory as well?

If you bought around 93-92 dollars, set a stop loss at say 87 or 86 being a significant break in trend, or maybe even as low as 84 or 83, a real break in the trend, you would lose somewhere between 6.5% to 10%. 

now if TSM continues the uptrend and we go to 100 you are up 7.5%

if we go to 105 youre up 12.9%

if TSM suprasses a high on its trip down in 2022 around 109 to hit 110, you're up 18.2%

and it just continues up from there, i mean you hit 115 and the risk reward is totally worth it. So you're a long term holder buying into the bottom of the uptrend and setting a stop loss around 88-87, 5-6% risk to make maybe 20% on the high upside, maybe 12.9-7.5 on the lowside. 

its a decent bet. 

full disclosure i think hanging around the bottom of the trend shows a little uncertainty but it also is opportunity for you. i bought days ago.

&lt;p&gt;now this is a solid company, solid financials, 2% annual dividend, diversifying into arizona (with struggles) and germany (with both comes a lesser ability to produce chips than the main Taiwan factory), which removes &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; of the risk of being solely in Taiwan.

I bought a condo last week, all cash (basically our landlady told us to leave, and we were sick of getting kicked around from place to place, so just decided to buy the damn thing).

Now of course this comes with massive duration risk, meaning that the nominal value of these bonds will plunge if interest rates were to rise.

A bit of background: I'm 27 years old, living in one of the European countries, and I've been involved in stock market investments for more than 3 years now. I started with stock picking, and it just so happened that during the COVID crisis in 2020, I bought quite a few stocks (most of them are from S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats) and other wide ETFs during the downturn. I continued to delve into the topic of investments, studied literature and some stuff, and realized that the stock-picking is not that I want to solely follow. The strategy that suits me is just a long-term investment in the broad market (FTSE All-World / MSCI World) to secure a stable passive income by the age of 45-50 and have a comfortable retirement. I've come to the conclusion that in my case, Irish accumulating ETFs are the most advantageous way, allowing me to defer tax payment until withdrawing the money and not pay taxes upon dividend receipt.  


The question here is that intellectually, I understand that it's more profitable for me to invest in Irish ETFs that accumulate dividends and don't pay them directly into my account but reinvest them in buying more stocks. However, I enjoy the fact of receiving dividends in my account, right when they come in and I get notifications, seeing the statistics. It seems to give me a certain sense of confidence, and it's just nice to see those income streams.  


Since I was about 19, I've enjoyed playing incremental, accumulating games (like idle/clickers) where I can see the results of my actions and how some characteristic accumulates. I mean, I liked compound interest in games, particularly the behavior of ""invested - received more soon."" It seems to stem from my childhood, perhaps some personality trait or something that influenced me - I'm not sure.

Take for example [Fidelity SPAXX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/performance-and-risk/31617H102?type=sq-NavBar). You can see a lot of yield info **relative to today**:

* 7-day yield 4.98%
* 1 year return 4.05%
* 3 year return 1.45%
* etc.

But what I can NOT find are the yields stated in an absolute way that's not relative to today. For example:

* 7-day yield as of 9/1/23
* 7-day yield as of 8/1/23
* 7-day yield as of 7/1/23
* 7-day yield as of 6/1/23

One can find graphs of stock prices **over time** all over the net. But I'm just now realizing you can't find yield prices over time hardly anywhere. (You can find it for really big things like U.S. Govt historical dividend yields. But not individual investments.)

I bought a large chunk of shares a year ago, after the war broke out, as I anticipated the business would survive. Actually, the business is quite well, all things considered.

The issue is with current majority holder, oligarch Verevsky and his fund Namsen. His goal is to take advantage of the war prices and gather full ownership of the company.

84,investing,"Dear fellow investors, and fellow participants,

I'd like to share some insights into my investment journey. In January 2022, I embarked on my investment voyage, adopting a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) approach with monthly contributions into IWDA. In February, I deviated slightly from this pattern, making a lump sum investment equivalent to five months' worth of contributions, but then resumed the regular DCA strategy. Throughout this journey, I've maintained a long-term perspective and remained unfazed by temporary losses or seeing my portfolio in the red.

In 2023, I decided to diversify my holdings further by investing in four individual stocks, allocating funds equivalent to three months' worth of expenses to each. I successfully executed this strategy, and at present, I've deployed roughly one-third of my capital, while two-thirds remain in cash.

However, the cash portion of my portfolio is currently parked in a savings account. Regrettably, in the world of Europoor banking. While this cash provides a sense of security, it's not doing much in terms of growing my wealth.

**The rationale behind maintaining a significant cash position is tied to my mortgage, which is due for a rate adjustment in approximately three years and a few months. Currently, I enjoy a favorable interest rate of just 1.7%. While I'm prepared for the possibility of higher rates, I prefer to have a cushion of funds readily available to handle any potential increases. This financial safety net, which comprises the two-thirds of my cash holdings, serves as a precautionary measure to ensure I can comfortably address any future rate adjustments.**

**Of course, I'll continue to generate income, save, and invest during this period, further bolstering my financial position. Consequently, my query is twofold: Where should I consider placing this (for me substantial) cash reserve, and should I be open to slightly more aggressive investment options given my longer time horizon, recognizing that I won't require these funds in the immediate three-year window?**

Your insights and advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

104,investing,"A  big challenge with long-term buy-and-hold in index funds is that many people have trouble sticking with the strategy through bad times - even though they know they should stick to it - and sell.  

Here is what I have found works for me as a psychological trick:  I track my portfolios in Mint, but do so manually (no auto-updates).  I track them as an ""asset"" or ""cash"" with a fixed number I manually input.  So the number only changes when I change the number.  And my rule is that those numbers only ever stay the same or go up (as a portfolio increases), never down (in bad times), because I am not going to realize losses and will eventually recover over the decades.  The losses aren't real because they aren't realized.  I have found this makes it much easier to ignore losses - because Mint tells me that if I don't sell, I'll return to a given number XXXXX if I just stick it out and wait to bounce back.

Example:  Portfolio of index funds starts valued at $100,000.  Market downturn takes its value down to $75,000, but I keep it set at $100,000 in Mint.  Market eventually recovers to $105,000, and I add that value into Mint at that time.

Note that this approach DOES still punish you a bit during a downturn:  Let's suppose that during the downturn to $75,000, I deposit $5,000 a month from my checking account into my index fund portfolio.  That money effectively ""disappears"" from Mint, because it decreases the value of my checking account and does not increase the value of my portfolio in Mint.  (It just increases the holdings in my real portfolio, which remain below the $100,000 value in Mint.)   

In some ways, this is like a poor-man's version of a hedge fund:  It doesn't actually hedge market risk (a real hedge [usually](https://youtube.com/watch?v=DZ2QZg_1pHQ&amp;t=387s&amp;ab_channel=HowMoneyWorks) costs you returns), but it psychologically makes you feel like you are hedged against market risk and makes it less psychologically painful to buy-and-hold through a downturn, because the set $100,000 is basically a representation of your anticipated recovery if you hold.

 Another benefit is that it makes you feel like you are making ""progress"" toward your financial goals:  Even if my portfolio is down over an entire year, if I am gaining a bit in cash, or real estate, or whatever else in Mint, it reflects my net worth increasing over time, which provides another big psychological boost.

In short, this is just a psychological strategy, not an investment strategy.  But if it makes it psychologically easier for some people to actually execute on their intended investment strategy of long-term buy-and-hold in index funds, it could provide better returns.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A  big challenge with long-term buy-and-hold in index funds is that many people have trouble sticking with the strategy through bad times - even though they know they should stick to it - and sell.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:  Portfolio of index funds starts valued at $100,000.  Market downturn takes its value down to $75,000, but I keep it set at $100,000 in Mint.  Market eventually recovers to $105,000, and I add that value into Mint at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this approach DOES still punish you a bit during a downturn:  Let&amp;#39;s suppose that during the downturn to $75,000, I deposit $5,000 a month from my checking account into my index fund portfolio.  That money effectively &amp;quot;disappears&amp;quot; from Mint, because it decreases the value of my checking account and does not increase the value of my portfolio in Mint.  (It just increases the holdings in my real portfolio, which remain below the $100,000 value in Mint.)   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this is like a poor-man&amp;#39;s version of a hedge fund:  It doesn&amp;#39;t actually hedge market risk (a real hedge &lt;a href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=DZ2QZg_1pHQ&amp;amp;t=387s&amp;amp;ab_channel=HowMoneyWorks""&gt;usually&lt;/a&gt; costs you returns), but it psychologically makes you feel like you are hedged against market risk and makes it less psychologically painful to buy-and-hold through a downturn, because the set $100,000 is basically a representation of your anticipated recovery if you hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is that it makes you feel like you are making &amp;quot;progress&amp;quot; toward your financial goals:  Even if my portfolio is down over an entire year, if I am gaining a bit in cash, or real estate, or whatever else in Mint, it reflects my net worth increasing over time, which provides another big psychological boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, this is just a psychological strategy, not an investment strategy.  But if it makes it psychologically easier for some people to actually execute on their intended investment strategy of long-term buy-and-hold in index funds, it could provide better returns.&lt;/p&gt;

Both have about the same amount of funds but I am trying to simplify. I've looked into transferring funds from acorns to fidelity so I have more direct control, but the fees associated with it are pretty high. So I could sell the funds to get liquid capital to invest into my fidelity account, however, I'll end up paying the taxes on the profits.

Because that account is much longer running. It also has currently a higher rate of return (about 12%)

So on one hand I just want to consolidate and be done with it, however, because of the lower average cost on that account, I feel my returns will be greater over time if I just keep the money and that account.

I dont want to buy individual stocks since im really bad at that and already wasted so much doing that therefore this time im going all in ETFs

After some research I decided to stick to QQQM for high growth, SCHD for steady groth and decent dividends, VOO for more exposure 

I did some tests on portfolio visualizer and seems like 70% SCHD 20% qqqm 10% VOO not so bad

2012 to 2023
$5000 starting plus $1500 monthly

Schd alone 492k
70% schd 20% qqqm 10% voo 548k
50% schd other two 25% each 564k

192,investing,"A debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan is a loan that is made to a company that is in bankruptcy. The loan is used to provide the company with the money it needs to continue operating during the bankruptcy process.

In recent years, DIP loans have become increasingly complex. They are often tied to other transactions, such as rights offerings and backstop fees. This can give the DIP lender significant control over the reorganization plan process.

The research paper ""Standardizing and Unbundling the Sub Rosa DIP Loan"" by Kenneth Ayotte of UC Berkeley School of Law examines the problem of sub rosa DIP loans. A sub rosa DIP loan is a DIP loan that is used to effectively predetermine the terms of the reorganization plan.

The paper argues that sub rosa DIP loans can harm the interests of other creditors. It proposes two solutions to the problem:

1. Standardizing the terms of DIP loans. This would make it more difficult for DIP lenders to use their control over the loan to extract favorable terms in the reorganization plan.

2. Unbundling the terms of DIP loans. This would separate the loan from other transactions, such as rights offerings and backstop fees. This would make it easier for other creditors to assess the value of the loan and to negotiate with the DIP lender.

Constellation Software, Inc. &gt; &gt; CONSTELLATION SOFTWARE INC. DECLARES DIVIDEND AND FILES FINAL PROSPECTUS IN RELATION TO PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED RIGHTS OFFERING OF SERIES 1 DEBENTURES  
Toronto, Ontario – August 23, 2023 – Constellation Software Inc. (TSX: CSU) (the “Company”)  
announced today that it has declared a special dividend (the “Rights Dividend”) pursuant to which  
all common shareholders (the “Shareholders”) of record as of the close of business on September 1,  
2023 (the “Record Date”) will be entitled to receive, by way of a dividend-in-kind, one right of the  
Company (each, a “Right”) for each common share of the Company (the “Common Shares”) held.  
This dividend has been designated as an eligible dividend for purposes of the Income Tax Act  
(Canada) and any similar provincial and territorial legislation.  
The Company also announced that it hasfiled a final short form prospectus (the “Final Prospectus”)  
in relation to its previously announced rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) pursuant to which the  
Company will issue the Rights in satisfaction of the Rights Dividend that will entitle the  
Shareholders to purchase up to C$700 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured subordinated  
floating rate debentures, Series 1 of the Company (the “Series 1 Debentures”).  
The Series 1 Debentures will be issued as an additional tranche of, and will form a single series with,  
the outstanding C$282.2 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured subordinated floating rate  
debentures, Series 1 of the Company. There is no minimum principal amount of Debentures that  
must be issuable upon the exercise of Rights.  
The net proceeds of the Rights Offering are expected to be used by the Company to pay down  
indebtedness under its existing credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), with any remaining proceeds  
to be used for future acquisitions.  
The Rights will be issued in satisfaction of the Rights Dividend in the amount of one Right per  
Common Share. For every 3.03 Rights held, the holder of such Rights will be entitled to subscribe  
for C$100 principal amount of Series 1 Debentures. The Rights and the Series 1 Debentures will be  
qualified for distribution in each province and territory of Canada by way of the Final Prospectus  
and the Debentures have been registered in the United States on Form F-7 under the United States  
Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  
The Series 1 Debentures are expected to be issued on October 6, 2023 (the “Issue Date”) and will  
have the same terms and conditions as the currently outstanding unsecured subordinated floating rate  
debentures, Series 1 of the Company.  
The Series 1 Debentures have a maturity date of March 31, 2040 (the “Maturity Date”). The Series  
1 Debentures will be issuable only in denominations of C$100 and integral multiples thereof and,  
from and including the Issue Date to but excluding March 31, 2024, will bear interest at a rate of  
13.3% per annum (the “Current Rate”). From and including March 31, 2024 to but excluding the  
Maturity Date, the interest rate applicable to the Series 1 Debentures will be reset on an annual basis  
on March 31 of each year, at a rate equal to the annual average percentage change in the All-items  
Consumer Price Index during the 12 month period ending on December 31 in the prior year (which  
amount may be positive or negative) plus 6.5% (the “Floating Interest Rate”). Notwithstanding the  
foregoing, the interest rate applicable to the Series 1 Debentures will not be less than 0%. Interest, if  
any, will be payable quarterly in arrears in equal instalments on March 31, June 30, September 30  
and December 31 in each year. The Current Rate will only apply to the Series 1 Debentures in  
respect of the interest payments up to and including March 31, 2024. Effective March 31, 2024, the  
interest rate payable on the Series 1 Debentures will be based on the applicable Floating Interest  
Rate.  
All payments in respect of the Series 1 Debentures will be subordinated in right of payment to the  
prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the Company, which includes the Credit Facility.  
The Rights will be exercisable until 4:30 p.m. (Toronto time) (the “Expiry Time”) on September 29,  
2023 (the “Expiry Date”) at a price of C$133 per C$100 principal amount of Series 1 Debentures  
purchased, plus accrued interest in the amount of C$0.217 per C$100 principal amount of Series 1  
Debentures purchased on account of interest accrued on the Series 1 Debentures from, and including,  
September 30, 2023 to, but excluding the Issue Date. Rights not fully exercised prior to the Expiry  
Time on the Expiry Date will be void and of no further value.  
The Rights will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) under the symbol “CSU.RT”  
and will be posted for trading on the TSX until 12:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the Expiry Date, at  
which time they will be halted from trading. The TSX has approved the listing of the Rights and the  
Series 1 Debentures, subject to the Company fulfilling all of the requirements of the TSX.  
A copy of the Final Prospectus and, in the case of eligible Shareholders, statements issued under the  
Computershare Direct Registration System, accompanied by rights subscription forms representing  
the Rights to which they are entitled, will be mailed to registered Shareholders following the Record  
Date. Registered Shareholders wishing to exercise their Rights must forward the completed rights  
subscription forms along with the applicable subscription proceeds to Computershare Trust  
Company of Canada by no later than the Expiry Time. Shareholders who hold their Common Shares  
through an intermediary will receive materials and instructions from their intermediary.  
Further details regarding the Rights Offering and the Series 1 Debentures can be found in the Final  
Prospectus which has been filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov,

&lt;p&gt;Constellation Software, Inc. &amp;gt; &amp;gt; CONSTELLATION SOFTWARE INC. DECLARES DIVIDEND AND FILES FINAL PROSPECTUS IN RELATION TO PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED RIGHTS OFFERING OF SERIES 1 DEBENTURES&lt;br/&gt;
Toronto, Ontario – August 23, 2023 – Constellation Software Inc. (TSX: CSU) (the “Company”)&lt;br/&gt;
announced today that it has declared a special dividend (the “Rights Dividend”) pursuant to which&lt;br/&gt;
all common shareholders (the “Shareholders”) of record as of the close of business on September 1,&lt;br/&gt;
2023 (the “Record Date”) will be entitled to receive, by way of a dividend-in-kind, one right of the&lt;br/&gt;
Company (each, a “Right”) for each common share of the Company (the “Common Shares”) held.&lt;br/&gt;
This dividend has been designated as an eligible dividend for purposes of the Income Tax Act&lt;br/&gt;
(Canada) and any similar provincial and territorial legislation.&lt;br/&gt;
The Company also announced that it hasfiled a final short form prospectus (the “Final Prospectus”)&lt;br/&gt;
in relation to its previously announced rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) pursuant to which the&lt;br/&gt;
Company will issue the Rights in satisfaction of the Rights Dividend that will entitle the&lt;br/&gt;
Shareholders to purchase up to C$700 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured subordinated&lt;br/&gt;
floating rate debentures, Series 1 of the Company (the “Series 1 Debentures”).&lt;br/&gt;
The Series 1 Debentures will be issued as an additional tranche of, and will form a single series with,&lt;br/&gt;
the outstanding C$282.2 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured subordinated floating rate&lt;br/&gt;
debentures, Series 1 of the Company. There is no minimum principal amount of Debentures that&lt;br/&gt;
must be issuable upon the exercise of Rights.&lt;br/&gt;
The net proceeds of the Rights Offering are expected to be used by the Company to pay down&lt;br/&gt;
indebtedness under its existing credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), with any remaining proceeds&lt;br/&gt;
to be used for future acquisitions.&lt;br/&gt;
The Rights will be issued in satisfaction of the Rights Dividend in the amount of one Right per&lt;br/&gt;
Common Share. For every 3.03 Rights held, the holder of such Rights will be entitled to subscribe&lt;br/&gt;
for C$100 principal amount of Series 1 Debentures. The Rights and the Series 1 Debentures will be&lt;br/&gt;
qualified for distribution in each province and territory of Canada by way of the Final Prospectus&lt;br/&gt;
and the Debentures have been registered in the United States on Form F-7 under the United States&lt;br/&gt;
Securities Act of 1933, as amended.&lt;br/&gt;
The Series 1 Debentures are expected to be issued on October 6, 2023 (the “Issue Date”) and will&lt;br/&gt;
have the same terms and conditions as the currently outstanding unsecured subordinated floating rate&lt;br/&gt;
debentures, Series 1 of the Company.&lt;br/&gt;
The Series 1 Debentures have a maturity date of March 31, 2040 (the “Maturity Date”). The Series&lt;br/&gt;
1 Debentures will be issuable only in denominations of C$100 and integral multiples thereof and,&lt;br/&gt;
from and including the Issue Date to but excluding March 31, 2024, will bear interest at a rate of&lt;br/&gt;
13.3% per annum (the “Current Rate”). From and including March 31, 2024 to but excluding the&lt;br/&gt;
Maturity Date, the interest rate applicable to the Series 1 Debentures will be reset on an annual basis&lt;br/&gt;
on March 31 of each year, at a rate equal to the annual average percentage change in the All-items&lt;br/&gt;
Consumer Price Index during the 12 month period ending on December 31 in the prior year (which&lt;br/&gt;
amount may be positive or negative) plus 6.5% (the “Floating Interest Rate”). Notwithstanding the&lt;br/&gt;
foregoing, the interest rate applicable to the Series 1 Debentures will not be less than 0%. Interest, if&lt;br/&gt;
any, will be payable quarterly in arrears in equal instalments on March 31, June 30, September 30&lt;br/&gt;
and December 31 in each year. The Current Rate will only apply to the Series 1 Debentures in&lt;br/&gt;
respect of the interest payments up to and including March 31, 2024. Effective March 31, 2024, the&lt;br/&gt;
interest rate payable on the Series 1 Debentures will be based on the applicable Floating Interest&lt;br/&gt;
Rate.&lt;br/&gt;
All payments in respect of the Series 1 Debentures will be subordinated in right of payment to the&lt;br/&gt;
prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the Company, which includes the Credit Facility.&lt;br/&gt;
The Rights will be exercisable until 4:30 p.m. (Toronto time) (the “Expiry Time”) on September 29,&lt;br/&gt;
2023 (the “Expiry Date”) at a price of C$133 per C$100 principal amount of Series 1 Debentures&lt;br/&gt;
purchased, plus accrued interest in the amount of C$0.217 per C$100 principal amount of Series 1&lt;br/&gt;
Debentures purchased on account of interest accrued on the Series 1 Debentures from, and including,&lt;br/&gt;
September 30, 2023 to, but excluding the Issue Date. Rights not fully exercised prior to the Expiry&lt;br/&gt;
Time on the Expiry Date will be void and of no further value.&lt;br/&gt;

I was thinking I would split my portfolio something like this: 
60% USA
20% North-Western Europe
10% Eastern Europe (not Russia)
10% India

My strategy is as following: 
I realise it’s a lot of western world, first-world countries, especially USA. But in my mind I should stick to politically and militarily stable nations with low levels of corruption and bureaucracy. This basically excludes all of Africa, Middle east (except Israel) and most of Asia. 

What I know of my own home EU, is that it’s a heavily taxed and bureaucratic mess and it’s share of total world-wealth has been shrinking while USA’s has stayed the same. On top of that it’s old money, old companies, old nations with workers who rather strikes than innovates. It’s hard doing business and starting new companies, e.g in Sweden it’s almost impossible firing people even if they are jot qualified for what you now need them to do. 

USA is an economical Juggernaut with low level of burocracy. They rule the world. They are not threatened militarily, politically or economically by anyone anymore. China is definitely on the decline so in the end it turned out no one could challenge Pax-Americana after all. The only real threat against USA today is internal polarisation. Their companies are frankly great and often the ones innovating today. 

I believe India has potential for the future, though their bureaucracy is on an absurd level where it is sometimes easier exporting and importing goods from other countries than between regions internally, but their TFR is looking good as well as many other factors such as democracy and english proficiency (ease of doing business with the west as well as taking up production from China).

I understand how the ‘power law’ reduces idiosyncratic risk, but some prestigious, titans of VC/SV have been very keen to raise industry-specific funds over the past few years in the hopes of catching fledgling industries, which obviously concentrates sector-specific risk.

I think often about a16z and how they have 4 separate funds that are each dedicated to crypto. The size of these funds are quite significant, with the latest crypto-only fund (raised in 2022) having an initial raise/starting capital of $4.5B. In aggregate, around 22% of a16z’s AUM is currently in crypto-only funds. I can’t help but feel that when the entire crypto-ponzi collapses, this could mark the death of a16z after LPs in these funds make near 100% losses on the crypto-focussed funds. I assume other notable VC houses like Sequoia will take a big hit, although a16z is by far the largest VC to have shovelled a substantial amount of its AUM into a giant ponzi, as far as I can make out.

I note that a16z’s ‘best bets’, namely Coinbase and AirBnB, have both slumped post-IPO, with returns of -79% and -30% over their public equity lives (so far), and so a16z may have a much harder time pulling off eye-watering valuations for their next round of IPOs, crypto or otherwise.

I guess years of low interest rates can make anyone look like an investing genius, and in higher rate environments, the fads don’t last.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

It seems like the market sentiment up until a couple weeks ago was that inflation would continue to moderate at a consistent pace, causing interest rates to plateau, and allowing stocks to be favorable.

In my opinion, the chances of inflation moderating at a consistent pace are low. If oil prices spike than wouldn't that cause a ripple effect of interested rates either climbing or staying at the current levels for longer? If that is the case, I would imagine there would be a slow bleed to stocks, especially the cash flow negative ones. 

There's always the chance of an unknown-unknown, Black-Swan event but what would be the most likely knowns to be the catalyst for a sell off? More banks using the repo market and failing? Credit default from commercial real estate or consumers?

&lt;p&gt;It seems like the market sentiment up until a couple weeks ago was that inflation would continue to moderate at a consistent pace, causing interest rates to plateau, and allowing stocks to be favorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the chances of inflation moderating at a consistent pace are low.

233,investing,"56 yo - recently laid off - trying to figure out the best stock/bond allocation across two 401K's and one taxable account.  I've read that yield producing bonds are better held in 401K accounts.  But i've also read that equities - if you don't need the money short term - should be held in 401K accounts.  In my case, i'd feel better having some bond income I can rely on.

So lets say my target stock/bond allocation is 67/33, and I have 3MM equally distributed across 2 401K's and 1 taxable account.  Which is the better allocation...

OPTION 1:  401K (A) = 100% equities |  401K (B) = 100% equities | TAXABLE = 100% fixed income

OPTION 2:  401K (A) = 67/33  |  401K (B) = 67/33 | TAXABLE = 67/33

I like option 2 because it's much easier to rebalance (as each account is compartmentalized).  I don't like option 2 because bond yield is less, and it's less tax efficient.

I like option 1 for the income.

Your thoughts are appreciated, thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;56 yo - recently laid off - trying to figure out the best stock/bond allocation across two 401K&amp;#39;s and one taxable account.

I'm also wondering if I should drop the 4% VNQ or not or if I should add BND.I have 20-30 years to retirement and my risk tolerance is high.So the 2 main differences in these are the international equity exposure.

One method uses VT and the international exposure will fluctuate with the market. The other uses VTI and VXUS to control the international exposure at a fixed 20% (Jack Bogle's advice to never go over 20% into international).

I also added 50% to of the equity portion VOO because it seems that both Jack Boggle and Warren Buffet like the S&amp;P 500. This will make it heavyweight in the S&amp;P 500.

Overall, I can't decide who's right. Some people like just one of the core Equity ETFs I used (VT, VTI or VOO) and I tried to split the difference.

Currently living in a nice 2 bed apartment 800 euros per month. The rent is about 15% of our household income combined.

We then want to get a 2nd investment property as soon as possible via job savings, equity and airbnb income.

All while renting cheap as its flexible and offers flexibility with my job moving me around which can happen.

Is this a good strategy? Is it okay to rent reasonably while investing in rental properties in this way? We would want to get a family home in the long term but not in the next 3-5 years.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a thoughtful question to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

Disclaimer: I am an european based investor so I am using ETFs available in EU and fiscally optimized, so you could see unfamiliar tickers but please take in consideration the tracked indexes.

Parameters

1. After some research on Fama/French Factors I want to introduce the factor of Value and Quality into the Developed market stock ETFs tracking **MSCI World Sector Neutral Quality Index** and **MSCI World Enhanced Value Index** (if you know better index to use please let me know, these are the ones I found that I can invest -VTV for example is unavailable in EU- but would like to see alternatives). Equal weight between the 2
2. Introduce a size factor with Small Caps but with focus on Value since this is the portion of the SC that gives better returns. The only option here for me is mixing **MSCI US Small Cap Value** and **MSCI EU Small Cap Value**, unluckily I don't have options for World Small Cap Value in EU. Here I would overweight US Small Cap to sort of recreate a total market cap weight.
3. After long thoughts I decided to exclude Emerging Markets from the portfolio, since I am reading a lot on it and I am starting to get convinced that the risk/return is not so appealing due to more uncertainty of the political and financial landscape of these countries.

I have done different backtests and the results are interesting. First of all I noticed that there was a quite strong volatility and playing around with different hedges I have seen that a 10% Gold reduces yearly return of less than 0.1% on 25 years period but mitigates significantly the volatility. I am not a fan of Gold but I added into the test portfolio that is now as following

&amp;#x200B;

* **35% MSCI World Sector Neutral Quality Index ETF (XDEV)**
* **35% MSCI World Enhanced Value Index ETF (XDEQ)**
* **12.5% MSCI US Small Cap Value ETF (ZPRV)**
* **7,5% MSCI EU Small Cap Value ETF (ZPRX)**
* **10% Gold ETF (SGLD)**

I have then backtested it against SP500 (last 25 years)

and world total stock (VWCE last 20 years)

[https://imgur.com/bPjYAi7](https://imgur.com/bPjYAi7)

I tried do backtest for a longer period but cant find a tool to do it. If anyone has a way to do that would be fantastic.

As you see the portfolio performed significantly better in terms of total returns. On yearly returns it was almost 1% better than SP500 and 1,5% of Total World. 

Also I have calculated some indicators (at today)

&lt;p&gt;I tried do backtest for a longer period but cant find a tool to do it. If anyone has a way to do that would be fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you see the portfolio performed significantly better in terms of total returns. On yearly returns it was almost 1% better than SP500 and 1,5% of Total World. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I have calculated some indicators (at today)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th align=""left""&gt;P/B&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;SP500&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;25,2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1,5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3,7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Total World&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1,74&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2,5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Factor Portfolio&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;12,9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2,7&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

255,investing,"Hi, just trying to learn. So we know RS/splits dont effect market cap. I am sort've struggling to understand why.

Market cap = shares outstanding \* stock price

The stock price obviously increases as well. Well if stock price and shares outstanding increases why wouldn't this increase market cap?

Chatgpt says this is understandably wrong and Reverse splits involve shares outstanding decreasing. Well, this is confusing to me too. If shares outstanding decreases then why did AMC's increase?

Having listened to Powell's speech, he mainly pointed out that core PCE inflation is still too high at 4.1%.

How does one calculate a total projected portfolio growth when dollar cost averaging? I don't even know if that's phrased well enough, so I'll try to explain what I mean.  
  
The SP500 has a growth of \~51% over the last 5 years, which is an average return of \~8.59% annually.  
  
If one is to dollar cost average, say yearly of the same amount and a ""fixed"" 8.59% annual return for simplicity, the growths at the end of the 5th year: the initial investment made at the start of year 1 is +51%, the 2nd year investment is +39%, the 3rd year investment is +28%, the 4th year investment is 17.9%, the 5th year investment is +8.6%.  
  
The total portfolio growth at the end of the 5th year is therefore \~+28.9%.  
  
If one makes a 6th year contribution, which has 0% growth, the portfolio growth drops to 24%. But by the end of the 6th year it's up to 33%.  
  
Is there a way to calculate that growth number with inputs for years of investing, DCA amount, DCA frequency, average annual rate of return?  
  
I guess even more importantly, is this metric even important? I don't really see ""total growth"" represented and the focus is always that annualized average growth. I'm just curious after say 30 or 40 years of investing, what's the total gain on the portfolio? One would constantly be averaging in that 0% at their latest DCA contribution, but the older investments would (hopefully) have a very high return while newer investments are still low just based on time spent in the market.  
  
Obviously it's understood some percentages are higher, some are lower or even negative, and the annualized average is historically near that 8% (call it 6-10%ish).

&lt;p&gt;The total portfolio growth at the end of the 5th year is therefore ~+28.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one makes a 6th year contribution, which has 0% growth, the portfolio growth drops to 24%. But by the end of the 6th year it&amp;#39;s up to 33%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to calculate that growth number with inputs for years of investing, DCA amount, DCA frequency, average annual rate of return?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess even more importantly, is this metric even important? I don&amp;#39;t really see &amp;quot;total growth&amp;quot; represented and the focus is always that annualized average growth. I&amp;#39;m just curious after say 30 or 40 years of investing, what&amp;#39;s the total gain on the portfolio? One would constantly be averaging in that 0% at their latest DCA contribution, but the older investments would (hopefully) have a very high return while newer investments are still low just based on time spent in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously it&amp;#39;s understood some percentages are higher, some are lower or even negative, and the annualized average is historically near that 8% (call it 6-10%ish).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for genuine responses. And cheers to the snarky ones if I&amp;#39;m a dummy.&lt;/p&gt;

Problem is, the holdings they were using are ""institution customers only"" funds that are kind of built for wealth managers to tool around with (and get paid a lil extra too). So that means they have huge expense ratios and I think some other stuff I don't understand... Stuff that makes them not really the best option for a personal investor to have.

They are Russell Tax Managed funds with expense ratios around 0.9-1.0%. It's a basic mix of bonds and stocks, only about 7 holdings total. Unfortunately one of them was *never* sold since 2017, so it has a huge capital gain. I don't know how to get rid of it at this point without incurring a ton of taxes.

I think I can manage some of the other holdings, a couple of them are a net loss, even after 8 years somehow... so I think I could offset that by selling one with an equal net gain.

But yeah, it's a process I think, and I'm on the fence about doing it at all. I don't know if it's worth it to mess around with it at this point, aside from just rebalancing every so often.

I have been pulling some out and transferring it into an individual investment account where I can actively manage it. I just realized though that the money I pull out will be taxed as income, and the same with the profits I eventually pull out of the new account. I obviously want to avoid having the money taxed twice...

  
**My question** Is there a tax law that allows for the money I put directly from one investment account into another investment account to not be taxed? I know if I did a transfer between brokers it's not taxable, which is essentially what I did except that it stopped in my personal checking account for a couple of days.

  
Any advice/help is appreciated... Thank you!!

1) Every Tuesday evening: Put $100 into investment of choice.
2) Conditionally, if the asset has dropped in value by 5% or more over 7 days, put another $100 into the same investment.

Is this still considered dollar cost averaging? Also does it go against the principles of sticking to a plan and not letting your emotions influence your decision  making?

In my past, I bought TSLA at $41, NVDA at $55, FB at $50 and GOOGL $120. Had I kept those, I would have been multi millionaire by now, but sold everything with trading mindset.

I've earned well over $600,000 and have nothing to show for it. Now recovered and diagnosed I am 31 with no super, no real expenses as my family is comfortable at the moment. I have $1,000 to my name personally. My income is only $1,000/fn until I start working. I am lucky enough to be on a disability support pension due to... horrific circumstances. 

Currently unsure whether I will study financial services further and growing up I always imagined I would have my own business (I see the irony).

1. Would be wise for me to start a superfund to make sure I am insured if I get a terminal illness or something bad happens out of my control.

My particular situation makes this confusing and I’m looking for any suggestions. Over 45yo / Married w 2 children/  Combined yrly income of about 350k and I live in a very HCOL city,  so with childcare and shelter, we’re pretty comfortable and have some extra $ each month. 

Firstly, I’m vested into a pension plan with my union that says I can expect to be getting about 2k per month when I retire. Not enough to live on in 20 years where I live. 

Secondly, I had a small non-active rollover IRA that I just reactivated, maxed out and invested in broad market funds through fidelity.

I’ve also just set up two 529s for my kids that I put money in each month. 

So, here I am with only a small pension and an underfunded (newly) maxed out RolloverIRA. So now I’m looking for additional options to supplement my retirement to make up for the lost time. I talked with a fidelity advisor and he pointed out that I really don’t have many options. Because I’m considered a “high income earner” (even though living in this city + childcare bleeds me dry) ..with an over 250k income, I am not allowed to even set up a personal 401k, Roth, SEP IRA, or any other tax advantaged vehicle.

So what then are my options? How does one strategize a retirement when all the tax advantaged vehicles are for &gt;200k income earners?  Am I stuck with just a small pension, social security,  and whatever this Rollover IRA makes over the next 20 years? Is the stock market ETF my only safe-ish option to put money into and hope I make up lost investment time? 

TLDR: Small pension + recently started Rollover IRA. What other catch-up retirement investment options are there for some one who makes over the 250k per year limit to make up for not getting started earlier?

You probably won't, because you're competing with bunches of other people who are smarter than you. Generally people are just taking more risk than they realize.

What about the opposite? Excluding stocks or sectors you consider junk whilst holding the market portfolio otherwise.

If you held every sector but crypto, you would have outperformed the market.

I heard of one study where it was found that small cap value stocks were found to underperform the market. This made no sense to the researchers as these stocks should outperform on average since they are riskier than the market. The study corrected this discrepancy by excluding stocks that met criteria for terminal decline.

The question is can one reasonably expect to identify stocks before or during terminal decline? For instance, with all the regulatory hoopla over digital money, it is likely wise to not own coinbase or the miners because even if they don't go to zero a lot of them will inevitably terminate in liquidation.

I started investing more than a year ago. Since then, I have been reading various books and following (IMO) credible people to learn how to evaluate companies for long time investing.  
  
I still have plenty of candidates to screen that I am interested in. However, I get stuck on some now since those are companies that are young (concerning being public). So, I find it hard to make a rational decision if it is worth a buy or not.  
  
Let me explain: I am a molecular biologist and had a job interview with a company that is dealing with synthetic biology (They did not take me but I found a job somewhere else). That topic was highly interesting. I read a bit into it and realized that there is huge growth potential in this industry for the coming years. Now, since I started screening biotech companies for the beginning (since this is something I know stuff about) I sometimes encounter the issue of not being able to evaluate a company based on them being too short on the market (aside from ALL other biotech companies that are overvalued or just hard to evaluate since the Pandemic just boosted all their share prices and revenue into oblivion for 2 year).  
  
Anyway, so I am specifically talking about Twist Bioscience, Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings and Azenta (maybe also Termo Scientific, but they are way too overvalued right now). So, for those companies, I cannot apply any of the standard valuations like calculation its ""fair"" value applying growth estimates through EPS and P/E. Also, discounted cash flow model is a problem since these companies are starting out and their numbers are red. Graham’s formula or the multiple valuation model is also useless since EPS and P/E are basically non-existent.  
  
I am fan of TWST. Have been a customer in the past and now again at my new position. Also, their plans, projects, and visions of TWST and DNA sound very intriguing and the CEOs seem rational, potent, and capable.  
  
I hope you see the dilemma I am in. There are potential candidates that I think have a big growth potential with a big intrinsic value (scientifically and culturally). However, I cannot predict the fair share price value due to limiting available data.  
  
What do you do in this situation? The only thing that seems to look ""good"" are revenue data and equity growth for these companies. Is it valid to just look at these datapoints? Because ROIC, EPS, cash or P/E are non-existing or in minus. Even though for example TWIST is a well-known and reliable company that obviously has a growing revenue steam.  
  
I am happy for any tips and discussions concerning this topic. I do not want your opinion if those companies are a buy or not. I want input concerning the process of making rational discissions based on the limited data available in this case and how to guestimate (?) the potential future of such innovative but young companies.

352,investing,"Hi, i have some spare money that i want to spend. I have read that a lump sum investment is most of the times better. First i thought to invest it all at once in a S&amp;P ETF. Then i researched that the S&amp;P is a composite index of the 11 sectors in which IT sector is 27% and healthcare is 15% and financial is 10% and energy only 2,5%

So i thought i could shape them on my own predictions.

So my preliminary plan is following:

1000 $ iShares S&amp;P 500 Information technology sector (slight recession fears for Q1/24, still good idea? could also invest more since i expect most growth in IT sector in all the market)

1000$ iShares World Healthcare sector (etf has lost a few %, maybe the dip is there and  new vaccines about to be distributed this fall/winter and also because of demographics i expect growth in this sector)

1000$ iShares S&amp;P 500 Consumer staples (defensive even in recession)

1000$ iShares World Energy sector (i believe that energy prices will still rise and the energy corps. won't invest so much for growth and instead they will rise prises to profit because of climate change )

Because of the recent defaults in the banking sector like SVB i predict no growth rather a downturn in financial sector (10% of the S&amp;P index, might dampen the index). For consumer discretionary i am not sure. It all depends if there will be a slight recession as the current news is indicating or that is already priced in as it alwalys is in the stock market. Also if the interest rate hikes end, more growth for IT sector and probably consumer discretionary could be anticipated. For communications services sector i am not sure.

Feel free to comment on my predictions or on my strategy. Maybe i am delusional and a fool. I simply don't want to wait if the S&amp;P remains sideways for years when in fact some sectors grow and some are in downturn. Because of the broad diversification i fear that i loose potentional gains.

364,investing,"Bonds are historically mediocre at returning positive real yields, which is why I've avoided them.  But it seems to me that using bonds to bet on an interest rate reversion seems promising.

Here are the premises, as I see them:

* 30 year T-bonds are paying [4.45%](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us)

* The Fed is seeking to return to 2% inflation.  During the 2010-2019 pre-covid era, at this inflation level, [30 year bond yields were about 1.5-2%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS30)

* There are good reasons to believe that the current episode of inflation is an economic readjustment from covid era shifts in demand, not a consequence of pre-covid low rates.

* If I use the zero-coupon bond equation value for interest rate r, par value V, years Y: Price=*P=V/(1+r)^Y* I get the following 30 year 3-year-holding period  nominal-dollar profits for holding bonds through an interest rate shift from rate r1 to r2, as *Profit = [(1+r2)^(Y-3)/(1+r1)^(Y)]-1*

    * +116% profit if 30 year bond rates drop to 'normal' level of 2% after 3 years

    * +66% profit if 30 year bond rates drop to 3% after 3 years

    * 1.2% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 5% after 3 years

    * 23.5% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 6% after 3 years

    * 40% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 7% after 3 years

If one is afraid of inflation during the holding period, one could pay a similar game with TIPS, which yield over 2%, but for recent history have tended to [cluster around 1%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII30).   In this case, buying TIPS at 2% and selling in 3 years at a 1% rate would yield a 38% real-dollar profit, or about 11% a year.

Personally, I think that it is far more likely for rates to hold steady or fall back to 2%, because the 2009 to 2020 2% inflation era seemed to work OK economically.

So under this reasoning, the sensible strategy might be to bail  out of stocks, pile into long-term T-bonds, and get back into stocks if and when stock prices (P/E) readjust to more closely reflect the traditional 4% equity risk premium, roughly   P/E=1/(2% real  bond yield + 4% equity risk premium )=17.  Or even if P/E doesn't fall, holding bonds through an interest rate decline would give one a lot more money to put into modestly historically overpriced stocks.

One of my reasons is that I already invest a hefty amount into funds which have majority Apple and Microsoft. I don't want my entire life's and retirement savings to be 30% dependent on 2 stocks no matter what they are.

I have found many ETFs which buy S&amp;P500 stocks based on various performance indicators. Some are quite speculative which doesn't interest me. But others are based on things such as quality factor, cash flow, volatility, etc.

A couple of examples are MOAT which is based on companies which have a wide moat, or competitive advantage, which would be difficult for competitors to overcome. Another is SPHQ which is based on quality factor.

Both of these ETFs have a 10 year return of higher than the S&amp;P500 despite both being based on S&amp;P stocks. They're just weighted and selected differently. Clearly this has been working and those strategies logically seem like they'd be successful

My question is why are these ETFs and others like them not as popular as the most common bulk, market cap weighted S&amp;P ETFs?

&lt;p&gt;this is not my situation. this is not anybody&amp;#39;s situation for that matter. we were discussing an hypothetical scenario among us. we were pondering over what happens if one were able to borrow at such low rates before fed rate hikes and might be sitting on that cash. what would they do. &lt;/p&gt;

I assume this CD is callable at any time over the 2 year maturity period.

What I thought YTW meant was the minimum yield I would receive if the CD called before maturity. I would have expected that to be less then the coupon rate itself, so I must be misunderstanding what all of this means.

Does this all mean that I just receive the coupon rate up until the date of being called with interest accumulation ending at the call date? (Which I thought was just YTC).

investopedia: ""Yield to worst is a measure of the lowest possible yield that can be received on a bond that fully operates within the terms of its contract without defaulting.""

and

""If a bond is callable, it becomes important to look at the YTW. The yield to maturity will always be higher than the YTW (YTC) because the investor earns more when they hold the bond for its full maturity. The YTW is important though because it provides deeper due diligence on a bond with a call provision. The shorter time frame a bond is held for, the less the investor earns. YTW provides a clear calculation of this potential scenario showing the lowest yield possible.""

So, in my example above, YTM, YTC, and YTW are all the same. That doesn't make sense to me.

=============================================================

So first of all I dont have Ph D in economics or not even remotely close, so bear with my ignorance. 

Going to what I want to say, and as we have witnessed that headline CPI is plummeted significantly in last 6 months, but core CPI is rather sticky and hold the line quite well. In fact, when looking at truflation data, CPI is creeping up in to 2.6% last 2 weeks. 

With this in mind, core CPI is more about service industry (i.e: travel/insurance/housing/medical expense) that often doesnt have strong basis for cost of goods sold. Unlike manufacturing jobs, service industry has no strong hold for consensus in terms of pricing. 

For example, it's like Amazon Prime membership that used to be 99$ before pre-pandemic. AMZN says it's increasing membership fee due to reason X,Y,Z but it all depends on how they net out the profits from online activity as well. What about Amazon's prime membership costs 140$, but Costco membership costs 120$? Who sets this up and for what reasons? 

Having said that, why not Fed consider madman's theory? Like let's say Fed officially announce that it may rate hike to 10% but only with multiple condition 1) that it will rate hike to 10% in next 4 months 2) depending on outcome of macro economy (i.e job reports/CPI/etc), it may not only reduce rate to 2%, but start to do QE if needed.

This will, obviously, bring chaos to financial markets (short term treasury rate will spike) and inevitable market corrections. This will also force many bankruptcy for leveraged business and many negative consequences to real economy. But, I believe that this will restore fed's credibility, which is the most important strategic assets to have in financial markets.  

But who actually trusts Fed today? Dont we all clearly remember that in late 2021, Fed expecting to rate hike, maybe early 2023? And we all know what happens in 2022. 

Like I am just so sick of one day that Morgan Stanley's talking about recession only to find out that next day Goldman Sachs talking about removal of hard landing. And this isn't much different than what we hear about governors of Fed says otherwise like one day Fed member says we are at the top of rate hike, but other day, another fed member says we should rate hike one or more.   


Current rate is 5.25 to 5.5% fed fund rate. 

Last CPI was 3.2% (headline) and 4.7% (Core), so current Fed rate is already high enough than Core CPI, isn't it? **According to Taylor's Rule, it should curb core CPI, but wouldn't it be painless if we can curb the expectations of inflation in a timely manner (rather quickly) than ""sit down and let's see what it will happen"".** 

Do I believe rate hike to 10% will increase the chance to crash the economy? Sure, that's why Fed should provide conditions such as quick rate cut to 2% if macros are proven to be crashing down. If that's factored in, maybe, the resilient economy that Fed members talk about all the time won't tank down as severe as they would think, which is why Fed can mention another conditions that they will (not could) do QE, IF needed. 

Just my thinking, but I wanted to see what other folks think about this as well.

395,investing,"I'm a 26yr M with a pretty good grip on stock investment knowledge. What makes a good investment etc etc. 
But recently with Treasury Bond yields at highs I've delved into some new research on them

I've always understood they're a long-term safe investment with a low-moderate yield. But now I'm seeing that you can buy bonds, get the yearly yield while you have it, and ALSO trade them in the process. The price of Bonds tends to increase as Fed interest rates lower, and decrease as Fed interest rates increase.

My question is: with bond yields so high right now, and the price of bonds going up when Fed interest rates go down, and a volatile uncertain market, it sounds like a REALLY great idea to put a ton of money in some bonds, get 5+% interest on them in the meantime, then when rates go down you can sell them at a profit.
I'm looking at 1month-1year Bonds. The 3-6 month Bonds seem like such a great small time window.

Is there any reason to not do this??

I haven't been able to see/find a chart of the price of bonds on the open market, only yield rates, so I don't actually know how much you can profit on a bond when Fed interest rates go down. A Futures chart isn't the open market price right? 
But overall I can't really see why I wouldn't do this unless I wanted way higher gains in the equities market. Which could also definitely happen when Fed rates lower.

400,investing,"Since no one can predict the future, the general wisdom is that it is best to hold a diversified portfolio.  

As far as equities go, one could just buy something like VT, and own everything in the world in a proportional weighting.   

But then you could also buy something like VTI and VXUS and balance the weight to be something like that of VT.   

And you could further divide up VTI into its various components (small, mid, large cap) and own funds for all of those, and do similarly for VXUS, perhaps also dividing VXUS up into different funds based on things like developed markets versus emerging markets, and so on.

My understanding is that a major part of diversifying is that at any given time, some things are winning and some things are losing.   If you need to cash in on some of your investments, you want to cash in when that investment is winning, so that you don't take a loss.   

It seems to me that if you have one giant generic fund (like VT), the losers are pulling down your winners at any given time, and the winners are pulling up the losers.   You get the average of all of that activity.  

On the other hand, it would seem that if you separate out the various components of something like VT, it gives you the flexibility to cash out only your winners when you need funds.  Intuitively, it seems that this would enable you to do much better than if you hold all your stuff in a single investment, and have to cash everything in at the same time.

I'm wondering if anyone can point to any good information on this, or offer any thoughts on this.   If this is the case, what would be the merit of owning very broad mutual funds/etfs and the like?   

The main argument I can see is that owning something like VT, or VTI/VXUS allows one to easily maintain a desired weighting combined with a sort of ""set it and forget it"" mentality.   It's less fiddly.   The more funds you get into (or even specific stocks... as that would give the greatest control, of course), the more you have to track things to make sure you aren't underweighting or overweighting certain parts of your portfolio, and that is not necessarily a small task.

410,investing,"Hi there, posted this in financial planning initially but thought I might get more replies here. I'm a married 37-year-old with a kid on the way. I'm in a creative/artistic field and although I've (thankfully) done very well, there are the occasional dry periods where I'm unsure of when my next check is going to come. Because of this, I'm toying with the idea of investing some money into high-yield dividend stocks and REITS, to help get some more consistent income during those dry periods, as I'm the primary earner in our house. Was hoping to get some advice on the below dividend strategy. Here's some additional info:

&amp;#x200B;

* Spouse (35) and I (37) both have well-funded retirement accounts. For the most part, 70% of it is in VTI and 30% is in VXUS. We'll continue this strategy with future contributions.
* I am fully vested in a pension that (as of today) will pay approximately $45K a year when I retire. I believe this number will go up. I'm eligible to start collecting at 52 for a reduced amount but plan to hold out until my 60s. Note: this pension is separate from our retirement accounts mentioned above.
* Spouse has a stable high-paying job. If we had to, we could afford all of our bills with just my spouse's income. It would be tight though.
* Despite my pension, I will be eligible for SS benefits as is my spouse.
* We have about two years' worth of emergency funds sitting in a HYSA (4.65%). Given the unusual nature of my work, I try to keep a healthy amount of rainy-day money available.
* We live in a HCOL area and our home is 30% paid off.
* We fully own one car (leasing another) and student loans aren't too far from being fully paid off.

  
As I mentioned, I'm looking to invest in some high-yield dividends and REITS into a taxable brokerage account to help with the dry periods. This isn't meant to replace a salary, but instead cover bills and ensure some additional income is available if needed. When I don't need this, I will be letting the dividends DRIP. Although ideally, these stocks will grow, my main focus with this portion of my investments is stable and reliable income. Here's are the stocks/REITS I'm considering, with each making up 10% of the portfolio:  

SCHD  
JEPI  
PFE  
0  
ABR  
VNQ  
WBA  
ARCC  
EPD  
MAIN  

Altogether, these would produce approximately a 7.04% dividend yield. I'm hoping this is reasonably diversified, though I realize there's probably some overlap. What are your thoughts on this strategy? Does this make sense given my situation? Are there some other stocks I should consider? Right now I'm diversified between ten stocks, would you expand that to 20 (with each making up 5%) for added protection? Please feel free to poke holes as I'm very much in the early research phase of this plan.

Hello everyone.   
This might be a silly question, but one I would like some answers to nonetheless.   
There is a stock I've been following lately and I have noticed the price has remained relatively flat for a while. Volume fluctuates but typically the price doesn't move.  
So, here is my hypothetical scenario question based on what I've seen with this stock-  
A company has 1M outstanding shares, and every day the volume fluctuates between 10k and 50k shares, the price per share doesn't change. Every day, the stocks are bought and sold at 5 cents.  
If I check the level 2 quotes and buy all shares available for 5 cents and hold them, then wait for more to be up for sale at 5 cents or less, and I continuously buy every share that is available at 5 cents or less, eventually, the stock wouldn't go below 5 cents? If I end up buying every share in the company and don't put them up for sale, will the price go up as people bid higher? Or will the price only hit what I'm willing to sell them at? If I choose to sell 10k shares at 10 cents but the highest bid is 8 cents, does the price say 10 or 8, or fall in the middle? Lastly, if I choose to sell at 10 but there are no bids, is the price 0?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone.&lt;br/&gt;

418,investing,"*A Random Walk Down Wall Street* by Burton Malkiel is known as a generally good starting point for people who are new to investingIt also, as it happens, had been recommended to me by a fellow redditor as an overall correct but not too dense book that will be of actual help to personal finance newbies that does more than regurgitate financial common sense. 

Even so, when I went into this book I really just expected it to rehash things I already read in other books but perhaps more thoroughly. I wasn't entirely wrong, a lot of information had in fact been repeated, but I also wasn't entirely right. Malkiel actually has something of a unique perspective when it comes to money management so I figure it's worth sharing some of what he has to say:

* **Before you are able to take advantage of market inefficiencies, you must know the ways that the market is actually efficient** \-  Investors fall into one of two camps: active investors who pick stocks and passive investors who buy index funds. For the most part, passive investors believe everything is priced in and it would be a waste of time to try to beat the market. Meanwhile, active investors generally believe that markets are inefficient and there are ways to beat the market, provided the correct technique, analysis, and/or research. Malkiel is more of a passive investor than active, not because he believes the market is perfectly efficient, but because he thinks the stock market is far more efficient than most active investors think. It's kind of like that old saying, ""you must first learn the rules before you can break them.""
* **Functionally speaking, the stock market is highly efficient in the short term...** \- Due to technology allowing us to constantly check on our portfolio's performance and investing professionals regularly being subjected to evaluations based on how much their investments appreciated in a given quarter, we tend to strive for short term gains over long term gains. The result is that in the short term, markets are highly efficient. Take for example the January effect, where stocks were consistently undervalued in January because people sold poor performing stocks in January in hopes of lowering their required tax payment. The moment this information was publicized, people rushed to buy stock in January and the renewed demand instantly erased the market inefficiency. To paraphrase Malkiel, if people know stocks will go up tomorrow, it will go up today.
* **But opportunities from market inefficiency arise in the long term** \- To clarify, by ""long term"" investing, I don't mean several months or even a year. Long term means several years, sometimes even several decades. Only in the long term do market inefficiencies correct and reveal itself as important. There are major hurtles to actually investing in a company long term. There's the difficulty of picking the right company, of needing funds for big purchases like a house, and the mental struggle of seeing the stock repeatedly and continually rise and fall in price as the years go on, constantly tempting you to sell. Because so few people are able to effectively select companies and stay invested in the long term, the market is actually much less efficient and so there are much more opportunities to beat the market. Just look at Warren Buffett.
* **Retail investors have several massive advantages over professional fund managers so don't get too discouraged when you hear that most professional investors don't beat the market** \- It's always in the wall street finance professional's interest to convince you that investing is difficult should be left to them. Malkiel disagrees, and cites several reasons for why you have an advantage over a large fund manager:

1. ***Many mutual funds aren't actually as motivated to beat the market as they should be.*** Although beating the market is ideal, it's far more preferable to get market returns than selecting stocks that perform worse than the market. For this reason, mutual fund managers sometimes just copy the index out of fear for their career. As an individual investor, you aren't doing it as a career and you aren't beholden to other investors. If you don't need the funds, you can afford to perform worse than the market for a quarter or longer in pursuit of better long term returns.
2. ***The size of a mutual fund means managers frequently have to put money in subpar companies so they're fully invested.*** It's much easier to invest $500 million in excellent companies than $50 billion - there just aren't enough investment opportunities. The cruel irony is that the better a fund manager is at generating high returns, the more people will want to invest in their mutual fund, thus ballooning the funds they have to manage and ultimately undercutting their effectiveness.
3. Another point about the size of mutual funds**:** ***when mutual funds buy stocks, it has an effect on the price.*** As a retail investor, you can buy and sell stocks for the marked price, but managers of large funds are forced to sell their stocks at a discount and buy at a premium simply due to the size of the transaction.

I should say that in this post, I've made it sound like Malkiel supports active investing. He does not. He's actually a proponent of buying index funds primarily, but also REITs, international index funds, and a bit of gold for diversification. I'm cherry picking points from the book which favors active investing because passive investing is much easier than active investing. For the passive investors reading this post, feel free to continue doing what you're doing with the knowledge that you have Burton Malkiel's full support. For the active investors, I hope some of the points raised here are helpful to you in your quest to beat the market.

Overall I found A Random Walk to be a helpful and interesting read. The book is somewhat long (the edition I read is 456 pages) so I've left quite a bit of it out due to necessity. If you guys have anything to add, definitely feel free. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; by Burton Malkiel is known as a generally good starting point for people who are new to investingIt also, as it happens, had been recommended to me by a fellow redditor as an overall correct but not too dense book that will be of actual help to personal finance newbies that does more than regurgitate financial common sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, when I went into this book I really just expected it to rehash things I already read in other books but perhaps more thoroughly. I wasn&amp;#39;t entirely wrong, a lot of information had in fact been repeated, but I also wasn&amp;#39;t entirely right. Malkiel actually has something of a unique perspective when it comes to money management so I figure it&amp;#39;s worth sharing some of what he has to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you are able to take advantage of market inefficiencies, you must know the ways that the market is actually efficient&lt;/strong&gt; -  Investors fall into one of two camps: active investors who pick stocks and passive investors who buy index funds. For the most part, passive investors believe everything is priced in and it would be a waste of time to try to beat the market. Meanwhile, active investors generally believe that markets are inefficient and there are ways to beat the market, provided the correct technique, analysis, and/or research. Malkiel is more of a passive investor than active, not because he believes the market is perfectly efficient, but because he thinks the stock market is far more efficient than most active investors think. It&amp;#39;s kind of like that old saying, &amp;quot;you must first learn the rules before you can break them.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functionally speaking, the stock market is highly efficient in the short term...&lt;/strong&gt; - Due to technology allowing us to constantly check on our portfolio&amp;#39;s performance and investing professionals regularly being subjected to evaluations based on how much their investments appreciated in a given quarter, we tend to strive for short term gains over long term gains. The result is that in the short term, markets are highly efficient. Take for example the January effect, where stocks were consistently undervalued in January because people sold poor performing stocks in January in hopes of lowering their required tax payment. The moment this information was publicized, people rushed to buy stock in January and the renewed demand instantly erased the market inefficiency. To paraphrase Malkiel, if people know stocks will go up tomorrow, it will go up today.&lt;/li&gt;

It reported 2Q 2023 this week and was **trading at -28% from previous day close**

Here is a summary of Storskogen's financial performance based on their second quarter 2023 earnings release:

|Financial Metric|Q2 2022|Q2 2023|Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|SEK 9,059M|SEK 9,462M|\+4%|
|Adjusted EBITA|SEK 877M|SEK 922M|\+5%|
|Operating Profit|SEK 681M|SEK 605M|\-11%|
|Operating Margin|7.5%|6.4%|\-1.1pp|
|Net Income|SEK 474M|SEK 115M|\-76%|
|EPS|SEK 0.25|SEK 0.04|\-83%|

\- **Profit** for the period **fell 76%** to SEK 115 million.

\- The Trade business area saw lower consumer demand affecting sales and profits. The Services business area improved thanks to high occupancy rates. Industry continued to perform well.

\- Cash flow from operating activities increased significantly to SEK 852 million from SEK 335 million last year.- Net debt to adjusted EBITDA remained stable at 2.6x.

Overall, Storskogen delivered modest top line growth but profits declined amid a tougher economic climate mainly affecting consumer sentiment. The company maintained a strong financial position and cash flows improved markedly. Storskogen continues to focus on cash flow generation and profitability in the near term.

&amp;#x200B;

It is a good business and management seem to have a good track record in the field. Let's breakdown in simple words how they make money:

&gt;*Storskogen* is a conglomerate that owns a portfolio of small and medium-sized businesses across three segments - **Trade, Industry, and Services.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The **Trade** segment includes distributors and wholesalers of physical products like home furnishings, health and beauty items, sports equipment, etc. This segment generates revenue by selling these products to retailers or directly to consumers.  
&gt;  
&gt;The **Industry** segment contains traditional industrial companies involved in manufacturing, automation, and technology services. These companies make money by producing and selling various industrial products and solutions.  
&gt;  
&gt;The **Services** segment provides business-to-business services in areas like contracting, infrastructure, installation, logistics, and more. Revenue comes from selling these services to other businesses.  
&gt;  
&gt;Storskogen aims to acquire profitable niche businesses in these segments and help them grow further under its ownership. The operating companies charge their customers for the products or services provided.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the parent level, Storskogen derives profits from the earnings of all the operating businesses it owns. By having a diversified portfolio across segments, Storskogen can maintain stable cash flows as some segments may perform better than others in different market conditions.So in summary, Storskogen generates revenue through the sales of its underlying business units and creates shareholder value by acquiring, growing and operating a diverse mix of companies. The decentralized model allows each unit to focus on its respective industry and customers.

These are the companies they hold:

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Profit&lt;/strong&gt; for the period &lt;strong&gt;fell 76%&lt;/strong&gt; to SEK 115 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The Trade business area saw lower consumer demand affecting sales and profits. The Services business area improved thanks to high occupancy rates. Industry continued to perform well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Cash flow from operating activities increased significantly to SEK 852 million from SEK 335 million last year.- Net debt to adjusted EBITDA remained stable at 2.6x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Storskogen delivered modest top line growth but profits declined amid a tougher economic climate mainly affecting consumer sentiment. The company maintained a strong financial position and cash flows improved markedly. Storskogen continues to focus on cash flow generation and profitability in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see YoY Income Statement and Share Price (it was listed in 2021) in the following chart:&lt;a href=""https://snipboard.io/hlNEW8.jpg""&gt;https://snipboard.io/hlNEW8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a good business and management seem to have a good track record in the field. Let&amp;#39;s breakdown in simple words how they make money:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Storskogen&lt;/em&gt; is a conglomerate that owns a portfolio of small and medium-sized businesses across three segments - &lt;strong&gt;Trade, Industry, and Services.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Trade&lt;/strong&gt; segment includes distributors and wholesalers of physical products like home furnishings, health and beauty items, sports equipment, etc. This segment generates revenue by selling these products to retailers or directly to consumers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt; segment contains traditional industrial companies involved in manufacturing, automation, and technology services. These companies make money by producing and selling various industrial products and solutions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Services&lt;/strong&gt; segment provides business-to-business services in areas like contracting, infrastructure, installation, logistics, and more. Revenue comes from selling these services to other businesses.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storskogen aims to acquire profitable niche businesses in these segments and help them grow further under its ownership. The operating companies charge their customers for the products or services provided.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the parent level, Storskogen derives profits from the earnings of all the operating businesses it owns. By having a diversified portfolio across segments, Storskogen can maintain stable cash flows as some segments may perform better than others in different market conditions.So in summary, Storskogen generates revenue through the sales of its underlying business units and creates shareholder value by acquiring, growing and operating a diverse mix of companies. The decentralized model allows each unit to focus on its respective industry and customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the companies they hold:&lt;br/&gt;

435,investing,"There are two ways to determine the value of something. One is for products, commodities, services, and similar items. The other is for financial instruments. In the first instance, the higher the utility derived from consuming an item, the higher its value. For example. More utility can be derived from a house, a precious metal, or a medical service, than from a tent, a base metal, or a cleaning service. That is why the first is more valuable than the second. Here however we are not interested in determining such value. Bitcoin is not a consumable item but an electronic database record. It belongs to the category of financial instruments because all such instruments are records, either paper or electronic. And in the case of financial instruments, value is determined based on payments and returns that an instrument can provide during its market life, at maturity, or at withdrawal. Let's now briefly demonstrate what that means by using the most widespread financial instruments - stocks, bonds, and fiat currencies. Then, we will determine the value of bitcoin.

During the market life of stocks, they pay dividends, while at their withdrawal for buybacks or due to liquidation of a company, they return capital to shareholders. The value here obviously depends on the size of those payments and returns. If a stock issuer can pay higher dividends and return more capital, the value of that stock will be higher, and vice versa. Bonds pay coupons during their market life and return face value at maturity. Here also, if a bond issuer can pay higher coupons and return more face value, the worth of that bond will be higher, and vice versa.

Fiat currencies pay nothing during their market life but they return items before their withdrawal from the market. Namely, when units of fiat currencies are created by loans from commercial banks or by purchasing government bonds from central banks, their beneficiaries use them to get products, commodities, services, and other items from the market. But as these units represent debt, the beneficiaries are forced to later return such items to the market to get the units for paying that debt. With debt payments, units are withdrawn from the market the same as bonds are withdrawn at maturity and stocks at buybacks or liquidation of companies. The value here depends on the size of the returns. If the beneficiaries can return more items, the value of a currency will be higher, and vice versa.

Now that we know how the value of financial instruments is determined we can turn to bitcoin. Let's first check for payments during market life. Does the issuer of bitcoin pay something like coupons or dividends to bitcoin holders? Well, no. Even in theory, this is not possible given that bitcoin is issued by a computer program, and not by some legal entity that must pay something. Let's then check for returns at maturity or at withdrawal. Here also, there is nothing to check. Bitcoin has no maturity and it is never withdrawn from the market to return something to its holders. It takes electricity when issued, but it never returns anything. As there are no payments and no returns, we can easily determine that the value of bitcoin is zero.

But what about all those narratives about bitcoin's value that circulate on legacy or social media? Well, they are just theories based on the misconception that the value of a financial instrument comes from the technology through which it is exchanged or its limited supply. Namely, given that bitcoin is easy to transfer, stored and protected in a decentralized manner, immutable, and limited in supply, the story goes that this somehow makes it valuable. But suppose that some stock broker implements the best possible technology for transferring and storing stocks. Would that change the value of these stocks? Would for example Tesla stock become mega expensive because of that? No, that is nonsensical. Such implementation would be unrelated to how much dividend Tesla can pay or how much capital it can return to shareholders. 

Or suppose that shares of a stock of a bankrupt company become limited in supply due to a reverse split. Would that magically make these shares valuable? No, given that the company has zero capital to pay or return something to shareholders. But if capital is above zero then the reduction of supply by a reverse split will automatically make shares more valuable. Limited supply affecting the value of a financial instrument presupposes the existence of value. However, just having a limited supply and nothing else cannot magically make value to appear. So, just because bitcoin as a financial instrument (electronic record) is limited in supply that doesn't make it valuable. But people are free to pay a million dollars for bitcoin just like they can do that for a share of a bankrupt company if they believe in the theory that limited supply can make value to appear. 

A lot of people have invested in bitcoin and understandably, a myriad of theories emerged about its value, with some of them being pretty weird and nonsensical. Like the one that confuses price with value and goes like this: ""The value of bitcoin is whatever someone is willing to pay for it"". According to that theory if one is willing to pay ten shares of a company ABC for one share of that company, then one share has the same value as ten shares. So pretty nonsensical. But people obviously have to rationalize their purchase of a worthless financial instrument, regardless of how unfounded their rationalizations are. After all, they have to sell it to someone else to return the investments. This forces them to invent or spread various theories about its value. In reality, however, the value of bitcoin has always been, and will always be zero. And everything that is going on around it is just the greater fool theory taken to the extreme.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to determine the value of something.

\*\***Background:**\*\*Adyen is a company that provides payment processing and acquiring services to merchants. They work with third parties like financial institutions and network scheme providers to enable these services.The fees charged to Adyen by these third parties are known as ""pass-through settlement fees"", which include interchange and payment network fees.

|Financial Metric|H1 2022|H1 2023|YoY Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|€3,947M|€854M|**-78%**|
|**Net Revenue**|€609M|€739M|**+21%**|
|Operating Income|€331M|€279M|\-16%|
|**Net Income**|€282M|€282M|**Flat**|
|Diluted EPS|€9.09|€9.07|\-0.2%|
|EBITDA|€356M|€320M|\-10%|
|EBITDA Margin|59%|43%|\-16pp|
|Free Cash Flow|€309M|€248M|\-20%|
|Cash Balance|€5,584M|€6,412M|\+15%|

The significant decline in revenue was due to the change in revenue recognition methodology for settlement fees in 2023. Net revenue, which excludes settlement fees, increased 21%.

\*\***Previous Policy**:\*\*Up to December 31, 2022, Adyen considered itself primarily responsible for providing payment transaction services. This means they had control over the full settlement service before it was transferred to merchants. In accounting terms, Adyen acted as the ""Principal"" for these fees. When acting as a Principal:Adyen would recognize both the revenue from the fees charged to merchants and the costs from the third parties on a gross basis. This means both the revenue and the costs were shown in full in the financial statements.

\*\***Change in Policy**:\*\*In H1 2023, Adyen made changes to its terms and conditions related to merchant agreements. These changes clarified the roles and responsibilities of the services provided by third parties. The key points from this change are:Adyen does not provide a significant service of integrating the services from third parties into one combined output for the merchant.Adyen does not control the inputs from third parties before services are provided to the merchant.Because of these changes, Adyen now acts as an ""Agent"" for the pass-through settlement fees, effective from January 1, 2023.

\*\***Impact of Acting as an Agent**:\*\*When acting as an Agent:Adyen only recognizes the net amount (i.e., the difference between what they charge the merchant and what they pay to third parties) in the revenue. This means the gross revenue and the costs from third parties are no longer shown in full in the financial statements.

\*\***Financial Impact**:\*\*Looking at the financial data provided:In H1 2022 (before the change), Settlement fees were €3,641,350 and Costs incurred from financial institutions were €3,313,269.In H1 2023 (after the change), Settlement fees dropped significantly to €485,582, and Costs incurred from financial institutions were only €74,409.This drastic reduction is because, in 2023, Adyen is only recognizing the net amount in the revenue, whereas in 2022, they were recognizing the full gross amount.

This is how the Revenue growth in the last 9 Yrs looks like:[https://snipboard.io/1vM0jO.jpg](https://snipboard.io/1vM0jO.jpg)

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significant decline in revenue was due to the change in revenue recognition methodology for settlement fees in 2023. Net revenue, which excludes settlement fees, increased 21%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;strong&gt;Previous Policy&lt;/strong&gt;:**Up to December 31, 2022, Adyen considered itself primarily responsible for providing payment transaction services. This means they had control over the full settlement service before it was transferred to merchants. In accounting terms, Adyen acted as the &amp;quot;Principal&amp;quot; for these fees. When acting as a Principal:Adyen would recognize both the revenue from the fees charged to merchants and the costs from the third parties on a gross basis. This means both the revenue and the costs were shown in full in the financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;strong&gt;Change in Policy&lt;/strong&gt;:**In H1 2023, Adyen made changes to its terms and conditions related to merchant agreements. These changes clarified the roles and responsibilities of the services provided by third parties. The key points from this change are:Adyen does not provide a significant service of integrating the services from third parties into one combined output for the merchant.Adyen does not control the inputs from third parties before services are provided to the merchant.Because of these changes, Adyen now acts as an &amp;quot;Agent&amp;quot; for the pass-through settlement fees, effective from January 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;strong&gt;Impact of Acting as an Agent&lt;/strong&gt;:**When acting as an Agent:Adyen only recognizes the net amount (i.e., the difference between what they charge the merchant and what they pay to third parties) in the revenue. This means the gross revenue and the costs from third parties are no longer shown in full in the financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;strong&gt;Financial Impact&lt;/strong&gt;:**Looking at the financial data provided:In H1 2022 (before the change), Settlement fees were €3,641,350 and Costs incurred from financial institutions were €3,313,269.In H1 2023 (after the change), Settlement fees dropped significantly to €485,582, and Costs incurred from financial institutions were only €74,409.This drastic reduction is because, in 2023, Adyen is only recognizing the net amount in the revenue, whereas in 2022, they were recognizing the full gross amount.&lt;/p&gt;

How do I go about the process of getting out of these single stocks into ETF/Index Funds? I am worried about having to pay taxes on anything I sell but is this just part of the game? Sell something, buy something else, and pay taxes on whatever gains are from the stock I sold?

What about losses? I barely know anything about tax loss harvesting.

As far as I understand, bond ETFs:

1. Hold a diverse set of bonds with different maturity dates
2. Don't hold bonds until maturity; instead, they sell bonds before maturity and buy new ones.

Now, when selling such a bond fund, there is a possibility of losing money if interest rates increase. To overcome this, there is a neat strategy: after selling my bond fund holdings, I can either:

1. Buy back all the individual bonds in the ETF and hold them until maturity (which is almost impossible to do).
2. Buy an equivalent amount of bonds with a duration that is equivalent to the average duration of the bond fund. Because the bond market is efficient, the price paid will be more or less the same as in option 1.

The problem is that buying individual bonds is not that easy for a retail investor. That's the reason I am buying a bond ETF in the first place. There are minimum requirements (like a minimum of $50k), spreads can be large, etc.

Are there any other strategies that can be used that are easier to implement?

A little leverage can be a good thing but too much can be counterproductive — you have to find the sweet spot. This cultivated my appreciation for 2x leveraged index funds such as QLD (2x NASDAQ 100) and SSO (2x S&amp;P 500).

\#3 Is J.L. Collins. I like his straightforward style, especially on how to deal with down markets.

\#4 Warren Buffet. He candidly states that it was a different ball game when he and Charlie Munger were picking stocks in the 1950's. He tells people that nowadays the lay investor should concentrate on index funds and not try to be Buffett and Munger. Smart. I like his candor in that regard.

Peter Lynch. He advocates the outmoded paradigm of picking individual stocks.

Tell me how facile it is, Peter. I bought his book many years ago and it went right back to the book store. The book is full of froth and Peter bragging on himself, about how he ""discovered"" Dunkin Donuts and Hanes. Peter actually uttered the following: ""never buy stocks that go down"". Yes, he actually said that. OK, Peter, I'll get out my Ouija board and ask it if a stock will go down. Or I might ask my magic 8-ball.

\[Very brief\]  
  
If you are long SEA I’m sure you saw the horrendous drop this morning on the news of them coming in light on revenue expectations. I personally feel like this drop is completely overblown and management’s ability to emphasize profitability and add to their cash pile over the last two quarters shows great discipline and flexibility in a changing market. They even profitably grew e-commerce by \~21% YOY and digital payment by \~50% YOY.   
  
I did a conservative sum of the parts analysis this morning where I compared SE’s three segments to comparable companies to show where a potential bottom could be and to hopefully help investors (myself) not panic sell due to this overblown move. I used P/S ratios because I don’t think EBITDA or earnings are entirely meaningful yet in the company’s current stage. **I also used a run rate for 2023 and did not assume any further growth, as to be as conservative as possible in forming the base case.**   
  
**Summary:**   
  
**Garena:**   
  
Scenario 1 - Steady State: Comparing Garena to Tencent’s P/S ratio on a 2Q23 annualized basis, so assuming no growth for the rest of 2023 but keeping the same run rate, the valuation for Garena should be \~$5.5B.   
  
Scenario 2 - P/S Comp Reduction Slashed by 50% due to Continual Decline (Ultra Conservative): Using the same assumptions as above, the value of Garena would be \~$2.7B. I believe this is ultra conservative because as we saw today, overall gaming metrics are starting to improve i.e. MAUs and % of paying users, and I think with the new title launches, should continue into future quarters.   
  
**Shopee:**   
  
Using the run rate for 2023, so again, assuming no growth, the value for Shopee is \~$14B  
  
**Sea Money:**   
  
Using the run rate for 2023, so again, assuming no growth, the value for Sea Money is \~$1.9B. I believe this is extremely conservative. I don’t think the comps (PYPL, STNE) quite capture the growth and opportunity of Sea Money due to the rapid growth and high growth region, as the P/S average used was \~2. Fintech has been under pressure recently, but historic P/S comps have ranged from 6 to 12, so if you do the math, the valuation here is much higher on a realistic basis.   
  
**Conclusion:**   
  
On a straight across basis, assuming Garena (and the other segments) keep the current run rate for the year, the valuation of the sum of the parts is \~$21B. Cutting the multiple in half for Garenas decline gives us \~$18B.   
  
That being said, these valuations assume no additional growth in the other segments, simply keeping the current run rate. That being understood, I think where it’s sitting now at $23B could be argued to be the fair price/intrinsic value, which would make sense in an efficient market.  
  
**Personal Thoughts:**  
  
It’s gut wrenching to watch a company drop like SE did today, but it’s important to table emotions and remember the game you’re playing. SE operates in a market that is going to see continual and immense growth for decades to come, well above the GDP growth % for most of the developing world. They have strong market leadership in e-commerce and even with entrants like TikTok, can still materially grow that business year over year due to low overall e-commerce market penetration.   
  
As discussed in the call, they’re also pivoting back into a growth mode for Shopee as to keep up with competitors in the region. This should boost the Shopee revenue growth rate as well as capture more sellers/buyers in the Sea Money ecosystem, providing a two-fold growth engine.   
  
I personally am going to hang tight with my 50% paper loss and wait for a lower price to add to my position (as crazy \[or not\] as that sounds). If it went any lower from current levels, especially as low as \~$18B I would see this as a clear opportunity to invest heavily, especially as the region is expected to recover in 2024 and beyond and as discussed above, I believe the gaming segment is going to continue to stabilize through the EOY.   
  
Would love to know what everyone’s thoughts are, whether long or short. GLTA.  
  
**TL;DR** \- SE is down but certainly not out. A great company that had expectations set too high in the short/medium term, but has a great growth story laid out in front of it.

&lt;p&gt;Given this logic (which might be flawed to begin with - let me know), wouldn’t it make sense for investors to allocate some portion of a portfolio to actively managed funds?

I still have to play with ending years - am I totally looking in the wrong direction?

Investors, 

I'm an American living in Korea, age 33. I'm exploring financial options like getting an index fund started through interactive brokers. (There are better ones, but these guys are the only ones accepting Korean Won into other currencies) 

In the meantime I'm also trying to invest long term in foreign bond markets, for Old Me. Due to me living out here, my options are stymied because I'm not a citizen and the Korean Won doesn't really play well with others...

I feel I shouldn't grab any Yankee Bonds because of the high interest rates, so I'm thinking about Arirang Bonds or Samurai Bonds. I haven't done much research into this, beyond a few links from investopedia. Before I invest some chips, im hoping for Second and Third opinions. 

I have a 2yr foreign savings account from won to USD with an exchange bank, it takes ₩1,000,000 every month from my income. I still have about ₩600,000 left after expenses and food. Its just coffee money, so I should do something meaningful with it. Any constructive advice is appreciated!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors, &lt;/p&gt;

I've been thinking of just putting the rest in VTI/VSUX and letting it sit(I'm 37) - I shouldn't need it until retirement, and then contributing any income above what I need to keep that emergency fund around ~40k as it comes in.

I'm a little apprehensive as I read a lot of concerns about a recession but I also understand the argument for time in the market vs timing the market.

I don't have any debt other than my mortgage and make a little over 200k.  I realize this is a pretty high income, and it might seem ridiculous asking for advice, but I am also pretty concerned about layoffs in the tech sector and a potentially long stint of unemployment if we see a 2000s style bubble bursting.

* Surprisingly the industry in the agricultural sector is leading in many new innovations like autonomous driving/automation with leaders like Deere.

From a 2022 Goldman Sachs report, ""Copper is so integral to the green transition – a global effort underpinned by government support – that the supply requirements necessitate a spike in copper prices""  
**Demand will increase**  
EVs, EV charging, electrical transmission, and renewables all use a lot of copper, and are set to grow for the foreseeable future.  
For example, an EV uses at least 2x more copper than a gas powered car.  
There also isn't a clear replacement for copper in these products, meaning the price can continue to rise without destroying demand.  
Aluminum is the most likely potential replacement, but not nearly as efficient (it would require a much higher volume of aluminum to do the same job).  
**Supply will not keep up**  
Supply is expected to fall well short of demand in the 2nd half of this decade.  
Ore grades are declining at many of the largest copper mines and there have been almost no major new discoveries in recent years.  
New copper mines can take 10 years to get up to full production, so they would not contribute to the supply equation until 2033.  
**TL;DR:** the world is going to need a lot of copper, there is no viable substitute, and the supply wont be there.  
**Disclosure:** I am long COPX, FCX, IVPAF and IE, though these do not constitute a large % of my portfolio yet.  
What are your thoughts? Am I missing anything? The most likely threat to the thesis above as far as I can see would be a breakthrough in extraction technology that dramatically increases supply.

&lt;p&gt;I see that they only have $150m AUM though. I&amp;#39;m fairly novice on all this, but I guess I&amp;#39;m just worried that there is some risk of the ETF shutting down altogether at some point? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has only been around since 2019. I&amp;#39;m 29, so I dont plan on touching this for another 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any insight much appreciated - should I be worried that this ETF might not make it that long?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like AIQ, but their all time chart is insane &amp;amp; concerning&lt;/p&gt;

Sankyo has cash and cash equivalents of 1.9 Billion Dollars and almost no debt which results in 32,7$ Cash per share.

I calculated an approximately Asset Value of 2,098 Billion Dollar which results in 36,13$ per share.

The company has a high profitmargin of 30% which speaks for its strong marketposition.
I only know about one competing company which is Fujishoji Ltd a way smaller buisness in the same segment but with smaller profitmargin and decreasing revenue while the revenue of Sankyo is increasing strongly.

They both only earn money in Japan selling panchikos but it looks like sankyo establishing a Monopoly by gaining more and more marketshare.

Also the Cashflow is increasing very strongly. I calculated an average FCF-growth rate of 35,5% over the last 7 years and used a Discountrate of 15% which seems very conservative and calculated an intrinsic value of approximately 120$ per share. The current price is 45$ so we are applying a Margin of Safety of 65%.

In conclusion for me it seems like Sankyo is very strong buisness with an almost perfect balancesheet. It is increasing its revenue and free Cashflow constantly and has a high profitmargin and ROIC it is also paying a reliable dividend of 2.7%.
I know that in times of digitalisation the use of non-digital games will decrease but panchiko is a cult game which can be found in almost every japanese street. Because of the fact that this segment is decreasing I think that the probability of new entrants is very small which makes it easier to establish a Monopoly for Sankyo.

I know the goal of SEC yield is to help compare across bond funds given varying distribution schedules, but how can it be a useful metric when it is so disconnected from the actual returns?

I have learned that the SEC yield is more like the YTM, which assumes the bonds are held to maturity. How does that result in the lower distribution yields we're seeing?

Imagine a bond fund that holds only one bond at a time. While the bond is held, the distribution yield will only consist of coupon payments, but the SEC yield is factoring in the eventual return of principal, so the SEC yield will be higher (assuming the bond was purchased at a discount). But when the bond is traded, its advancement toward maturity should be factored into the sale price and then that appreciation should be part of the next distribution, therefore over time the average distribution yield and SEC yield should match.

&lt;p&gt;I would also be interested in learning if anyone has been able to track inflation to their investments for the entire time they&amp;#39;ve held their investments (thinking of inflation as a benchmark, per se)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the Bureau of Labor Statistics data is always YoY, this doesn&amp;#39;t add insight to how inflation is for the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ETA: Another benefit of knowing the YTD inflation is that it could make it much easier to decide on which interest bearing investments to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm considering starting a 20-25 year savings bond ladder by buying 10k/year of Ibonds and 10k/year of EE bonds for the next 20 years. It would basically be for a fixed income portion of my retirement. I plan to fully retire no later than 25 years from now when I also have maximum social security benefits. The alternatives of using long term treasury bills and long term CDs is suboptimal I think because Ibonds are guaranteed to meet inflation (say 2.5% historically) and EE bonds if held 20 years the same (3.5% interest) and I expect low interest rates going forward due to government debt (they need inflation and low interest rates to keep low government debt).

# Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters

5-6 minutes  
2023-08-08  
Toby Nangle   
The writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager  
This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&amp;P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.  
With such a high proportion of a market’s value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.  
Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market’s stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.  
Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.  
In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.  
Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits — even after taking into account dividends.  
Bessembinder’s work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers — with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.  
Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies — even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region’s equity index can be something of a dark art.  
Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L’Oréal collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.  
If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It’s easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&amp;P 500 rally — Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta — might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market’s valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It’s hard to take a view on companies that don’t yet exist.  
I’ve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.  
But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets — or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known — have such a lousy record.  
The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder’s research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.

625,investing,"This is a question about managing active trading to best deal with large losses for tax benefit.  

Say I bought shares in 10 companies 2 years ago, say for $100,000, and these all tanked, and the positions sank to $30,000, but have since bounced and are now worth $60,000 (net $40,000 loss).   Say I expect their prices to imminently resume sinking again, so I want to sell now at the bounce to salvage as much as possible.  

At the same time, I don't want to realize the $40,000 loss this year because I expect to have no realized gains to claim this year to offset that loss against, and would essentially ""lose"" the loss for tax benefit purposes and be stuck only able to use $3k/yr of it against ordinary income going forward (is that right?).  And in the next year, say I plan to sell other long term profitable positions for $50,000 of realized gain, then I would be taxed on all $50k of it, with no losses that year to offset it.  

So, I would rather save the net $40,000 in losses now for the future year when I sell other positions that have large gains.  So if I sell those 10 positions now at the market bounce, can I indefinitely push off claiming this $40,000 as a realized loss by making sure to actively buy and then immediately sell the same positions at least every 4 weeks, for a couple bucks profit or loss?  This way I more or less lock in the current ""bounce"" prices of the losing positions, but not the taxable loss. 

Since I assume the basis on each position would remain high, due to the wash sales, then every time I would quickly buy and sell, whether a couple pennies up or down, would count as a disallowed loss (carrying over against that original high basis), and so continue to drag out the wash sale and high original basis, until sometime next year when I want to sell the winners, then I can finally sell the losers and simply not repurchase, and finally claim the $40k in losses to offset the realized gains. 

Is this a viable strategy to time the tax offset of selling winning and losing positions?  Is there an easier and less annoying way to do this same thing?

&lt;p&gt;Since I assume the basis on each position would remain high, due to the wash sales, then every time I would quickly buy and sell, whether a couple pennies up or down, would count as a disallowed loss (carrying over against that original high basis), and so continue to drag out the wash sale and high original basis, until sometime next year when I want to sell the winners, then I can finally sell the losers and simply not repurchase, and finally claim the $40k in losses to offset the realized gains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a viable strategy to time the tax offset of selling winning and losing positions?  Is there an easier and less annoying way to do this same thing?&lt;/p&gt;

631,investing,"First, I know it will grow into million. Compounding interest and the raising water of index funds is undeniable truth. 

My shock and disappointment is in a nuance that was never mentioned amongst friends, most forums, and lots of finance books. 

So, my situation models after a typical decent American household and would be considered extra good for rest of the world. 

I’m 32 with a Household income after taxes of 60,000$

Set aside 20% every month into a IRA &amp; Roth = 12,000/year

I plug that into a compounding calculator for 30 years with an average return of 9% (roughly a 50-100 year historical average) 

= boom 1,700,000$ 

I am rich!!!! Thank god I didn’t buy those Starbucks coffees everyday and invested it instead. 

But wait…. What’s guarantee in life: death, taxes, and inflation. 

1.7m in 30 years will not actually be 1.7m dollars today. 

Even worse, inflation compounds just as my interest on investments does. 

So an inflation calculator shows in 30 years “ This is an average inflation rate of -2.50% and cumulative inflation of -52.33%.” 

Meaning my 1.7m is actually 850,000$ when adjusted for inflation. 

Then 4% is a safe withdrawal rate of the 850k (inflation adjusted) = 34,000$ (and there will be a ~5% effective federal tax rate as married on the IRA withdrawal at least)

So my 20% saving rate(1k/m), with great 9% average returns, over 30 years with a tax deferred IRA/Roth account will result in ~2700$/m when adjusted for inflation. (Roughly half of my net income)

Now this isn’t bad, and paired with US social security, it is realistic 70-90% of my net income will be maintained in retirement. Great!

I just asked ChatGPT to give me prompts to find stocks with potential.

  
I asked it to give me a quick explanation behind each prompt too.

  
The results were pretty interesting.

  
Note: You’ll need ChatGPT Plus and have the Boolio Invest plugin enabled for these to work.

  
It took a lot of trial and error for it to come up with good prompts. Some of the prompts it came up with were cool e.g. ""Find companies with a market capitalization under $5 billion that have expanded into new geographical markets in the last 2 years."" but there was no way for ChatGPT to actually find the answer.

  
Here are the best prompts it came up with (that worked for me)

**Prompt 1**  
Prompt: ""Find stocks with a P/S ratio below the industry average, positive net income, and a dividend yield of over 2%.""  
How it works: This prompt focuses on commonly available financial metrics like P/S ratio, net income, and dividend yield, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of potential value stocks.

**Prompt 2**

Prompt: ""Search for stocks with a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio below the sector median, a positive net income for the past 3 years, and a dividend yield above 3%.""  
How it works: A P/E ratio below the sector median can indicate undervaluation. Consistent net income shows profitability, and a decent dividend yield provides income, making it a comprehensive approach to find potential value stocks.

**Prompt 3**  
Prompt: ""Search for technology stocks with a 3-year revenue growth rate above 10%.""  
How it works: This prompt targets the technology sector and focuses on revenue growth, a key indicator of potential high growth.

**Prompt 4**  
Prompt: ""Find companies with a market capitalization under $2 billion that have increased their market share in the last year.""  
How it works: This prompt looks for companies that are still small but are growing.

**Prompt 5**  
Prompt: ""List healthcare stocks with an R&amp;D expense growth of over 5% in the last year.""  
How it works: Focusing on R&amp;D expense growth in the healthcare sector can uncover innovative companies.

**Prompt 6**  
Prompt: ""Identify stocks with a consistent track record of meeting or beating earnings estimates over the last 4 quarters and a P/B ratio below the industry average.""  
How it works: Earnings estimates and P/B ratio are widely used in financial analysis. This prompt combines these factors to find stocks that may be undervalued and have strong operational performance.

**Prompt 7**  
Prompt: ""List stocks that are trading at least 20% below their 52-week high and have a Return on Equity (ROE) above the industry average.""  
How it works: Stocks trading significantly below their 52-week high may be temporarily undervalued. A higher-than-average ROE indicates that the company is generating good returns on shareholders' equity, suggesting strong management.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to come up with prompts to find stocks myself (only losers come up with ideas on their own).&lt;/p&gt;

Been a lurker on this sub for a while and really have gained so much insight from all of you on my investing journey, so shout out to you guys!

I am 27 and have a generally pretty boring portfolio with splits as follows:

1) VOO - 45%

2) VT - 40%

3) Individual stocks - 10% (lot of EV stocks since i have passion for them (especially rivian), as well as holdovers like GE, amazon, disney from investing prior to committing everything to ETFs)

4) DRIV - 5% (again, electric car nut, know its redundant, but nice to have a lot of the EV market outside of RIVN in an ETF, even if it is pretty top heavy with Google, etc.)

Know the overlap between VOO and VT, but when I started investing in ETFs, I was exclusively buying VOO. As I learned more, found out that I liked some exposure to international and small caps, but not enough to VT and chill lol. 

Recently, I have been having a strong desire to be more aggressive. I dont know if I am just falling into the trap of wanting to stray from ""boring"" investing, and end up shooting myself in the foot. 

Would love to hear from you all if I should just maintain a holding pattern, or if I am missing something important in my portfolio for somebody my age who is actually pretty risk tolerant? Appreciate you all!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, &lt;/p&gt;

""The U.S. Federal Reserve will likely need to raise interest rates further to bring down inflation, Governor Michelle Bowman said on Saturday.

Bowman said she supported the Fed's quarter-point increase in interest rates last month, given still-high inflation, strong consumer spending, a rebound in the housing market and a labor market that is helping to feed higher prices.

""I also expect that additional rate increases will likely be needed to get inflation on a path down to the FOMC’s 2 percent target,"" she said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Kansas Bankers Association, referring to the Fed's rate-setting panel, the Federal Open Market Committee.""

Data from last Friday also seems to underpin this:

Metric	Actual	(Estimate) :

* Unemployment rate: **3.5%**	 (3.6%)
* Average hourly earnings (MoM): **+0.4%**	(+0.3%)

So unemployment dropped back to 3.5% and wage growth added 0.4% which was above estimate. Keep in mind that Powell and the Fed pay alot of attention to those 2 specific metrics.

Also [Fed's own Nowcasting](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting) projects CPI +0.4% for the month of July (which is above the current estimate of 0.2%) and even **+0,6% for the month of August.**

Even with some margin of error those are both **way above 2% on annual basis** which would require on average inflation not be more than +0,17% so both July and August readings would be high above that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-bowman-says-more-us-rate-hikes-likely-will-be-needed-2023-08-05/""&gt;https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-bowman-says-more-us-rate-hikes-likely-will-be-needed-2023-08-05/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I think with a combination of stock, bond, and REITs, it’s not so difficult to get 10% yearly with max drawdown bellows 50%.

Portfolio will be something like these, (with symbols and yearly returns)

20% REITs: O 6% 

20% BDC: ARCC 10%

40% Stock: QQQ 15%, SPY 12%

20% Bond: I haven’t really looked into which bond to buy, but probably treasury with cooperation bonds around 5%-8%

It’s just a rough idea to show it seems possible and the ratio can be changed. Do you guys think it feasible? That means 30k yearly cost. 2.5 k monthly cost (including rent and everything). 

p.s Assuming one person only. I may accidentally get a family but I don’t want to make this estimation too complicated.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated, especially my portfolio. I know most people are overly confident in their ability to beat the market, so I thought better to ask here to ensure I don't overestimate myself and end up on the streets.

Equal weighting would give more weight the smaller stocks so SMB should increase.

By Noah Smith

I do not want to be a shill for the Biden administration. Yes, I like most of what Biden is doing on industrial policy. But I really want to resist being one of those center-left pundits who always just blasts out the latest press release of a Democratic administration and trumpets how many jobs the President has “created”. That sort of partisan cheerleading would be damaging to my credibility (or at least my self-respect) as an independent analyst of the economy, and it would also play into the kind of silly simplifications that the media too often uses to talk about the macroeconomy — for example, the idea that the President “creates jobs”, or is responsible for everything that happens to the economy under his watch.

And yet when I look at how the U.S. economy is doing right now, I find it difficult to describe it in terms that allow me to avoid sounding like a shill. I know lots of Americans still think the economy is doing poorly, and are upset about that. But when I look at objective measures, I just can’t rationalize that negative viewpoint. Because as far as I can tell from the actual numbers, this economy is doing really, really well.

Why the economy is doing really, really well

What do we want from the macroeconomy?

We want employment to be high, meaning that as many people as possible who want jobs can get them.

We want inflation to be low, so that people have certainty about how far their paycheck and their savings will go in the future.

We want real incomes to rise, meaning that we’re able to consume more than we could in the past, or save more if we want to.

(There’s a fourth thing we might want, which is wealth, but that’s more complicated and I’ll talk about it later.)

Basically, this is the whole list. If people have jobs, inflation is low, and real incomes are rising, the economy is good. That doesn’t mean people necessarily realize it’s good — social strife, or partisan polarization, or lingering pessimism from past disasters may cause people to be pessimistic about the economy even in the face of great data, a phenomenon some refer to as a “vibecession”. But while I acknowledge that people’s feelings are important and that there are other things that matter besides the economy, when I’m analyzing how well the macroeconomy is actually performing, I can’t go on vibes.

And when we look at the objective numbers, they are great. First of all, there’s the employment situation. Some indicators of employment, like labor-force participation, look bad because we’re in the middle of the great Baby Boom retirement. That’s why you generally shouldn’t use measures of the labor force that don’t adjust for age! When we do adjust for age, we find that the U.S. job market is now the best that it’s been in recorded history. Here’s the employment rate — i.e. the percentage of Americans who have a job — adjusted for age:

https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab8bdbf8-7696-4c14-b516-f1babc5b19b8_791x533.jpeg

This shows what the employment rate would have been since 1981 if the fractions of the U.S. population in each age group were the same as in February 2020, right before the pandemic. Basically, we have a much older population today than we used to, and this is a way to try to take that into account. Now you can say “Well, if the labor market of 2023 were as good as 1999, then old people would be working a lot more in 2023 than they did back in 1999.” And maybe that’s true, but if so, there’s not really much way to tell. The assumption that aging works about the same in 2023 as it worked in 1999 seems like a good one. And even if the reality is a little bit off from that assumption, we’re still pretty damn near the best labor market ever.

Next up we have inflation. This has, of course, been the big problem since the start of 2021. But now inflation is plunging; if it’s not back to its target, it’s headed there very rapidly. In month-to-month terms, PCE inflation (which the Fed likes better than the more commonly used CPI) is now below the 2% target.

https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb08b3c8c-ac2a-417b-958b-3254f4efec64_1318x450.png

Slower-moving measures are all headed downward. Broader measures are falling rapidly as well. And when you include the rents that people are paying on new leases instead of rents for leases signed long ago, inflation looks even lower. Meanwhile, market inflation expectations, measured by the 5-year breakeven, increasingly look like they’ve been completely tamed, which means people think the Fed has inflation under control in the long term:

While the portfolio allocation propsed above has historically generated near or above stock market level performance while taking significantly less risk (which is a good thing), one of my concerns for your account is to reposition the assets to a more tax-efficient allocation.  One of the ways to achieve this is in a taxable account using ETF’s for stock-oriented investments as opposed to mutual funds.  Mutual funds are required to pay out to shareholders and capital gain distributions from mutual funds which result in a taxable event.  Over the past two years your  account has generated taxable capital gain distributions of $8,000- $10,000 annually.  ETFs and individual stocks do not have to follow the same tax rules that apply to mutual funds, and therefore instead of paying out capital gain distributions to shareholders, they take the gains generated by the sale of stocks and just purchase more stocks.  Since the capital gain distribution is not paid out to you the result is avoidance of taxation.    
 
The value of a couple stock oriented investments in your account have increased in value so if we were to sell the shares of those investments to rebalance  it would result in a capital gain of approximately $11,000± for 2023 taxes, but then going forward we no longer have those annual tax burdens.

712,investing,"Hi all,

After lurking for many years watching the markets make crazy returns, a few weeks back I put my life savings + an old 401k into ETF’s and a few individual stocks. $100k in the ind bene account and $47k in the rollover IRA. Current total value of $147,000. 

I wanted to sell a few days ago when my account was up $6700 and of course I didn’t and the recent dip has happened and has dropped to leave me barely in the green +$700. I know the timeline for investing is supposed to be 20+ years but I’ve been in the camp of everything is extremely overvalued and I don’t want to watch my money dip 30-40% in the short term. 

I’m 37.. my 401k and wife’s 403b are maxed yearly with another 170k in those accounts and I will never touch those no matter the dips in market. My thought has always been that these will be our true retirement accounts and the other money is just a big savings pot. 


So my question is… Do I… 

A. Just stay the course and leave all my money in the investments? And cry when a big dip happens. 

B. Pull the $100k out of Ind Bene account and tuck into safer HYSA to sit on sidelines another few months while collecting a boring 5%. (While leaving the $47k rollover invested into ETF’s)

C. Buy a property I’ve been looking at for $180k-$200k. Would require all my $100k + a $80k loan. 


I like the idea of the property because even if it dips short term, it’s still mine. It -should- also increase in value over time due to its location near a major city (Houston). BUT, I know by doing this I’m potentially leaving tons of money on the table by not staying with option A if markets continue their 6-10% average returns year after year.

I’ve been looking into ETFs &amp; mutual funds but to my understanding unless you’re investing large sums of money these investments don’t grow very fast.

*From Bailey Schulz USA Today 8/4/23*  
  
Which jobs are most at-risk due to AI?  
  
U.S. jobs likely to have *high, medium and low exposure* to AI include:  
  
**High exposure:**  
  
Budget analysts  
  
Data entry keyers  
  
Tax preparers  
  
Technical writers  
  
Web developers  
  
**Medium exposure:**  
  
Chief executives  
  
Veterinarians  
  
Interior designers  
  
Fundraisers  
  
Sales managers  
  
**Low exposure:**  
  
Barbers  
  
Child care workers  
  
Dishwashers  
  
Firefighters  
  
Pipelayers  
  
In sum, about 19% of U.S. workers were in jobs most exposed to AI last year, while an even greater share (23%) had jobs considered least exposed.    
  
It's not clear how many jobs will be displaced by AI. A March report from Goldman Sachs found AI could substitute up to 25% of current work, with about two-thirds of jobs exposed to ""some degree"" of automation.  
  
But researchers note that displacements following the emergence of new technology have typically been offset by the creation of new jobs, with census data suggesting that about 60% of workers today are employed in jobs that didn't exist in 1940.  
  
Which employees are most at risk?  
  
Pew found that women, Asian, college-educated and higher-paid workers are more exposed to AI.   
  
Kochhar said this is because of the types of jobs held by different demographics: men tend to hold more jobs requiring physical labor like construction, for instance.  
  
""So at the moment, they have less exposure to AI,"" Kochhar said. ""Which is not to say AI could not lead to smarter robots that can do it all, also. That's not something we looked into.""  
  
According to the report:  
  
Workers with a bachelor’s degree (27%) are more likely than those with only a high school diploma (12%) to hold a job with the most exposure to AI.  
  
Women (21%) are more likely than men (17%) to have jobs with the most exposure to AI.  
  
Black (15%) and Hispanic (13%) workers are less exposed than Asian (24%) and white (20%) workers.   
  
Workers in the most exposed jobs last year earned $33 per hour on average, while jobs with the least amount of exposure earned $20 per hour.  
  
Despite warnings from AI company executives that the technology will take away jobs, many workers – especially those with jobs considered highly exposed to AI – are optimistic about AI's impact.  
  
Thirty-two percent of information and technology workers ‒ who work in an industry that is considered more exposed to AI ‒ say the technology will help more than hurt them compared with 11% who believe the opposite.   
  
Meanwhile, 14% of workers in hospitality, services and arts – a “less exposed” industry – think AI will help more than hurt. A greater share (17%) believe it's more likely to hurt them.  
  
""Where AI has penetrated at the moment, workers are finding it being more useful than hurtful or businesses are applying in what that is benefiting workers as opposed to replacing workers,"" Kochhar said.  
  
Overall, 16% of U.S. adults said they think AI will help more than hurt, while 15% said they thought it would hurt more than help. Thirty percent say it will help and hurt equally, and 32% said they were unsure.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High exposure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budget analysts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data entry keyers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tax preparers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical writers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web developers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medium exposure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief executives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veterinarians&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interior designers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundraisers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales managers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low exposure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Child care workers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dishwashers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firefighters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pipelayers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, about 19% of U.S. workers were in jobs most exposed to AI last year, while an even greater share (23%) had jobs considered least exposed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not clear how many jobs will be displaced by AI. A March report from Goldman Sachs found AI could substitute up to 25% of current work, with about two-thirds of jobs exposed to &amp;quot;some degree&amp;quot; of automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But researchers note that displacements following the emergence of new technology have typically been offset by the creation of new jobs, with census data suggesting that about 60% of workers today are employed in jobs that didn&amp;#39;t exist in 1940.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which employees are most at risk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pew found that women, Asian, college-educated and higher-paid workers are more exposed to AI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kochhar said this is because of the types of jobs held by different demographics: men tend to hold more jobs requiring physical labor like construction, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So at the moment, they have less exposure to AI,&amp;quot; Kochhar said. &amp;quot;Which is not to say AI could not lead to smarter robots that can do it all, also. That&amp;#39;s not something we looked into.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workers with a bachelor’s degree (27%) are more likely than those with only a high school diploma (12%) to hold a job with the most exposure to AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women (21%) are more likely than men (17%) to have jobs with the most exposure to AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black (15%) and Hispanic (13%) workers are less exposed than Asian (24%) and white (20%) workers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workers in the most exposed jobs last year earned $33 per hour on average, while jobs with the least amount of exposure earned $20 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite warnings from AI company executives that the technology will take away jobs, many workers – especially those with jobs considered highly exposed to AI – are optimistic about AI&amp;#39;s impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty-two percent of information and technology workers ‒ who work in an industry that is considered more exposed to AI ‒ say the technology will help more than hurt them compared with 11% who believe the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 14% of workers in hospitality, services and arts – a “less exposed” industry – think AI will help more than hurt. A greater share (17%) believe it&amp;#39;s more likely to hurt them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where AI has penetrated at the moment, workers are finding it being more useful than hurtful or businesses are applying in what that is benefiting workers as opposed to replacing workers,&amp;quot; Kochhar said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, 16% of U.S. adults said they think AI will help more than hurt, while 15% said they thought it would hurt more than help. Thirty percent say it will help and hurt equally, and 32% said they were unsure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

724,investing,"Long post, but if you like options and making money you may find it interesting.

I've got about a $500k portolfio I'm playing with. I've had my fun gambling with options over the last 5 or 6 years, understand the concepts and general strategies, but now want to ""settle down"" and try to maximize my return with a more boring strategy. I've put a good bit of thought into it and started executing some over the last 6 months, want to lay out what I'm thinking, and see if anyone has any critiques or comments, basically see if it's as good of an idea as I think it is. For reference, about half of my portfolio is in the general ETFs (SPY, QQQ, etc), the other half in individual stocks that I like for one reason or the other.

So far I haven't really sold any covered calls on the ETFs because the premium hasn't been attractive enough. They aren't volatile enough. Feels like picking up pennies in front of a steam roller. But I have strongly considered starting to, and just rolling over indefinitely if needed. Will come back to this later in the post.

What I have been doing is waiting until some of my individual stock picks are near what I think of as near term ""peaks"" and selling covered calls on them about 10-20% OTM about 45 days out. I don't expect to get assigned, but when it's close to expiration and I would be assigned because they have turned ITM, I have just been rolling them over. I haven't been selling covered calls on stocks in my portfolio that I think are in a low point in their mid-term cycle because I don't want to limit their upside.

More on the rollovers. For example, I bought SCHW at $52, sold call on it with a $60 strike, jumped to $67 at earnings. Bought to close my call at $60, sold to open another at $62.5 with an expiry 2.5 months later for the same price per contract I bought to close my $60 call. Doing this I'm essentially making $250 for waiting 2.5 months if SCHW price stays elevated. With SCHW in particular I think I calculated that even if it goes up to $100 per share, I'm still making like 12% per year just on the rollovers not counting the initial 15% gain from 52-60, it will eventually catch up, and I'm protected from a lot of downside risk unless it just plummets because I'm holding deep ITM calls. Seems like a win-win-win?

Now the above returns are because SCHW is relatively volatile. I sold covered calls on AMZN this morning after the earnings spike because the math is similar. Back to the ETFS... I almost sold covered calls on SPY this morning too, but did the math and my rollovers look like they would only gain 5% a year, instead of the 12%+ on AMZN and SCHW. Not to mention I have to sell the initial call much closer to the money to be worth anything signficant. With a spike in the S&amp;P I could see myself being ""underwater"" and having to rollover for years limited to the sub-par 5% gains and missing out on the broader market movement.

Soo... investors that are smarter than me, does all this make sense? Is the strategy sound or am I missing something? It's probably just a typical covered call strategy, but I don't see it being talked about very much.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long post, but if you like options and making money you may find it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

I currently live in a 3 bed 2 bath house close to town. House is worth about 300k, and I owe 66k on it at 3.5% (bought in 2014 as a forclosure and fixed up ourselves). My family is growing so I'm considering buying a new house for about 500k. With interest rates what they are, the new mortgage is larger than I'd like at about 3400 including taxes (with 20% cash being put down). 

I want to keep the existing home as a long term rental. The mortgage payment on it is about $760 per month and comparable homes rent for $1800-2000 here. 

Although I make a good salary, I'm a bit uncomfortable with the risk involved in carrying a $400k mortgage (at 7%) on the new house plus a $66k mortgage in the rental. I am considering pulling my money out of my Roth and my wife's Roth to pay off the mortgage on the rental as the combined balance of those is about what we owe on the ""rental"". Our return from the Roths has been about 8.2% over the past couple years. 

I know this generally frowned upon, but paying this off would mean I have a $300,000 property generating about $1900 in cash flow each month with no debt service. And my risk would be substantially lower. My other option is to squeek by on my monthly expenses and let the mortgage be paid down over time. 

For reference, the Roths are 100% in VTSAX and I am 34 years old. I also have a 401k at work, so these are not my only retirement funds. 

Thanks in advance for the help thinking through this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

Goal is for a quick overview of the earnings report for an average person to be able to read and digest\*\*

1. Operating Activities:  
The operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showcases how Amazon generates cash from its core business operations. In both periods, the company's operating activities generated positive cash flow. There was a significant increase in net income, showing growth from a loss of $2.03 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. This highlights a remarkable improvement in Amazon's financial performance and operational efficiency.  
  
2. Investing Activities:  
Amazon invested heavily in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions during the analyzed periods. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, the company's investments in property and equipment amounted to $15.72 billion, which decreased to $11.45 billion in the same period in 2023. While the absolute values decreased, these investments are essential for the company's long-term growth and expansion.  
  
3. Financing Activities:  
The financing activities section details Amazon's capital structure and shareholder returns. The company engaged in various financing activities, including repurchasing common stock, resulting in cash outflows of $3.33 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2023, and $6 billion in the six months ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, the company obtained proceeds from short-term debt and other financing, contributing $4.87 billion and $4.4 billion in the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Investors should be aware of these activities, as they impact the company's capital allocation strategy.  
  
4. Cash Position:  
Amazon maintained a strong cash position, reflecting its financial stability and liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased steadily over the periods, reaching $50.07 billion at the end of the twelve months ending June 30, 2023. This signifies the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and pursue growth opportunities.  
  
5. Debt and Interest Payments:  
The company managed its debt obligations efficiently, making principal repayments on long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations. Amazon also paid interest on debt, with cash outflows totaling $349 million and $954 million for the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. These payments demonstrate responsible debt management and the company's commitment to meeting its financial obligations.  
  
6. Net Sales:  
Net sales are a fundamental indicator of Amazon's revenue growth and market performance. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, net sales reached $121.23 billion, which increased to $134.38 billion in the same period in 2023, representing an 11% year-over-year growth.

7. Operating Expenses:  
Operating expenses provide insights into the company's cost structure and efficiency.

Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating expenses increased from $230.69 billion to $249.29 billion, primarily due to higher fulfillment, technology, and infrastructure costs. Despite the increase, Amazon's revenue growth outpaced the rise in operating expenses, leading to improved operating income.  
  
8. Operating Income:  
Operating income measures the profitability of Amazon's core operations. The company experienced significant growth in operating income, increasing from $3.32 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to $7.68 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating income rose from $6.99 billion to $12.46 billion, indicating improved operational efficiency and profitability.  
  
9. Non-Operating Expense:  
The non-operating expense provides insights into Amazon's other income and expenses outside its core operations. Total non-operating expense decreased from ($5.97) billion to ($0.12) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. This decline was primarily due to a positive swing in other income (expense), net, indicating favorable financial management.  
  
10. Net Income (Loss):  
Net income is a critical metric that assesses Amazon's overall financial performance. The company experienced a significant improvement in net income, increasing from a loss of ($2.03) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net income increased from a loss of ($5.87) billion to a profit of $9.92 billion, demonstrating a strong financial turnaround.  
  
11. Earnings Per Share (EPS):  
Earnings per share is a vital metric for shareholders, as it represents the company's profitability on a per-share basis. Basic earnings per share increased from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.66 for the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. Diluted earnings per share showed similar growth, rising from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.65 for the same periods.  
  
12. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):  
Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items that impact the company's financial position but are not part of the net income calculation. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon's other comprehensive income was ($2.42) billion, which increased to $293 million for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, other comprehensive income was ($3.41) billion and $807 million, respectively.  
  
13. Comprehensive Income (Loss):  
Comprehensive income is the total change in equity during a period, including net income and other comprehensive income. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon reported a comprehensive loss of ($4.45) billion, which improved to a comprehensive income of $7.04 billion for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, comprehensive loss improved from ($9.28) billion to a comprehensive income of $8.33 billion, highlighting the company's financial recovery.  
  
14. Segment Information:  
Amazon operates through several segments, including North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, all segments showed significant growth in net sales.  
  
•	North America: Net sales in North America increased from $80.85 billion to $87.75 billion, representing a 9% year-over-year growth.  
•	International: Net sales in the International segment grew from $31.9 billion to $37.4 billion, reflecting a 17% year-over-year growth.  
•	AWS: Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud computing segment, experienced remarkable growth, with net sales increasing from $16.37 billion to $20.2 billion, showing a 23% year-over-year growth.  
  
Conclusion:  
Amazon demonstrated robust financial performance and growth in the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. The company's operating activities generated positive cash flow, and net sales increased consistently across all segments. Investments in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions reflect Amazon's focus on long-term growth and expansion.  
  
Although the financing activities included cash outflows related to stock repurchases, the company's strong cash position and responsible debt management position Amazon well for future growth. The substantial improvement in net income and operating income signifies improved financial performance and operational efficiency.  
  
  
  
PROs &amp; CONs:  
Pros:  
  
•	Strong Revenue Growth: Amazon has consistently demonstrated strong revenue growth across its various segments. The company's ability to expand its customer base, introduce new products and services, and leverage its e-commerce platform has led to impressive financial performance.  
•	Diversification of Business Segments: Amazon has successfully diversified its business beyond e-commerce. The expansion into cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a major growth driver, providing the company with a stable and profitable source of revenue.  
•	Innovative and Customer-Centric Approach: Amazon's relentless focus on customer satisfaction, innovative technologies like Amazon Prime, and personalized shopping experiences have helped the company build a loyal customer base and maintain a competitive edge in the market.  
•	Financial Stability and Liquidity: The company maintains a strong cash position and prudent debt management, providing it with the financial flexibility to invest in new ventures and navigate economic uncertainties.  
•	Global Reach: Amazon operates in numerous countries, allowing it to tap into diverse markets and consumer preferences worldwide. Its vast international presence positions the company for further growth and market dominance.  
•	Leading Cloud Service Provider: AWS is a dominant force in the cloud computing industry, serving a wide range of clients, from startups to large enterprises. The profitability and growth of AWS contribute significantly to Amazon's overall financial success.  
  
Cons:  
  
•	Regulatory Scrutiny: Amazon faces increasing regulatory scrutiny related to its market dominance and business practices. Antitrust concerns and accusations of unfair competition may lead to potential legal challenges and fines.  
•	Labor Practices: The company has faced criticism for its labor practices, including allegations of poor working conditions and treatment of employees at its fulfillment centers. Such negative publicity can impact Amazon's reputation and may affect its ability to attract and retain talent.  
•	Highly Competitive Markets: The e-commerce and cloud computing industries are highly competitive, with major players vying for market share. Amazon faces challenges from established competitors and emerging startups, requiring continuous investment in innovation and technology.  
•	Dependence on Global Supply Chain: Amazon's vast supply chain network is critical for delivering products to customers. Any disruptions, such as those caused by geopolitical events or natural disasters, could affect the company's operations and financial performance.  
•	Profit Margins: While Amazon experiences strong revenue growth, its profit margins have historically been relatively low. Intense competition and ongoing investments in new ventures can put pressure on the company's profitability.  
•	Environmental Impact: As a large-scale retailer and cloud services provider, Amazon's operations have an environmental impact. The company has faced criticism for its carbon footprint, and there are growing expectations from stakeholders for more significant efforts towards sustainability.  
TLDR;  
Amazon recent earnings report for the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, reveals a robust financial performance and impressive revenue growth across its segments. The company generated positive cash flow from operating activities, showing a significant increase in net income, indicating improved financial health and operational efficiency. Amazon's strategic investments in property, equipment, and acquisitions demonstrate a focus on long-term growth and expansion. With a strong cash position and responsible debt management, the company exhibits financial stability and flexibility. However, regulatory scrutiny, labor practices, and intense competition pose potential challenges. Despite these, Amazon remains a leading player in the e-commerce and cloud computing industries, presenting attractive prospects for investors seeking exposure to a market-dominant, innovative, and customer-centric company with a history of success and growth.

Additionally, the company obtained proceeds from short-term debt and other financing, contributing $4.87 billion and $4.4 billion in the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Investors should be aware of these activities, as they impact the company&amp;#39;s capital allocation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash Position:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon maintained a strong cash position, reflecting its financial stability and liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased steadily over the periods, reaching $50.07 billion at the end of the twelve months ending June 30, 2023. This signifies the company&amp;#39;s ability to meet its short-term obligations and pursue growth opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt and Interest Payments:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company managed its debt obligations efficiently, making principal repayments on long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations. Amazon also paid interest on debt, with cash outflows totaling $349 million and $954 million for the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. These payments demonstrate responsible debt management and the company&amp;#39;s commitment to meeting its financial obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Sales:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net sales are a fundamental indicator of Amazon&amp;#39;s revenue growth and market performance. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, net sales reached $121.23 billion, which increased to $134.38 billion in the same period in 2023, representing an 11% year-over-year growth. Similarly, for the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net sales grew from $237.68 billion to $261.74 billion, showing strong and consistent revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating Expenses:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating expenses provide insights into the company&amp;#39;s cost structure and efficiency. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, operating expenses were $117.92 billion, which increased to $126.70 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating expenses increased from $230.69 billion to $249.29 billion, primarily due to higher fulfillment, technology, and infrastructure costs. Despite the increase, Amazon&amp;#39;s revenue growth outpaced the rise in operating expenses, leading to improved operating income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating Income:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating income measures the profitability of Amazon&amp;#39;s core operations. The company experienced significant growth in operating income, increasing from $3.32 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to $7.68 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating income rose from $6.99 billion to $12.46 billion, indicating improved operational efficiency and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-Operating Expense:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The non-operating expense provides insights into Amazon&amp;#39;s other income and expenses outside its core operations. Total non-operating expense decreased from ($5.97) billion to ($0.12) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. This decline was primarily due to a positive swing in other income (expense), net, indicating favorable financial management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Income (Loss):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net income is a critical metric that assesses Amazon&amp;#39;s overall financial performance. The company experienced a significant improvement in net income, increasing from a loss of ($2.03) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net income increased from a loss of ($5.87) billion to a profit of $9.92 billion, demonstrating a strong financial turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings Per Share (EPS):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings per share is a vital metric for shareholders, as it represents the company&amp;#39;s profitability on a per-share basis. Basic earnings per share increased from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.66 for the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. Diluted earnings per share showed similar growth, rising from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.65 for the same periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items that impact the company&amp;#39;s financial position but are not part of the net income calculation. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon&amp;#39;s other comprehensive income was ($2.42) billion, which increased to $293 million for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, other comprehensive income was ($3.41) billion and $807 million, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive Income (Loss):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive income is the total change in equity during a period, including net income and other comprehensive income. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon reported a comprehensive loss of ($4.45) billion, which improved to a comprehensive income of $7.04 billion for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, comprehensive loss improved from ($9.28) billion to a comprehensive income of $8.33 billion, highlighting the company&amp;#39;s financial recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Segment Information:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon operates through several segments, including North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, all segments showed significant growth in net sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• North America: Net sales in North America increased from $80.85 billion to $87.75 billion, representing a 9% year-over-year growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• International: Net sales in the International segment grew from $31.9 billion to $37.4 billion, reflecting a 17% year-over-year growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• AWS: Amazon Web Services, the company&amp;#39;s cloud computing segment, experienced remarkable growth, with net sales increasing from $16.37 billion to $20.2 billion, showing a 23% year-over-year growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon demonstrated robust financial performance and growth in the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. The company&amp;#39;s operating activities generated positive cash flow, and net sales increased consistently across all segments. Investments in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions reflect Amazon&amp;#39;s focus on long-term growth and expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the financing activities included cash outflows related to stock repurchases, the company&amp;#39;s strong cash position and responsible debt management position Amazon well for future growth. The substantial improvement in net income and operating income signifies improved financial performance and operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PROs &amp;amp; CONs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Strong Revenue Growth: Amazon has consistently demonstrated strong revenue growth across its various segments. The company&amp;#39;s ability to expand its customer base, introduce new products and services, and leverage its e-commerce platform has led to impressive financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Diversification of Business Segments: Amazon has successfully diversified its business beyond e-commerce. The expansion into cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a major growth driver, providing the company with a stable and profitable source of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Innovative and Customer-Centric Approach: Amazon&amp;#39;s relentless focus on customer satisfaction, innovative technologies like Amazon Prime, and personalized shopping experiences have helped the company build a loyal customer base and maintain a competitive edge in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Financial Stability and Liquidity: The company maintains a strong cash position and prudent debt management, providing it with the financial flexibility to invest in new ventures and navigate economic uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Global Reach: Amazon operates in numerous countries, allowing it to tap into diverse markets and consumer preferences worldwide. Its vast international presence positions the company for further growth and market dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Leading Cloud Service Provider: AWS is a dominant force in the cloud computing industry, serving a wide range of clients, from startups to large enterprises. The profitability and growth of AWS contribute significantly to Amazon&amp;#39;s overall financial success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Regulatory Scrutiny: Amazon faces increasing regulatory scrutiny related to its market dominance and business practices. Antitrust concerns and accusations of unfair competition may lead to potential legal challenges and fines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Labor Practices: The company has faced criticism for its labor practices, including allegations of poor working conditions and treatment of employees at its fulfillment centers. Such negative publicity can impact Amazon&amp;#39;s reputation and may affect its ability to attract and retain talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Highly Competitive Markets: The e-commerce and cloud computing industries are highly competitive, with major players vying for market share. Amazon faces challenges from established competitors and emerging startups, requiring continuous investment in innovation and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Dependence on Global Supply Chain: Amazon&amp;#39;s vast supply chain network is critical for delivering products to customers. Any disruptions, such as those caused by geopolitical events or natural disasters, could affect the company&amp;#39;s operations and financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Profit Margins: While Amazon experiences strong revenue growth, its profit margins have historically been relatively low. Intense competition and ongoing investments in new ventures can put pressure on the company&amp;#39;s profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Environmental Impact: As a large-scale retailer and cloud services provider, Amazon&amp;#39;s operations have an environmental impact. The company has faced criticism for its carbon footprint, and there are growing expectations from stakeholders for more significant efforts towards sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon recent earnings report for the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, reveals a robust financial performance and impressive revenue growth across its segments. The company generated positive cash flow from operating activities, showing a significant increase in net income, indicating improved financial health and operational efficiency. Amazon&amp;#39;s strategic investments in property, equipment, and acquisitions demonstrate a focus on long-term growth and expansion. With a strong cash position and responsible debt management, the company exhibits financial stability and flexibility. However, regulatory scrutiny, labor practices, and intense competition pose potential challenges. Despite these, Amazon remains a leading player in the e-commerce and cloud computing industries, presenting attractive prospects for investors seeking exposure to a market-dominant, innovative, and customer-centric company with a history of success and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

TL;DR Does having more investors than ever before and faster opportunities for companies to grow account for the “outrageous multiples” we see?

I believe the average PE of the S&amp;P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don’t need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

With that in mind, I can’t help but think about the amount of new money that’s been brought in in the last 20 years as ease of access to investing, as well as financial savvy has grown. I mean look at the market cap of the US market here:

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

Are we just in a new norm as a result of these things? I’m not saying the market isn’t overvalued but is it AS overvalued as analysts think or should we be adjusting our baselines?

767,investing,"I saved up about a six month emergency fund which I have sitting in a money market account. But as I've started to accumulate more money in a market index fund I have been wondering if keeping any money in a money market account makes sense so long as you have enough extra in stocks. The worst that can happen is that the market goes down right when I need the emergency fund, which could certainly happen together in an economic downturn. In that case I'd essentially be paying more for using the emergency fund.

Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I'd basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. 

So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.

Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I'm not considering?

&gt;**He has the power to wipe out the entire human race. If we believe there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.**

In financial planning, this is truer than ever. So many ""30-year"" projections all make massive assumptions. That 6-months of emergency funds will be enough. That interest rates on bonds will be ""safe"" (not anymore they're not). That real-estate will appreciate. That social security will be there for you. That the government won't default etc etc.

Often, people glibly dismiss worse-case scenarios saying *""Well, if that happens, you'll have bigger things to worry about""*. No, I fucking won't! The government can default, but my first concern will be protecting my finances.

So what am I preparing for? **I don't know.** I have no idea what to prepare for.

What is my long-term horizon? I don't know

When will I retire? **I don't know**

For how long will I live? **I don't know**

How much money will I need? **I don't know**

I have no idea what will go wrong, or when.

So I thought I'll share six things I do to prepare for the worst.

**Keep $200k in Cash Equivalents**

People often recommend a ""6-month"" emergency fund. As if life's major problems will only last 6-months. What if you get disabled? What if your entire job industry vanishes, and you're unemployed for six years?

So I keep a 75/25 stock/cash portfolio allocation.

More importantly, I can't even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.

**Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only**

I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I'll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.

Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it's not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.

Always assume that you're going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.

**A Strong Value Tilt**

In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post [in defense of dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/), so I won't rehash my arguments here. I'll add only this - dividends aren't enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.

In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the [Gordon equation](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808).

**Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me**

If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don't want complications at the worst possible time.

**Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife**

A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I [posted about it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/) :) . It's not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.

But in case I'm persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can *maybe* bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.

**No House - Rent Only**

A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don't know what kind of tenants you'll get. Too much risk.

Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.

Bottom line: Always assume that everything will fall apart. If it doesn't, it's a pleasant surprise. But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a quote in Batman v Superman, where Bruce Wayne tells Alfred this about Superman:&lt;/p&gt;

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&amp;#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.

Hi everyone! I am a 26-year-old male from the Netherlands, and I am looking to start investing in the stock market. I have saved up 1000 Euros as an initial investment and plan to contribute 200 Euros per month going forward. After doing some research, I am considering investing in a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. However, I have some questions and would love to hear your thoughts and advice:

	1.	Is now a good time to step into the market, given the current economic conditions and market trends?
	2.	Considering my age and long-term investment horizon, does investing in a 2x leveraged ETF make sense, or are there other investment strategies I should consider?

I am a 26-year-old male from the Netherlands, and I am looking to start investing in the stock market. I have saved up 1000 Euros as an initial investment and plan to contribute 200 Euros per month going forward. After doing some research, I am considering investing in a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks the S&amp;amp;P 500 index.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.  Is now a good time to step into the market, given the current economic conditions and market trends?
2.  Considering my age and long-term investment horizon, does investing in a 2x leveraged ETF make sense, or are there other investment strategies I should consider?

I will use the commodity NATGAS as an example which is $2.69 (01-aug.-'23) and I use Etoro as platform.

I see that if eg. today I open a short (CFD, 1x) of $1000,- I get a weekly fee of $10.49 indefinitely as long as my position does not hit stop loss.  
I can move my stop loss to $14.8 if I add another $4000,- to my position.  
So using $5000 in total, I get $10.49\*52=$545 annually. This is more than 10%!!  
  
Now, I get that if the price of NATGAS rises, I am in ''trouble'', but not as long as it stays under my SL. I could even put the fees I receive back into my position increasing the SL further over time whilst maintaining the $545 annual fee.  
If I look at the history of NATGAS (known for more than 25 years) it never reached $15,-  
  
I know that results from the past are no guarantees for the future but still it feels like a solid way to get $545 annually! Why isn't everyone doing this then...

Interested to see if there is any research out there that could suggest active trading beats B&amp;H. 

I've done some small backtesting on a few hundred trades that I thought I had identified as non-random movements, and even still the win % only really comes out to about 54% with a 1:1 Risk reward ratio. 

Theoretically, that has positive expected value, however, due to randomness, and the win % not being high enough, you are basically jsut chopping around and maybe making a few % points here and there on the most likely run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Again, this was just some small testing I personally did but everything in my view doesn't really hold up to simple B&amp;H over the long run. 

With that being said, I was interested in seeing if there is research out there comparing buy and hold to active management / active trading over a large enough data set and if there is potentially above what you would normally get by just buying a Vanguard index fund. 

Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it's because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I've made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same.

I feel silly for even asking, but I have had money sitting in my savings account for so long, getting chewed up by inflation, and put it into these accounts, somewhat uneducated.&lt;/p&gt;

It all seems legitimate, until the email that I recieved today:

&gt; Hi Virtuix Supporter,

&gt; The chance to become a Virtuix shareholder ends next week (August 10). That’s an exciting opportunity by itself, considering how fast we’re growing. But our investors also get exclusive discounts on Omni One and are first in line to get a system. The last chance to get these perks is August 10.

They're trying to rush people to invest. Rushing people to do anything is a big red flag. Even if they're not a scam, I think their product is going to flop. No one (for VR products, 35k people on the waitlist is tiny) is going to spend $33k on a VR treadmil. Facebook's VR headset is much more trusted and popular. What do you guys think about it?

830,investing,"Hey all,
I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I'm normally an index funds kinda guy. 

My research suggests there are a few things I can do:

**Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.**

Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: 

* limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. 
* pay taxes -&gt; less to reinvest. 


**Buy protective puts**

Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren't free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. 

**Set a trailing stop loss**
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it's easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. 

So my questions are: are there other options I didn't consider?  Which of these is best if I am long term bullish on these stocks? 

If I look at protective puts, how do I structure the put? Do I set the strike price at the current price? Somewhere slightly below? Above? Significantly? What kind of experiation date should I aim for? Months years? 

Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,
I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I&amp;#39;m normally an index funds kinda guy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research suggests there are a few things I can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay taxes -&amp;gt; less to reinvest. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy protective puts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren&amp;#39;t free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a trailing stop loss&lt;/strong&gt;
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it&amp;#39;s easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. &lt;/p&gt;

 I have casually started following this sub-reddit and I was wondering if some of you could advice on what to do with my 401k.

 After working 15 years at a company A, I switched to company B in May 2023. I had started a 401k with company A and there is quite a bit of funds in it, almost 450k. After I had made the switch, I got a call from the brokerage (Fidelity) and they were asking if I would be interested in managing it. I went their office and the advisor showed me how they would convert into a traditional IRA with them managing the funds. Their fees is high (1.05%) with the % coming down as the fund grows. Fidelity would manage and maintain the fund during ups and downs, in addition they would add exposure to foreign stocks. My current 401k portfolio is basic 50% in S&amp;P500 index fund and the remaining 50% in Vanguard Target date fund.

I already started another 401k and a Roth IRA at company B. I put 50% in S&amp;P500 index fund and the rest in ContraFund K6 (Russell 1000 Growth).

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

856,investing,"I think dividend stocks are fundamentally misunderstood by the majority of investors. I (hopefully) imagine most people in r/investing already know dividend mechanics, but I often see a few common arguments on personal finance forums for dividend stocks.  


**(1)** Dividend stocks pay greater yields compared to T-Bills/bonds/GICs, which had low returns throughout the 2010s during the period of ZIRP and post-2020.  


**(2)** The income stream of dividend stocks is more “reliable” than depending on stock prices. Capital gains and losses fluctuate yearly, but dividend payouts are less variable.  


**(3)** The underlying stocks that pay dividends are thought to be more stable; most investors would consider that companies with excess cash to return in dividends, rather than invest in themselves, are in a safer financial position than growth.  


**(4)** Dividend companies are often (*and wrongly*) associated with “value”. Dividend stocks can and often do have low P/B, P/E, and often trade near book value, but this is not to say that all dividend stocks are priced in terms of value ([for example, PepsiCo at 33 P/E is equal to Apple](https://ycharts.com/companies/PEP/pe_ratio)).  


**(5)** An idea that dividends are “free money”, because you aren’t working for them. This is a very dangerous and flawed way of thinking for investments. For one, *dividends decrease retained earnings*. Two, you can still incur real losses when the underlying stock decreases more than your dividend payout. The fundamental risk-reward tradeoff exists for all investments, including dividend stocks.  


The mechanism of dividends is - at a simple level - fundamentally indifferent to selling stock; stock prices decrease exactly by the dividend payout on the ex-dividend date. [Buffett even argues](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2012ltr.pdf) that **forced dividend payouts are inferior** to letting shareholders decide their own cash-out policies from capital gain, rather than incurring immediate taxes from dividend income and purchasing stock above book value (which is why Berkshire doesn’t pay out dividends).  


Mental accounting is our tendency to sort our money into individual categories, rather than treat them homogeneously. Academics suggest that investors have a flawed mindset, so called the “*free dividend fallacy*” by Hartzmark and Solomon; investors and even mutual funds/institutions subconsciously see dividends and price decreases as fundamentally separate, despite their working knowledge. Individuals tend to treat the gains from dividends as separate from the concept of the share price, and analysts are overambitious when forecasting dividend-paying stocks (due to their negligence the fundamental link between dividends and the underlying stock).   


**Dividend demand increases during periods of low interest yields** \- which argues that investors *do* substitute the former for fixed income, despite the fact that they are **completely different asset classes**.  


*They argue that “... dividend irrelevance runs counter to intuitions from other areas of life, whereby harvesting the fruit from a tree is viewed as fundamentally different to harvesting the tree itself.*  


*”*Here is a quick exercise; remember that there are really no similarities between dividends and bonds. You cannot view the idea of cashflow of $10 from a $100 bond as equivalent to $10 from a $100 stock (which will always drop to $90). **There is no promise of dividend yield nor price security from dividends compared to bonds.** There goes the argument of dividends as a ""safe"" blend of equity and fixed income for retirement.  


I'm not sure why many people think that **dividends are earnings.**  


When a company sells down some assets, they often pay out the value as dividends, so taking only dividends is still depleting your asset base (book value of the stock decreases). Really, where the company obtains the dividend cash isn’t even relevant, whether from profit or assets - it was already part of the company’s assets.  


Companies pay out part of their income as share buybacks, so your dividends are again not representative of company earnings.  


Most importantly, **companies can pay out any amount of their earnings as dividends** (of course, even cutting them unexpectedly). The more they pay out, your retained earnings and business reinvestment, so your **expected earnings growth will be reduced by the dividend payout**. You’re not getting more of a return with a company that pays out a higher percentage of their earnings as dividends.**Dividends are not earnings.** And by not reinvesting your dividends (which is still taxed), you’re **directly drawing down** from your assets, and the **higher your dividend, the more you’re drawing down**.  


Modigliani-Miller’s dividend irrelevance theory isn’t completely applicable in real-life due to taxes (*it actually argues against dividends*), but even more so due to investor psychology. Really, this means that chasing high yields is simply increasing your inefficiency by having more of your income exposed to dividend taxation while the share price still decreases proportionally. Fundamentally, you’re still speculating on the company that pays dividends through future earnings.

A few arguments *for* dividends say that dividends are useful for companies with excess profit. Rather than potentially squandering it in unfruitful M&amp;A/investments by bad management, they would rather return the cash to shareholders (who should, in theory, be able to get greater returns through investing elsewhere). **This is without argument, a fact.**

But dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) into the same stock *doesn’t really compute*; you are both incurring more tax inefficiency by immediately realizing your gain (in the case you’re in a high-income bracket or simply don’t need the cash that year).

Saying that DRIP gives you the power of compound interest doesn’t even make sense either; DRIP or a company not paying out a dividend has the same outcome, and any asset with growth experiences compounding. It used to be hailed as a useful method of reinvestment because of commission-free purchases and at times - even discounts of around 2-3% on stock - but this is no longer relevant with modern brokerages and low trading costs. *The caveat is that it is still useful in registered accounts* (where it would be more inefficient to transfer money out rather than directly reinvest to your position).

Another stance is that dividend cashflow maintains a fixed percentage of shareholder ownership compared to selling off stock to substitute dividends; therefore reducing your ownership as a % over time. This holds no water either.Suppose you have two stocks under the condition of perpetual growth of 10%, one that pays its excess earnings in the form of dividends and the other that chooses to retain them (at the same growth rate of the company). Both are initially priced at $100. An investor who owns 1 share must sell 0.1 shares to match the first dividend payout of $10. To match the second dividend, he sells 0.091 shares (because his share price is now $110), to match the third, .083. After 50 dividends, they have 0.01031 shares left, but the share price is $9,700/share.

Eventually, your stock price approaches infinity while your shares sold per period nears 0%. Most investors likely aren’t proxy voting, so we can realistically brush aside those benefits; which are much less than that of the income tax drag you have realized on the way.

**Dividend Outperformance**  


Before you state that high-dividend yield stocks have [better returns than the S&amp;P 500 in the long run](https://www.tacitacapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/High-Dividend-Strategy-under-the-Microscope.pdf) \- which they have and may or may not do so in the future- consider that many of these companies are typically smaller in size (less than $5B) and in low-growth sectors (consumer staples/utilities/REITs). Why does this matter? Well, because of [as part of Fama/French’s 5 factor model](https://www.tacitacapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/High-Dividend-Strategy-under-the-Microscope.pdf). Historically, investing in value in-turn beat high-yield dividend strategies across global markets with higher risk adjusted returns. If that’s the case, then why not simply skip to the next best thing: value?  


**Gains are not Losses**  
Suppose that you argue that dividends are the key to keeping your investing habit stable; you enjoy seeing the consistent dividend cashflow come out of your account, leading you to continue your habit/motivation. Perhaps you are a follower prospect theory - which states that investors value gains and losses differently, with losses being more emotionally impactful. You prefer the (fairly) certain dividend, versus tracking the ups and downs of stock appreciation. Proponents of DRIP are reasonably happy in the long-term; they never perceive that dividend as entering their  “account” or “leaving” when it becomes reinvested. They see greater numbers of shares owned, less perceived losses (DCA in down periods, which reduces your average cost and subsequently your captain gain/loss).  


But what about those that don’t? Greed is a natural human instinct; there is no denying it. The implications for investing are huge; investors want to spend more now rather than save for the future. They pick and over allocate capital to income-producing assets due to a ""spend it today"" mindset, which is especially relevant if you perceive dividends as “excess” cash or spend it frivolously. In the long-term horizon, it’s likely you will miss out on substantial long-term wealth growth.  


This post is not to say that investing in dividend stocks is never a correct choice - far from so. I just wanted to address the misconceptions surrounding dividends that are spouted so often and how they're somehow a superior option.

The bottom line is your investing mindset - especially for young individuals or those with a long timeframe - should be to maximize your total returns, which is likely not in dividend-focused investments (and especially not in relation to yield chasing). If dividends are the factor that motivates you into saving more instead of traditional investing, then so be it; allocate a small portion to that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think dividend stocks are fundamentally misunderstood by the majority of investors.

&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of dividends is - at a simple level - fundamentally indifferent to selling stock; stock prices decrease exactly by the dividend payout on the ex-dividend date. &lt;a href=""https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2012ltr.pdf""&gt;Buffett even argues&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;forced dividend payouts are inferior&lt;/strong&gt; to letting shareholders decide their own cash-out policies from capital gain, rather than incurring immediate taxes from dividend income and purchasing stock above book value (which is why Berkshire doesn’t pay out dividends).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental accounting is our tendency to sort our money into individual categories, rather than treat them homogeneously. Academics suggest that investors have a flawed mindset, so called the “&lt;em&gt;free dividend fallacy&lt;/em&gt;” by Hartzmark and Solomon; investors and even mutual funds/institutions subconsciously see dividends and price decreases as fundamentally separate, despite their working knowledge. Individuals tend to treat the gains from dividends as separate from the concept of the share price, and analysts are overambitious when forecasting dividend-paying stocks (due to their negligence the fundamental link between dividends and the underlying stock).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dividend demand increases during periods of low interest yields&lt;/strong&gt; - which argues that investors &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; substitute the former for fixed income, despite the fact that they are &lt;strong&gt;completely different asset classes&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They argue that “... dividend irrelevance runs counter to intuitions from other areas of life, whereby harvesting the fruit from a tree is viewed as fundamentally different to harvesting the tree itself.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;Here is a quick exercise; remember that there are really no similarities between dividends and bonds. You cannot view the idea of cashflow of $10 from a $100 bond as equivalent to $10 from a $100 stock (which will always drop to $90). &lt;strong&gt;There is no promise of dividend yield nor price security from dividends compared to bonds.&lt;/strong&gt; There goes the argument of dividends as a &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; blend of equity and fixed income for retirement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure why many people think that &lt;strong&gt;dividends are earnings.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a company sells down some assets, they often pay out the value as dividends, so taking only dividends is still depleting your asset base (book value of the stock decreases). Really, where the company obtains the dividend cash isn’t even relevant, whether from profit or assets - it was already part of the company’s assets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies pay out part of their income as share buybacks, so your dividends are again not representative of company earnings.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, &lt;strong&gt;companies can pay out any amount of their earnings as dividends&lt;/strong&gt; (of course, even cutting them unexpectedly). The more they pay out, your retained earnings and business reinvestment, so your &lt;strong&gt;expected earnings growth will be reduced by the dividend payout&lt;/strong&gt;. You’re not getting more of a return with a company that pays out a higher percentage of their earnings as dividends.&lt;strong&gt;Dividends are not earnings.&lt;/strong&gt; And by not reinvesting your dividends (which is still taxed), you’re &lt;strong&gt;directly drawing down&lt;/strong&gt; from your assets, and the &lt;strong&gt;higher your dividend, the more you’re drawing down&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modigliani-Miller’s dividend irrelevance theory isn’t completely applicable in real-life due to taxes (&lt;em&gt;it actually argues against dividends&lt;/em&gt;), but even more so due to investor psychology. Really, this means that chasing high yields is simply increasing your inefficiency by having more of your income exposed to dividend taxation while the share price still decreases proportionally. Fundamentally, you’re still speculating on the company that pays dividends through future earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few arguments &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; dividends say that dividends are useful for companies with excess profit. Rather than potentially squandering it in unfruitful M&amp;amp;A/investments by bad management, they would rather return the cash to shareholders (who should, in theory, be able to get greater returns through investing elsewhere). &lt;strong&gt;This is without argument, a fact.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) into the same stock &lt;em&gt;doesn’t really compute&lt;/em&gt;; you are both incurring more tax inefficiency by immediately realizing your gain (in the case you’re in a high-income bracket or simply don’t need the cash that year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying that DRIP gives you the power of compound interest doesn’t even make sense either; DRIP or a company not paying out a dividend has the same outcome, and any asset with growth experiences compounding. It used to be hailed as a useful method of reinvestment because of commission-free purchases and at times - even discounts of around 2-3% on stock - but this is no longer relevant with modern brokerages and low trading costs. &lt;em&gt;The caveat is that it is still useful in registered accounts&lt;/em&gt; (where it would be more inefficient to transfer money out rather than directly reinvest to your position).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another stance is that dividend cashflow maintains a fixed percentage of shareholder ownership compared to selling off stock to substitute dividends; therefore reducing your ownership as a % over time. This holds no water either.Suppose you have two stocks under the condition of perpetual growth of 10%, one that pays its excess earnings in the form of dividends and the other that chooses to retain them (at the same growth rate of the company). Both are initially priced at $100. An investor who owns 1 share must sell 0.1 shares to match the first dividend payout of $10. To match the second dividend, he sells 0.091 shares (because his share price is now $110), to match the third, .083. After 50 dividends, they have 0.01031 shares left, but the share price is $9,700/share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, your stock price approaches infinity while your shares sold per period nears 0%. Most investors likely aren’t proxy voting, so we can realistically brush aside those benefits; which are much less than that of the income tax drag you have realized on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dividend Outperformance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you state that high-dividend yield stocks have &lt;a href=""https://www.tacitacapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/High-Dividend-Strategy-under-the-Microscope.pdf""&gt;better returns than the S&amp;amp;P 500 in the long run&lt;/a&gt; - which they have and may or may not do so in the future- consider that many of these companies are typically smaller in size (less than $5B) and in low-growth sectors (consumer staples/utilities/REITs). Why does this matter? Well, because of &lt;a href=""https://www.tacitacapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/High-Dividend-Strategy-under-the-Microscope.pdf""&gt;as part of Fama/French’s 5 factor model&lt;/a&gt;. Historically, investing in value in-turn beat high-yield dividend strategies across global markets with higher risk adjusted returns. If that’s the case, then why not simply skip to the next best thing: value?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gains are not Losses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Suppose that you argue that dividends are the key to keeping your investing habit stable; you enjoy seeing the consistent dividend cashflow come out of your account, leading you to continue your habit/motivation. Perhaps you are a follower prospect theory - which states that investors value gains and losses differently, with losses being more emotionally impactful. You prefer the (fairly) certain dividend, versus tracking the ups and downs of stock appreciation. Proponents of DRIP are reasonably happy in the long-term; they never perceive that dividend as entering their  “account” or “leaving” when it becomes reinvested. They see greater numbers of shares owned, less perceived losses (DCA in down periods, which reduces your average cost and subsequently your captain gain/loss).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about those that don’t? Greed is a natural human instinct; there is no denying it. The implications for investing are huge; investors want to spend more now rather than save for the future. They pick and over allocate capital to income-producing assets due to a &amp;quot;spend it today&amp;quot; mindset, which is especially relevant if you perceive dividends as “excess” cash or spend it frivolously. In the long-term horizon, it’s likely you will miss out on substantial long-term wealth growth.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is not to say that investing in dividend stocks is never a correct choice - far from so. I just wanted to address the misconceptions surrounding dividends that are spouted so often and how they&amp;#39;re somehow a superior option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is your investing mindset - especially for young individuals or those with a long timeframe - should be to maximize your total returns, which is likely not in dividend-focused investments (and especially not in relation to yield chasing). If dividends are the factor that motivates you into saving more instead of traditional investing, then so be it; allocate a small portion to that.&lt;/p&gt;

861,investing,"There has been a lot of movement in markets in the last year, and it is time for an update. 

Stocks have shot up and are now much less attractive. After selling off for most of 2022, bonds have levelled off, but the yield curve remains strongly inverted, making T-bills more attractive than long duration bonds. Commodities have been selling off, have found a floor, and are pulling up, and as such are more attractive now. 

I'm now recommending commodities for a significant portion of your portfolio, if you have a high risk tolerance, followed by T-bills, followed by stocks, until they lose their momentum.

My analysis (which I keep updated) is here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing)

If you have a different quantitative leading indicator that you prefer, I'd be interested in trying it out.

**I use the following predictors / valuation measures:**

*Stocks:*

Jesse Livermore's Average Investor Equity Allocation (AIEA) has the best performance that I’ve found.

Briefly, AIEA is (Stocks Owned) / (Stocks + Bonds + Cash Owned) by the entire market. It can be thought of as a slow-moving fear/greed indicator, where higher values are greedy and lower values are fearful.

AIEA is discussed here: [https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/](https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/), and the raw data is available here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis).

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.87 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 1.29 +/- 2.5%.

Note that with this very low expected return and recent history, this looks like a classic bubble echo: [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Stages\_of\_a\_bubble.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Stages_of_a_bubble.png). We are in the Return to ""normal"" after the Bull Trap. I suspect that the stock market break down after inflation returns or GDP collapses. The more out-of-whack this valuation gets, the less it will take to pop.

*Bonds:*

The mechanism used for the model is that the bonds held are traded each month for new bonds at the new interest rate. This takes into account the effect of changing interest rates on the value of bonds held, but not taxes or fees. Coupon payments are reinvested. The given interest rate for the current ten year bond is a good (though not perfect) predictor for what the ten year return will be. The data comes from [http://www.econ.yale.edu/\~shiller/data/ie\_data.xls](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls)

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.86 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 4.07 +/- 2.0%

With the treasury yield curve being strongly inverted ([https://www.ustreasuryyieldcurve.com/b/7TLKAL](https://www.ustreasuryyieldcurve.com/b/7TLKAL)), you are not compensated for the significant inflation risk of buying long duration bonds. I recommend 2-6 month T-bills, which are currently yielding around 5.5%.

*Commodities:*

The best predictor that I found was GSCI/GDP. GSCI is S&amp;P’s commodity index, with records back to 1970 here: [https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gsci](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gsci). GDP is the U.S. gross domestic product, with data here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP). This implies that there is a natural level of investment in commodities, compared to GDP.

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.63 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 14.95 +/- 10%. The high uncertainty here is largely because the correlation got markedly worse in 2005, around the time of global financial crisis. Commodities suffered a bubble and pop, with a peak in June of 2008. In addition to the demand fluctuation related to the global financial crisis, this was the time that massive oil and natural gas investment was occurring, which ended up crashing the prices until recently.

WTI Oil has an extremely hard resistance at $67, caused by the Saudis and the Americans defending the price (and possibly the Chinese), and has recently broken upwards out of its downward trend. As such, it looks very promising. However, because of the significant uncertainty in my quantitative analysis, I wouldn't recommend going all in in commodities.

**Back testing:**

I worked out an optimal back tested strategy ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing) \-&gt; Data sheet, toward the right). With this I find the following CAGRs, from January, 1970 to January, 2023.

Stocks only: 10.45%

Bonds only: 6.78%

Commodities only: 6.90%

Stock and Bonds: 12.21%

Stocks and Commodities and Bonds: 16.42%.

For each of these, I use the indicators from three months prior to the current date. This happens to give better results, as well as being possible without a time machine. I switch the entire portfolio to the best investment once a month, using the following procedure:

&amp;#x200B;

    if(stock return &gt; bond return + 0.8%) {
       if (stock return &gt; commodity return - 13.8%) {
          buy stocks
       } else {
          buy commodities
       }
    
    } else { 
        if (bond return &gt; commodity return + 0.5%) {
           buy bonds
       } else {
           buy commodities
       }
    }     

Predicted stock return = -0.65 \* AIEA+0.328

Predicted bond return = 0.0107 \* GS10 - 00161.

Predicted commodity return =  - 0.593 \* GSCI/GDP  + 0.226

Currently, this procedure recommends commodities.

**Actual Results:**

I've been doing this long enough, and posting about it to reddit long enough, that I can start to have a verified track record, as opposed to back testing only. This only includes what I posted to reddit, not what I've actually done with my portfolio, which is significantly more complicated and impossible to prove.

*March 2021, recommended stocks* [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/meu01j/bonds\_vs\_stocks\_and\_short\_term\_returns\_now\_is\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/meu01j/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_not/)

This is the default case, so no comment

*July 2021, recommended bonds* [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds\_vs\_stocks\_and\_short\_term\_returns\_now\_is\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_the/)

This performed much worse than I expected. I was correct that stocks were in danger. I made the faulty assumption that bonds are low risk. The combination of very low initial interest rates and the surprise (to me) very high inflation caused the worst bond sell off in US history. I did not see this coming.

*April 2022, recommended commodities* [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u64m1i/stocks\_vs\_bonds\_vs\_commodities/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u64m1i/stocks_vs_bonds_vs_commodities/)

This performed okay, I guess. But the recommendation was late (after Russian invaded Ukraine).

*October 2022, recommended stocks*
[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/yeigcu/stocks\_vs\_bonds\_vs\_commodities\_time\_to\_get\_more/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/yeigcu/stocks_vs_bonds_vs_commodities_time_to_get_more/)

My timing here was impeccable, and much better than most of the professionals that I follow.

In the table ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing) \-&gt; Reddit record), I'm shifting the dates one month later, to avoid any hint of look ahead bias.

Following my recommendations would have lead an account to rise from 100 to 102. Doing stocks alone would rise to 112. Bonds alone would fall to 86. Commodities alone would risen from 100 to 142. So my practical, reddit return is mediocre, primarily because of how badly I whiffed on the bonds recommendation. There was also some chasing the last good thing, with commodities. Using my current rules in a back test, the account would have risen from 100 to 144 (and been almost completely commodities till now).

**Warnings**

* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.
* AIEA measures a natural level for stock vs bond ownership. This is not a fundamental parameter, with an underlying theory about why the natural level should be where it is, or will remain the same in the future.
* Though GSCI/GDP feels like it could be fundamental parameter, it leaves out important phenomena, like the changing structure of the economy, as well as paradigm shifts in commodity extraction technology.
* I don't take into account taxes or other transaction costs.
* My analysis starts in 1970, because that is when the commodities data becomes available. This is a smaller data set than I ‘d like.
* I’m using the S&amp;P 500, 10 year US treasuries, and GSCI because they have long data sets, not because I consider them to be optimal investments.
* GSCI is dominated by the price of oil, like how the S&amp;P is dominated by a small number of mega tech companies, but even more so.
* My verifiable track record currently under performs VOO and chill.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of movement in markets in the last year, and it is time for an update. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My analysis (which I keep updated) is here: &lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing""&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a different quantitative leading indicator that you prefer, I&amp;#39;d be interested in trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I use the following predictors / valuation measures:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stocks:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse Livermore&amp;#39;s Average Investor Equity Allocation (AIEA) has the best performance that I’ve found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly, AIEA is (Stocks Owned) / (Stocks + Bonds + Cash Owned) by the entire market. It can be thought of as a slow-moving fear/greed indicator, where higher values are greedy and lower values are fearful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AIEA is discussed here: &lt;a href=""https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/""&gt;https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/&lt;/a&gt;, and the raw data is available here: &lt;a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis""&gt;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find a historical R^2 of 0.87 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 1.29 +/- 2.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that with this very low expected return and recent history, this looks like a classic bubble echo: &lt;a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Stages_of_a_bubble.png""&gt;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Stages_of_a_bubble.png&lt;/a&gt;. We are in the Return to &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; after the Bull Trap. I suspect that the stock market break down after inflation returns or GDP collapses. The more out-of-whack this valuation gets, the less it will take to pop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonds:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanism used for the model is that the bonds held are traded each month for new bonds at the new interest rate. This takes into account the effect of changing interest rates on the value of bonds held, but not taxes or fees. Coupon payments are reinvested. The given interest rate for the current ten year bond is a good (though not perfect) predictor for what the ten year return will be. The data comes from &lt;a href=""http://www.econ.yale.edu/%7Eshiller/data/ie_data.xls""&gt;http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find a historical R^2 of 0.86 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 4.07 +/- 2.0%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the treasury yield curve being strongly inverted (&lt;a href=""https://www.ustreasuryyieldcurve.com/b/7TLKAL""&gt;https://www.ustreasuryyieldcurve.com/b/7TLKAL&lt;/a&gt;), you are not compensated for the significant inflation risk of buying long duration bonds. I recommend 2-6 month T-bills, which are currently yielding around 5.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commodities:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best predictor that I found was GSCI/GDP. GSCI is S&amp;amp;P’s commodity index, with records back to 1970 here: &lt;a href=""https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gsci""&gt;https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gsci&lt;/a&gt;. GDP is the U.S. gross domestic product, with data here: &lt;a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP""&gt;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP&lt;/a&gt;. This implies that there is a natural level of investment in commodities, compared to GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find a historical R^2 of 0.63 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 14.95 +/- 10%. The high uncertainty here is largely because the correlation got markedly worse in 2005, around the time of global financial crisis. Commodities suffered a bubble and pop, with a peak in June of 2008. In addition to the demand fluctuation related to the global financial crisis, this was the time that massive oil and natural gas investment was occurring, which ended up crashing the prices until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WTI Oil has an extremely hard resistance at $67, caused by the Saudis and the Americans defending the price (and possibly the Chinese), and has recently broken upwards out of its downward trend. As such, it looks very promising. However, because of the significant uncertainty in my quantitative analysis, I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend going all in in commodities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back testing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked out an optimal back tested strategy (&lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing""&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; Data sheet, toward the right). With this I find the following CAGRs, from January, 1970 to January, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks only: 10.45%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonds only: 6.78%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commodities only: 6.90%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stock and Bonds: 12.21%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks and Commodities and Bonds: 16.42%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each of these, I use the indicators from three months prior to the current date. This happens to give better results, as well as being possible without a time machine. I switch the entire portfolio to the best investment once a month, using the following procedure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(stock return &amp;gt; bond return + 0.8%) {
   if (stock return &amp;gt; commodity return - 13.8%) {
      buy stocks
   } else {
      buy commodities
   }

} else { 
    if (bond return &amp;gt; commodity return + 0.5%) {
       buy bonds
   } else {
       buy commodities
   }
}     
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predicted stock return = -0.65 * AIEA+0.328&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predicted bond return = 0.0107 * GS10 - 00161.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predicted commodity return =  - 0.593 * GSCI/GDP  + 0.226&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, this procedure recommends commodities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actual Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been doing this long enough, and posting about it to reddit long enough, that I can start to have a verified track record, as opposed to back testing only. This only includes what I posted to reddit, not what I&amp;#39;ve actually done with my portfolio, which is significantly more complicated and impossible to prove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;March 2021, recommended stocks&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/meu01j/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_not/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/meu01j/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_not/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the default case, so no comment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;July 2021, recommended bonds&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_the/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_the/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This performed much worse than I expected. I was correct that stocks were in danger. I made the faulty assumption that bonds are low risk. The combination of very low initial interest rates and the surprise (to me) very high inflation caused the worst bond sell off in US history. I did not see this coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;April 2022, recommended commodities&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u64m1i/stocks_vs_bonds_vs_commodities/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u64m1i/stocks_vs_bonds_vs_commodities/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This performed okay, I guess. But the recommendation was late (after Russian invaded Ukraine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;October 2022, recommended stocks&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/yeigcu/stocks_vs_bonds_vs_commodities_time_to_get_more/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/yeigcu/stocks_vs_bonds_vs_commodities_time_to_get_more/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My timing here was impeccable, and much better than most of the professionals that I follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the table (&lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing""&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; Reddit record), I&amp;#39;m shifting the dates one month later, to avoid any hint of look ahead bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following my recommendations would have lead an account to rise from 100 to 102. Doing stocks alone would rise to 112. Bonds alone would fall to 86. Commodities alone would risen from 100 to 142. So my practical, reddit return is mediocre, primarily because of how badly I whiffed on the bonds recommendation. There was also some chasing the last good thing, with commodities. Using my current rules in a back test, the account would have risen from 100 to 144 (and been almost completely commodities till now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AIEA measures a natural level for stock vs bond ownership. This is not a fundamental parameter, with an underlying theory about why the natural level should be where it is, or will remain the same in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though GSCI/GDP feels like it could be fundamental parameter, it leaves out important phenomena, like the changing structure of the economy, as well as paradigm shifts in commodity extraction technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t take into account taxes or other transaction costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My analysis starts in 1970, because that is when the commodities data becomes available. This is a smaller data set than I ‘d like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m using the S&amp;amp;P 500, 10 year US treasuries, and GSCI because they have long data sets, not because I consider them to be optimal investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GSCI is dominated by the price of oil, like how the S&amp;amp;P is dominated by a small number of mega tech companies, but even more so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My verifiable track record currently under performs VOO and chill.&lt;/li&gt;

863,investing,"TLDR: Swapping from Edward Jones to Schwab and looking for traditional IRA and other recommendations. \*Apologies for the following novel!

  
Hey folks, I am looking for some strategic advice. I started investing three years ago when I finished active-duty military service. My wife and I stupidly didn’t save or invest any money during my 20 years of service, so no IRAs or TSP starting off. We collectively were living paycheck-to-paycheck during my military service based on terrible spending habits.

  
In 2021 we sold a house which netted us around $150k. We bought another (at 2.499 interest) but put very little down because we used our VA loan and I wanted to feel the security of having cash on hand. We have kept the rest of the proceeds in the breakdown below. Not really knowing what I was doing, I opened accounts with Edward Jones and started throwing money at it. We were able to open the Roth's based on my income then, but have since become ineligible to add to those due to high income. Also, we bought all of the individual stocks and watched them plummet in 2022, but they have since recovered and we are basically back where we started.

  
Fast-forward to now, we still spend what I consider a ridiculous amount of money every month, but we are working to correct it and double-down on investing for retirement. I started working with a great company that does a 5% match with John Hancock, and I am maxing that contribution every year (about $20k) with 75% into RFHTX and 25% into the 500 Index Fund. I am not looking to change that allocation unless folks have a compelling recommendation. Additionally, we have roughly $5k/month that is unused (saved) and put in our normal bank savings account which is really giving us no return, about 60 dollars a month, so not really sure what to do there… I should note that I plan to work for at least the next 15-20 years and expect my current income level to remain static or increase.  


So my questions are:   
\-	As we are moving into Schwab, what index funds or ETFs would make the most sense for the Roth IRAs?  
\-	Should we be maxing out Traditional IRAs with the intent to do a backdoor conversion later?   
\-	What should be done with the cash that we have in our bank’s low-interest savings account?  
\-	Are we on track or do I need to make some drastic move like taking savings and paying off vehicles / dropping the savings into my mortgage to reduce it / other?  
  
One thought I have is to make the transition to Schwab and put the Roth’s/529s into whatever the advisor recommends. Then liquidating the $50,000 in individual stocks from EJ, put that money into a MMF with Schwab and use that money to fund Traditional IRAs for my wife and I. Would this be a smart move?  
  
Below are some of our financial stats:  
Age: 44 – seeking to retire between 60-65 y.o.

888,investing,"Hi guys,

I am wondering if any of you have long/short portfolios (similar to hedge funds) and have some success with it. 

I have decent knowledge on investing/trading in general but never paid attention to hedging out market risk when building a portfolio, but I am quite interested in creating something like this as a side portfolio.

My thought is; i am going 200% long and 100% short (so double the long exposure compared to short) and instead of going short individual stocks, I am going short the market ETF (in my case DAX, Germany) and I will go long individual stocks (anywhere from 5 to 10). Since I have some experience in short term trading I am quite okay at predicting next 3 mnths out for small listed companies so I am planning to recycles these shares into new ones probably every earnings release.

I know hedge funds use sophisticated models to rebalance, have the right position sizes etc, I know I am limited (in terms of knowledge but also resources) to do this so I will keep it simple and try to position size based on the beta of the stock (past year) and volatility (measured last 200days). I will basically compare these to the overall market and position size accordingly. After that I basically multiply this value by 2x since this is a 2/1 portfolio.

Also correlations... this one is hard to get my head around since I want to be hedged when the market goes down so my mind would think I need to have low correlations but on the other hand why even hedge if you have low correlation since there would be no market risk then right? Anyway, I will try and keep correlations below .5 (so between my longs, but also my longs compared to short DAX etf)

My thought is that since I am not managing billions like hedge funds I somehow have better edge since I can get better prices.

Am I on the right track doing something like this or am I completely off? Just curious :)

Every other place besides Robinhood I've seen requires you to move money between a savings and brokerage account to take advantage of interest rates.  Hopefully there are alternatives besides Robinhood?  Looking for a good web / desktop interface.

Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

898,investing,"My LLC puts aside money from business income into a business savings account to pay taxes each year, and I have decided that rather than the funds sitting in a low-interest business savings account to invest in the market so that it earns a bit more on the capital. I've bought AAPL and MSFT, and I'm not worried that the share price will drop so much that I will lose money and not be able to pay my LLC taxes when they are due. My question is when I sell the shares next year to pay LLC taxes, if I only sell enough to recoup my original investment, and leave the profit earned in the market, am I off the hook for capital gains taxes or some other penalty? So, say I put $10k in the market, and it goes to $12k, and then in April I sell $10k worth to pay taxes and leave the 2K profit in the market long-term, what are the tax implications? I will likely hold the shares for less than a year. TIA.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My LLC puts aside money from business income into a business savings account to pay taxes each year, and I have decided that rather than the funds sitting in a low-interest business savings account to invest in the market so that it earns a bit more on the capital.
