3,investing,"46yo. I would like to hope that I have 15 maybe 20 years Max to go before retirement. I've been reading up on the rule of 100, or 110/120 nowadays and have been wondering. With the rule referring to stocks and bonds mostly, would ETF's fall in the middle? 

I'm thinking of restructuring my investments, I only have around 14 Grand currently in my ira and have only started investing more regularly within the last couple years, we add about $600 a month to the portfolio. I have a pension through work so this is currently a liquid account in case I need it, and for additional passive income when I retire.

I feel as though I have a little too many stocks at this point and I have learned the danger of having too many (VZ heavy from before the recent dip). I'd like to think that I'm not too old for growth stock still but at the same time I don't want to take too many big risks. I have been leaning towards putting more into ETFs since I believe there is less of a swing with them but there is still a little risk and they're not as safe as bonds or HYSA's. 

I will have to reply to myself since I cannot add a picture and I'm not sure if I'll be able to add a picture in my reply so I might have to put a link to a screenshot of my current holdings. Before judgment is passed yes I know I'm very heavy in VZ and SIRI. Both have a little sentimental value, however once SIRI it's around 7.5 again I plan on selling and once I recoup some of my losses in VZ I might do the same, this is long term. 

What are your thoughts on a restructuring with more ETF's and maybe only keep 10-20 in stocks and the rest in ETF's? How would that fit into the rule?

I deposited about $1500 into my brokerage and $500 into my Roth so I have a little over $2000 as my total balance, but my performance returns are about negative $500 when in reality I did not lose this much.  I also looked at the gains and losses of the ETFs that I bought and none of them have such a drastic loss that I have about -$500 in performance returns.

What I own:
My own home, which I may or may not stay in forever

My old home which has a value of ~$280,000 and I owe $30,000 on it. 

Mortgage has gone up significantly because of the value increase 

Total with tax and ins. at a 4% interest rate is $840 a month. The rent tenants pay now is $1300. Potential for rent if improvements are made is around $1800. Kitchen needs to be replaced.

So I am writing my MSc thesis in finance and I am looking for the constituents of the MSCI Europe Index.

MSCI has a data explorer platform but I am not familiar with it and I do not know how to use it. But I guess I could find it somewhere there.

I am wondering if this information is available for the public.

Sorry in advance on formatting, I’m writing this on my phone. 

My wife (28F) and I (35M) are going to be diversifying from apple and would love your opinions. I will give a brief background about us and also our financial situation. 

My wife is finishing her masters program in the spring of 24 and will be making about 100k a year. She will have about 70k in student debt. I am in tech and earn about 175-250k with zero debt. We have 1 daughter who is 3 years old. We live in a HCOL area in Northern California and fortunately have a paid off residence. 

The allocations below are held in a trust which took a 90k loss last year and gives us the opportunity to reduce allocation % in apple. Essentially we will be selling 90,000 in capital gains (roughly 690+ shares) and diversifying. 

(Trust)
Apple shares - 3,250 ($572,975)
Shwab CD - $125,000 (4.1% &amp; expiring in October 2023) 
Cash - 14.5k

Personal brokerage 
Apple shares - 620 ($109,306)
Nvidia shares - 15 ($6,720
Tesla - 10 ($2,670)
529 account - ($4,000)
VTI - $22,420 (Roth ira)
401k - $101,000 (VTSAX)
Cash - 35k

Our Schwab advisor is pushing for a self directed index through Schwab. The Schwab advisor  wants us to harvest losses in the future so we can diversify apple to even out the allocations. Minimum investment amount is 100k into this self directed index fund. Our longLong term goal is wanting to have a 10-15% allocation in apple. 

My question to the group is, what should my next step be? I’m a little skeptical about a self directed index fund because it’s a Schwab robo advisor with .4% fees. Should i just sell 75% of the entire trust and VTI or VOO it? We are very fortunate to be in this situation but are losing sleep at night with everything in 1 stock. 

Thank you in advance!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, &lt;/p&gt;

Cash - 35k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Schwab advisor is pushing for a self directed index through Schwab. The Schwab advisor  wants us to harvest losses in the future so we can diversify apple to even out the allocations. Minimum investment amount is 100k into this self directed index fund. Our longLong term goal is wanting to have a 10-15% allocation in apple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question to the group is, what should my next step be? I’m a little skeptical about a self directed index fund because it’s a Schwab robo advisor with .4% fees. Should i just sell 75% of the entire trust and VTI or VOO it? We are very fortunate to be in this situation but are losing sleep at night with everything in 1 stock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

Wanted to see your guys thoughts on potentially starting a small position at this moment. Right now PENN has one of the lower P/E Ratios in its industry. Its profit/Revenue has been pretty good (obviously taking a little hit due to everything happening). Its has highs of around $120 and its current around $23 so its been hit pretty hard and has an intrinsic value of around $36. It looks like to me that whenever the casino industry comes back to life that PENN should be in a position to have some nice returns.

55,investing,"I am a large holder in $sq and have never seen such an improving business with such a dissociated stock price. 

When $sq was $52 in 2018, it’s revenue was $750m a quarter, or $3b a year. It has since 8xed it’s revenue, and is now doing $5.5b a quarter (2x it’s YEARLY REVENUE in 2018) or $22b revenue a year. Same exact stock price, dropping lower as we speak and hitting new 52 week lows.

This would be somewhat reasonable if SQ was showing negative growth (even then it wouldn’t be justified) but here’s why I think it should be a lot higher. 

1.) BTC in 2018 was $3.3k, cashapp has been offering BTC sales since Jan. 2018, today the price is $27k, so an 8x increase. This doesn’t even include the amount of users they’ve grown using the service.

2.) BNPL is on fire. As the recessions looms consumers are taking on debt to fuel their habits, great for Square’s afterpay and afterpay is hitting new revenue highs. Affirms stock price is crushing it while square slips to new lows.

3.) Monster Cash-app growth. In 2018, Square’s Cash-app was doing 400M in revenue a year, it is now doing 12 BILLION a year in revenue, with 3B of that being GROSS PROFIT. A 30X or 3000% revenue increase! 

4.) Square Terminals: In 2018, Square terminal revenue was $300m a year. Today, it’s 1.5-1.7b. A 500-600% increase 

5.) Unlike other growth stocks, it did not grow off the hands of the pandemic. An example of this would be Fiverr or Etsy, clearly it’s growth stems from people trying to make money at home. Squares growth is organic, while a lot of other growth stocks are superficial.

6.) As the recession looms, consumers will slowly flock away from everything that damages their wealth. With cashapp you can send money and not have to worry about chargebacks (like PayPal) and it’s completely free. 

Before anyone comments, I know the company has diluted shareholders but every company does this and when you configure it into actual percentages it’s a lot lower than other companies since the market cap of $sq is so high.

Tl;Dr Since 2018, Squares stock price has been the same but all biggest lines of it’s business have improved revenue between 400-4000%.

OXY is my largest holding, with a market cap of  58 Billion, it is massively undervalued. This is my investment thesis and I am interested if anyone else has concluded the same.

Stay with me….

A few years ago Berkshire Hathaway purchased Pilot Flying J, the largest network of interstate diesel pumps in the US. Bill Gates exited the board of Berkshire. Then over the last 2 years Berkshire has built a 25% position in OXY. 

Early this year Gates himself visited Joe Manchin to lobby (successfully)  for Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Buried in it is a unique 45q direct pay tax credit. Essentially the companies that sequester CO2 will be paid directly from the IRS $180 per ton, for 12 years. After it’s passage, OXY immediately began construction of the worlds largest DAC project. Capable of sequestering one million tons per year. Then the DOE granted a billion dollars in grant funding for carbon capture. OXY received half. They turned around immediately and purchase Gate’s Carbon Engineering. 

But the planned DAC facilities are not for sequestration in the long run.  Rather, and this is my theory, they are using gov funds to subsidize the build out of Global e-fuel production network. This is why Berkshire has taken such large positions in OXY and Pilot. Cars will go electric, truck will stay diesel, but it will be produced from the air, not pulled from the ground. And Occidental Petroleum will dominate selling a “green” drop in solution for truckers worldwide.

&lt;li&gt;How old are you? What country do you live in?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you employed/making income? How much?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

77,investing,"I am looking to retire early in 2 years at age 40.

I'll have 600k in taxable brokerage that I need to last 15-20 years at a fixed $30k inflation adjusted withdrawal rate. I understand this is larger than the recommended 4%, but after 20 years then I can pull from some of my tax advantage accounts where I'll be at a safer withdrawal rate. I also plan to Roth IRA convert in this period of low taxation and if SHTF I can always go back to work as well, which is why I am taking this risk.

Ideally I'd like to avoid early withdrawal penalties on my tax advantaged accounts, but in order to do that I need to hedge against sequence of returns risk while also still allowing enough growth to support a 5% withdrawal.

My plan; **65% VOO, 10% AVUV, 25% BND**.

**No international?**

I do not think the US will under-performed the international market - opinions can be adjusted if I see it fit.

**Why large cap?**

I invested heavy into VOO and I can't just convert it to VTI and pay the capital gains taxes, nor do I think VTI vs VOO is that much different. I think medium and small cap add volatility and I'd like to have more control over that.

**Why small cap value?**

I think with the high CAPE ratio, I am forecasting may see a period where value stocks outperforms growth like in years before the latest bull market, which is why I wanted some value.; so that is where AVUV (small cap value) comes in where I pick up small cap and I add some value to help with sequence-of-returns, this also helps my portfolio get away from being so tech heavy (VOO) and more into finance where I think there is value but also growth potential.

**Why 25% bonds?**

Monte carlo suggest this much bond allocation is ideal for my needs of needing a 5% withdrawal but hedging sequence of returns.

When/if the market is down in the early years I plan to sell BND for more VOO to ride the uptick when it eventually comes.

&lt;p&gt;I invested heavy into VOO and I can&amp;#39;t just convert it to VTI and pay the capital gains taxes, nor do I think VTI vs VOO is that much different. I think medium and small cap add volatility and I&amp;#39;d like to have more control over that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why small cap value?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think with the high CAPE ratio, I am forecasting may see a period where value stocks outperforms growth like in years before the latest bull market, which is why I wanted some value.; so that is where AVUV (small cap value) comes in where I pick up small cap and I add some value to help with sequence-of-returns, this also helps my portfolio get away from being so tech heavy (VOO) and more into finance where I think there is value but also growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why 25% bonds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monte carlo suggest this much bond allocation is ideal for my needs of needing a 5% withdrawal but hedging sequence of returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When/if the market is down in the early years I plan to sell BND for more VOO to ride the uptick when it eventually comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your opinions/advice on my strategy and allocation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not my strategy for all 20 years, as my opinions/markets may change, but it is what I am attempting to get passed the initial sequence of returns risk.&lt;/p&gt;

83,investing,"Coke or Pepsi? These two companies have dominated the soft drinks industry for over a century. Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. A famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that some argue they have shaped modern marketing. Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, it's hard to say that today. Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.

So, which company is the better investment choice? We all know that Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, making up almost 7% of his portfolio. Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead? 

[Historically, Pepsi's total return has been higher than Coca Cola's.](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) That's been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let's take a look at the latest earnings. 

# Latest Earnings

At the end of July, [Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%,](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. Meanwhile, [Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6% and revenue estimates by 2.7%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi's stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then. 

# Valuation Metrics

Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. [Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), whereas [Pepsi stands at 24](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke's 9.6.

# Margins

The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. [Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) than [Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D)which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola's margins are more stable than Pepsi's, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that's a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.

# Capital Structure

The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of \~$250B and debts of \~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B).

However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke's $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it's nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.

Since that's the case, let's look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. [Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi's outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, [Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi's stock price has been doing better than Coke. 

# Dividends 

Coke does have a [better dividend of 3.2%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that's not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don't see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there's just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster. 

That's exactly what we see with Pepsi. [Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), that's true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke's at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list. Pepsi's payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don't think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%.

At this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but they are almost identical. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it's raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.

# Technical Analysis

Now, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can't really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi's price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn't closed below it. I think that's a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn't been doing too well. It's down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola's price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we've see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola's price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.

# Price Targets

My personal valuation models put Coca Cola's fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that's somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. [The Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.

On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That's a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi's free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That's why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can't say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. [Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.

# Final Verdict

Now, what's the verdict here? To me, it looks like the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I'm not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don't have any positions in either of these and I don't think I'll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%.

That's my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?

In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that some argue they have shaped modern marketing. Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, it&amp;#39;s hard to say that today. Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, which company is the better investment choice? We all know that Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, making up almost 7% of his portfolio. Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Historically, Pepsi&amp;#39;s total return has been higher than Coca Cola&amp;#39;s.&lt;/a&gt; That&amp;#39;s been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let&amp;#39;s take a look at the latest earnings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Latest Earnings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of July, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%,&lt;/a&gt; but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6% and revenue estimates by 2.7%&lt;/a&gt; while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi&amp;#39;s stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Valuation Metrics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22&lt;/a&gt;, whereas &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi stands at 24&lt;/a&gt;. However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke&amp;#39;s 9.6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Margins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi&lt;/a&gt;which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola&amp;#39;s margins are more stable than Pepsi&amp;#39;s, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that&amp;#39;s a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Capital Structure&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of ~$250B and debts of ~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke&amp;#39;s $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it&amp;#39;s nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that&amp;#39;s the case, let&amp;#39;s look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases&lt;/a&gt; (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi&amp;#39;s outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares&lt;/a&gt;. Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi&amp;#39;s stock price has been doing better than Coke. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dividends&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coke does have a &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;better dividend of 3.2%&lt;/a&gt;. Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that&amp;#39;s not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don&amp;#39;t see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there&amp;#39;s just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s exactly what we see with Pepsi. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;#39;s true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke&amp;#39;s at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list. Pepsi&amp;#39;s payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don&amp;#39;t think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but they are almost identical. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it&amp;#39;s raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Technical Analysis&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can&amp;#39;t really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi&amp;#39;s price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn&amp;#39;t closed below it. I think that&amp;#39;s a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn&amp;#39;t been doing too well. It&amp;#39;s down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola&amp;#39;s price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we&amp;#39;ve see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola&amp;#39;s price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Price Targets&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal valuation models put Coca Cola&amp;#39;s fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that&amp;#39;s somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;The Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars&lt;/a&gt; and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That&amp;#39;s a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi&amp;#39;s free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That&amp;#39;s why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can&amp;#39;t say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi&lt;/a&gt; with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Final Verdict&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what&amp;#39;s the verdict here? To me, it looks like the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I&amp;#39;m not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don&amp;#39;t have any positions in either of these and I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR; Pepsi looks better technically, Coke has a better valuation, but neither are really at a good price point for new entrants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

90,investing,"I stumbled on this overlooked post of mine from 3 years ago where I made some predictions about the financial markets based on the conditions at the time.  I decided to look back to see how they turned out.

Basically I was making the case that stocks were a good deal even though they appeared overpriced based on the CAPE index since bonds and gold were much more overpriced. 

Here’s how the predictions turned out.

Prediction: Stocks are not overpriced on a relative basis/still a good investment:

Result: Nasdaq has averaged around an +8.1% annually in the past 3 years

Prediction: Gold is not a good investment because of the historically high gold to platinum ratio at the time.

Results: Gold returned -5.9% annually

Prediction: Bonds are overpriced / not a good investment

Results: Bonds have been the biggest loser in the past 3 years. Not sure exactly what metric to show on this but in 2022 alone 30 year US treasuries lost 39.2% of their market value.  The total bond index lost 13% in 2022.

Here’s a good reference index: Vanguard total bond market index VBMFX  annual return -7.1%

Overall: pretty accurate!  Just wish I zeroed in more on real estate as the winning option!

But as I started to learn more and more about investing, I got introduced to factor investing and tilting and realised after learning that a small cap value tilt might actually be better than the initial percentage division I had. However, I do understand that many YouTubers/finance experts online advocate more for the large cap growth as an agressive mode of investment than a small proportion of them advocating small cap value. 


I'm just curious if my thought process in this decision makes sense: I buy 40% VOO as a broad index. I buy 10% Large cap growth in order to not miss out on the performance gains right now in the market. I buy 15% small and mid cap for slight tilt and 15% small cap value tilt as they perform the best in long term according to theory. The remaining 20 I use it for international with 10% of it for emerging and 10% of it for developed ex US. 


This way I'm thinking I could get exposure to what's in the peak right now(large cap growth) and use a best theoretical performer(small caps and small cap value) and also diversify with international so during us recession my portfolio doesn't go to 0. 


Btw, I have specifically avoided large value also because they have more dividend advantage which I cannot fully grasp being in a non US country which taxes dividends. Searching small cap growth has just given me bad results all over the internet so I'm skeptical of that too.

I'm an Underwriter and am very concerned about consumer loan defaults when student loans come due in October.

I am an underwriter at a small credit union, would love to hear how other institutions have been handling federal student loan borrowers over the last few years. 

My institution has been counting the payment as $0.00 per month during the pause, but obviously these will come due soon. If you're in banking, has your bank/credit union been calculating their normal payment, or have you also been putting it as $0.00?

I am concerned with liquidity. We have been giving out loans like candy at very high rates. Once borrowers start having to pay $400 (national avg) to their student loans again, I am concerned we will begin to see a large wave of defaults on auto loans and repossessions and foreclosures, as so many people paid exorbitant prices the last 3 years, when they otherwise wouldn't have been approved that much with an active student loan payment. 

My director doesn't seem concerned, but to me, mathematically, it's gotta be a ticking timebomb. Thoughts? I think I want to short the banks, but I don't see anyone talking about it other than saying money will get tight for people. You can't repossess a student loan, and if the wave of defaults starts, and again I believe it... almost *has* to, then.... big crash of the banks and consolidation like post-'08. I'll probably lose my job.

I'm not a smart investor. But I know income, outcome, assets, and liabilities - and the math doesn't math.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m an Underwriter and am very concerned about consumer loan defaults when student loans come due in October.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m in my mid 20s, and I’ve been investing for 2.5ish years. I began to run into investing subreddits recently and have become aware that I’m missing the mark with a lot of what I’m doing.

- Schwab Intelligent Portfolio
    - 70% stocks (FNDX, SCHX, FNDE, FNDA, FNDF, VOO, etc), 20% fixed income (SCHI, VMBS, SCHR, etc), 2% commodities (IAU), 8% cash
    - Do I just pull out of this portfolio? I’ve heard plenty of redditors mention it’s holding you back because of the cash percentage. Also, I don’t believe it’s the best investment strategy long term. If I do pull out and sell my investments here, while I’m at a loss, do I get taxed still? Not entirely sure how selling works because I haven’t sold anything since I started

- Schwab Personal Brokerage
    - Started this before the intelligent portfolio, and I still have some investments here. Ironically, this portfolio has consistently been doing better than the intelligent one.

- Roth IRA
    - Started investing into my Roth IRA this year. I don’t quite think I’ll max it out this year, but my plan is to do so going forward. I made the mistake of not understanding it, and it hasn’t been invested into anything since I began it months ago.
    - What do I invest my money here in? VTI/VOO? Something else? Also, am I allowed to transfer money from my brokerage accounts to my Roth IRA? I can probably max this year if I do that. 

- 401k
    - invested all in Vanguard target 2060. Should I keep this or change what I’m doing?
    - I will not max this either, but I will maybe increase my contributions to it going forward

- Regular savings account
    - Have saved about 5-6 months worth of expenses in case of emergency

I probably have 4% of my money in Roth IRA, 47% in brokerage accounts, 31% in 401k, 18% in savings account. I have a feeling I’m not doing this well, and I would appreciate more experienced investors to help me get on the right track.

&lt;p&gt;Should I avoid companies with negative cash flow? &lt;/p&gt;

I'm a bit clueless on the nature of corporate bonds which are not convertible into equity. Why would an individual pursue an investment in senior notes which are yielding below government securities?

I've been doing this a long time and have a substantial retirement portfolio built up in an IRA.

There is some potential (maybe 50/50) that my company will lay me off inside a year.  If I have to find a new job at this time, I will likely take a pay cut, and/or have to move to a new place.  Potentially forfeiting the 2.875% mortgage on my current house and trying to buy a new house in this insane market.

On the other hand. . .

If I invest aggressively, I could generate maybe $200k+ per year in income off the portfolio.  Some back of the envelope math says I could:

* Take out $150k per year
* Pay taxes and penalties on this withdrawal that would leave me with maybe $115k after everything
* Reinvest the other $50k into more conservative investments.
* By the time I'm actually old enough to withdraw from the account, I'd have more than $1M in conservative investments built up (assuming an 8%) rate of return.  Plus I'd have my original portfolio balance.
* I also have a pension worth about $2k a month if I take it at 57, or $3k if I wait until 62
* Social security will take a substantial hit since I'm skipping a decade+ of my most profitable working years.

Pros I see:

* I can retire at 47
* I'll have a substantial and growing retirement fund until I hit normal retirement age
* If I get laid off I don't have to sweat taking another job, possibly at a paycut and uprooting my life if I have to move

Cons I see

* There's some risk here . .  the income could drop, the value of my investments could drop.  I wouldn't lose everything, but could easily take a 20% haircut.  I see the chance of this happening as low.Also, with each passing years that goes ok, my conservative investments build, reducing the risk.  I think the biggest risk to this strategy is in the first 3 years.

If something drastic happened, I cal always go back to work, although, as noted, I'll probably take a paycut.  I have some other retirement accounts I wouldn't touch either.  As a backstop as well.

* That's a lot of money to hand over to the government in taxes (which I'd have to pay eventually anyway) and penalties (which I'm choosing to eat in exchange for not having to work for a living a decade+ early.)
* My social security would take a substantial hit from missing my most profitable years of working
* My wife works, makes about $65k, and would want to retire also.  But for various reasons this could be ok if it didn't happen for another couple years.  However, she would walk away from a pension of about $25k per year if she retires before another 6 years.  She wouldn't want to wait.

This is only a potential fall-back plan.  If my employer doesn't lay me off, I'm happy to continue working.

But if they do. . .I'm seriously considering trying this and just checking out of the workforce.

&lt;li&gt;My wife works, makes about $65k, and would want to retire also.  But for various reasons this could be ok if it didn&amp;#39;t happen for another couple years.  However, she would walk away from a pension of about $25k per year if she retires before another 6 years.  She wouldn&amp;#39;t want to wait.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only a potential fall-back plan.  If my employer doesn&amp;#39;t lay me off, I&amp;#39;m happy to continue working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if they do. . .I&amp;#39;m seriously considering trying this and just checking out of the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your question is &amp;quot;I have $10,000, what do I do?&amp;quot; or other &amp;quot;advice for my personal situation&amp;quot; questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How old are you? What country do you live in?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you employed/making income? How much?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I ran through a compound interest calculator how much I would earn if I invested £25 per month with an average annual rate of 5% over 30 years.

180,investing,"Reused Rutherford Engine Successfully Flies on 40th Mission! 

  
You read that right! On August 24 (NZST), we successfully launched our 40th Electron mission, called “We Love the Nightlife,” for Capella Space. Not only did we deliver Capella’s satellite to orbit, but we also demonstrated some significant milestones in evolving Electron into a reusable rocket. 

  
For the first time, we reused a Rutherford engine that had previously flown on our “There And Back Again” mission in May 2022. The engine worked flawlessly on its second flight as it took Electron to space. Then the first stage returned to Earth with a successful ocean splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. 

  
Hot on the heels of “We Love the Nightlife,” we’re launching another dedicated Electron launch for Capella. The ‘We Will Never Desert You’ mission is scheduled for lift-off from Launch Complex 1 as soon as 19 September. The mission will be our third launch for Capella this year – we're on a roll!

**Rise &amp; Sign: New Launch Deals Signed!**   


  
There must have been something in the air in recent weeks because we’ve announced 14 new launch deals across our Electron and HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) programs.    
**Here’s a look at what’s to come:**   
New HASTE launch for an undisclosed customer to take place at Launch Complex 2 (LC-2) in Virginia in 2024. We successfully launched our first HASTE rocket in June for Leidos on a mission called Scout’s Arrow. Learn more about HASTE! (HASTE rocket) 

  
Four new HASTE missions for Leidos under the MACH-TB program, scheduled to launch from LC-2 across 2024 and 2025.  

  
BlackSky, a leading provider of real-time geospatial intelligence and global monitoring services, which has launched on six Electron missions since 2019, signed a block buy deal for five Electron launches for their Gen-3 satellites beginning in 2024. Fun fact: BlackSky has used Electron as a launch vehicle more than any other single commercial customer!    


  
A new, double-launch deal with NASA to deliver their climate change research-focused mission, PREFIRE, is now scheduled to launch in May 2024. NASA's PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) mission will help close a gap in understanding of how much of Earth’s heat is lost to space, especially from the Arctic and Antarctica. This will be our 7th and 8th mission for NASA since 2018. (Graphic we made of 2 launches)  

  
Last but not least, we signed a deal with Japanese Earth imaging company Synspective to launch two dedicated Electron missions. Rocket Lab has been launching for Synspective since 2020 when the Company deployed the first satellite in Synspective’s synthetic aperture radar (SAR) constellation. Since that first mission, Rocket Lab has been the sole launch provider for Synspective’s StriX constellation to date, successfully deploying three StriX satellites across three dedicated Electron launches   
**Rocket Lab Wins Industry of the Year Award for Stennis Location**  
Rocket Lab received the prestigious Industry of the Year Award at the Hancock Chamber Business &amp; Industry Awards Gala in August. The annual awards recognize outstanding achievements in citizenship, industry and business in Hancock County, Mississippi.    
We opened our facility at the Stennis Space Center in 2022 and the site will be used to test the new Archimedes engines for the Neutron rocket coming in 2024.   
When we expanded our Space Systems division, we created a vertical integration strategy where we could build essential elements of a spacecraft for our own satellites and those built by others. The idea behind this was everything going to space should have a Rocket Lab logo on it!   
**Speaking of…  NASA Psyche Mission**    
NASA’s Psyche mission, which will orbit a metal-rich asteroid of the same name in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is scheduled to launch in less than 30 days on 5 October 2023!    
The spacecraft will use a huge Rocket Lab solar array that will power the spacecraft during its 4-billion-kilometer journey.

**MethaneSAT Mission**  

  
MethaneSAT, scheduled to launch no earlier than January 2024, is an Earth observation satellite that will monitor and study global methane emissions to combat climate change. We are providing multiple elements to make this mission a success including developing the Mission Operation Center, the solar panels to power the spacecraft, and the separation system that will eject the satellite to its orbit. This mission is jointly funded and operated by the Environmental Defense Fund, an American NGO, and the New Zealand Space Agency – the country’s first space science mission!    
**Neutron Update**  
Neutron, our mega constellation launcher, continues its development on schedule. We’ve now begun Stage 2 tank testing including cryogenic fill and pressure cycles to determine structural and sealing integrity and performance, hydrostat test to prove the structural integrity of the structure, domes, and hatches, and the fill, press, vent and de-tank systems and procedures among other structural tests.  
Our engineers are hard at work making Neutron a reality! Learn more about Neutron.

I have a question when it comes to investing in stocks that pay out dividends quarterly. 

Do I have to have my money invested in the stock for a certain amount of time before I am eligible to receive dividends?

For example, if the stock is to pay a dividend at the end of December. Will I be eligible to get a dividend if I invest in the stock at the end of November?   
Also, what if I sell my shares after the dividend is paid and buy again the month before the next dividend is to be paid?   
Is that a valid strategy at all?

&lt;p&gt;If your question is &amp;quot;I have $10,000, what do I do?&amp;quot; or other &amp;quot;advice for my personal situation&amp;quot; questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How old are you? What country do you live in?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you employed/making income? How much?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Even if it is anecdotal or not fully indicative of a price fluctuation.  For instance if they hypothetically pull back bonds on the 3rd Monday of the last month in a quarter or something.  I don&amp;#39;t know what patterns there are and am just trying to form a more coherent investing plan for this 10% of my portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;

206,investing,"Here is my bullish case for gold:  


**Gold as a Store of Value**  
\- Fiat currency can be printed endlessly, but gold cannot.  
\- The quantity of gold on Earth is limited, and all the gold ever mined would fit into a 20-meter cube.  
\- The purchasing power of a gram of gold is more stable than that of a dollar, which tends to decrease over time.  
\- This means that during periods of high inflation, the price of gold tends to rise, even though it experiences cycles of ups and downs.  


**Gold as a Safe Haven**  
\- Central banks stockpile gold, even though currencies are no longer officially tied to gold, it remains an effective means of building trust in a currency.  
\- When the conflict in Ukraine started, investors rushed to buy gold, causing its price to rise.  
This was not the case for stocks, which plummeted, or for currencies, which also suffered.  
\- Notably, gold has risen during the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the subprime crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic.  
\- It's important to note that gold does not generate income, unlike stocks or real estate investments.  
\- Gold primarily serves as an insurance policy, particularly effective in countries with high political or economic instability (e.g., Turkey, Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina).  


**Gold for Portfolio Diversification**  
\- Gold is also an effective way to diversify a portfolio and decouple it from financial markets. When the stock market declines, the value of gold tends to rise.  
\- Owning gold can be an effective way to shield oneself from market downturns.  
However, it's important to note that gold can also be volatile.  


**How to Invest in Gold**  
\- Buying Physical Gold: The most straightforward method is to purchase gold in the form of bars or coins. Online platforms are often the most convenient option.  
\- Buying Paper Gold: Not my favorite method to invest in gold. You can buy an ETF that tracks the price of gold (e.g., iShares Physical Gold or WisdomTree Physical Gold). Some ETFs invest in baskets of shares of gold mining and exploration companies.

Caravelle International (CACO) is a Singaporean shipping company that is listed on the NASDAQ as a foreign private issuer. That is, they don't have to file quarterly reports nor current reports. They two business segments, namely traditional shipping and a new business segment that's set to take off at the end of 2023 - wood desiccation services.

Fundamentals are good and you're paying almost nothing for it. But that's not what's important. The new wood desiccation segment is built off of an apparently revolutionary technology that reuses the ocean liner's exhaust gases to dry green wood while in voyage. Normally, wood is dried in wood drying kilns on-shore for anywhere between 60-100 dollars per cubic metre and the whole process takes around 45 days. It is expensive, a hassle in terms of logistics, slow and emits a lot of waste gases. This new technology promises to solve all of that and generate additional revenue through the collection of wood vinegar from the drying process, besides requiring only a one-time capex to be fitted onto ships with no additional ship hands needed. It is the only thesis I have for this company.

Here are the big red flags:
1. The documentation for this technology is presented in a doctoral thesis written by Dr Zhang, the CEO and founder of CACO and submitted to Universite Paris-Dauphine in 2018, of which I am unable to verify nor can I verify that Dr Zhang did attain his PhD from said university.

To the wood and shipping experts here: is such a wood desiccation technology even feasible in the first place? I'm sure this idea has been considered before.

2. IR information on their website is completely wrong. The email domain does not exist and the phone number leads to the wrong person. I tried contacting the CEO directly but no news so far.

3. It's registered as an FPI and was formed as a result of a SPAC merger.

4. Next to no information can be found on this company anywhere besides the official website.

213,investing,"Basically the title.

Objective is to day-trade in a tax sheltered account so that there are no consequences while day-trading is conducted within that tax sheltered account.

I checked, IRA, Roth IRA, 401K, it seems that all these have the requirement that any contribution in these have to come from annual income or a portion of it. The issue is there is no income this year or any previous years. Its only my savings I plan on putting in a tax sheltered account.

So with this conundrum, are there any tax sheltered accounts in which I can contribute from savings money and not income money ? Or should I set up a income from day trading / investing first, report it as income and then use that income to put it in tax sheltered accounts ? but then again I won't be able to put anymore than 6500$ of my income into these tax sheltered accounts. (can I use previous years of unused contribution so add up 6500 unused amounts from last several years ?) 

In Canada, there is a tax sheltered account called TFSA where you can contribute non-income savings money, was wondering if US has anything like it as well ?

Here’s my rough plan: 

30% VOO

30% VTI -&gt; ❗️suggested to VT

20% Fidelity SPAXX that has interest rate of ~4.97% (i assume this is default for cash sitting in Fidelity brokerage account, please correct me if i am wrong)

20% into actual stocks - im thinking about around 10-15 conpanies, candidates being tech companies like Nvidia, AMD, Amazon, Apple, Tesla and non-tech companies like Berkshire Hathaway (prob will need ~5 more good retail/nontech companies)
-&gt; ❗️suggested to be decreased, if not 0.




My goal is to hopefully go aggressive enough for 10~15% gains per year and later, put half into mortgage downpayment. -&gt; ❗️realistic annual return ~7%

My father, brother and I own a few rental properties between us, but are looking to invest more heavily in additional properties. We would like to form a partnership of sorts where we are all 1/3 owners. We are in the beginning stages of discussion, however, one of us will bring the majority of the funds at first and the other two will manage the properties. The thought is, the initial funds will come out of said main financier's self-directed IRA. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few questions regarding this approach:

\- Does the main financier need to be the sole person on the LLC?

\- Assuming all of the rent money will need to go back into the main financier's IRA?

\- If this assumption is correct, how do we break the properties out later on? Is this even possible?

Please note, we are planning to buy a few properties at first with the IRA cash and NOT take a profit outside of paying off the main financier with a mortgage ""loan"" amortization type schedule. All of the additional money left over will be applied to pay off the ""loan"" faster, as well as save for other properties.

It underperformed the SP500 over the last 3 years, probably because the recent crash in long term treasuries. But overall provided more consistent returns with a higher sharpe and smaller drawdowns.

Many of those ETFs aren't very correlated to each other, which reduces volatility.

The portfolio avoids real estate, financials and consumer discretionary because they are highly correlated with each other, and have been prone to bubble and burst cycles. Their returns are IMO less likely to be drastically improved by technology.

- VGT (technology) is high risk high return
- VDC (staples), VPU (utilities), VHT (healthcare) are more defensive
- VOX (communications) and VIS (industrials) are somewhere in between risk-wise. I still add them because they could be revolutionized further by VR/AR, social media, battery technology, robotics, superconductors, etc.
- VDE (energy) hedges against inflation and geopolitical risk.

244,investing,"In an interview on CNBC, investor Warren Buffett said the following: “In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending”. He didn't give the exact reason why this would happen. He just added: “When it happens or how or anything else, I don’t know”. Here we will give the exact reason by demonstrating one fundamental flaw that all cryptocurrencies have.

Cryptocurrencies are publicly portrayed as innovative payment systems. We constantly hear stories about their fancy features like speed, decentralization, security, immutability, and scarcity. And that these features somehow make them better or superior to the fiat payment system. But what we never hear, is that crypto systems cannot solve one fundamental problem. A problem that trumps all those fancy features. Now let's see what exactly that problem is.

In barter or commodity-based payment systems, both parties in an exchange receive either goods or services. If one traded tobacco for a haircut or a cow for gold, both parties received items that satisfy human wants and needs. However, in payment systems like fiat or crypto, there is a problem. Nemaley, only one party receives goods or services. The other party receives just system units. They receive something that cannot be used to satisfy human wants and needs. So obviously, the system that issued such units must be able to solve this problem. The fiat payment system solves it, while crypto does not. Let’s now demonstrate this.

The fiat payment system has two stages. In the first stage, the banks create the units by granting loans or purchasing government bonds. With such created units, loan or bond beneficiaries go to the market and get goods and services. So that stage is when the said problem is created. The market gives up items that can be used to satisfy wants and needs and gets only system units. The solution to this problem comes in the second stage. Namely, given that banks have loan contracts with the beneficiaries, liens on their properties and in the case of government bonds that must be repaid, this forces the beneficiaries to give goods and services back to the market. Otherwise, they would not be able to get the units to pay their debt, and they would face foreclosures on their properties. Additionally, the issued units are  recorded in the balance sheets of the banks as their liabilities. That means that if the beneficiaries default, the banks must sell foreclosed properties for the units to close the unpaid debt and in that way remove liabilities from their balance sheets. And that is how the problem is solved. That is how the market gets goods and services back.

In crypto systems, however, there is no solution to the problem. These systems have only the first stage. The market initially gets the units as trades for electricity needed to maintain the systems. Electricity is a good that can satisfy a lot of needs and wants. But once the market traded that good for the units, and trades them further for other goods and services, these units are never withdrawn from the market. There is no debt-like mechanism with pledged collaterals to ensure regular withdrawal of the units from the market and the return of goods and services. Instead, the market is stuck with the units indefinitely, or at least until the systems collapse.

The creators of crypto systems create them to have all those fancy features that we mentioned at the beginning. From the outside, these features give the appearance of superiority to the fiat payment system. But none of that solves the said problem. In the long run, the market will reject payment systems with such a fundamental flaw. People will stop giving up goods, services, or fiat units that ensure the return of goods and services, for fancy management of units in crypto systems. Nobody can satisfy their wants or needs with decentralization, immutability, or scarcity. But only with goods and services. That is why cryptocurrencies will certainly come to a bad ending.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview on CNBC, investor Warren Buffett said the following: “In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending”.

246,investing,"I've been trying to figure out why anyone just trying to get the best short term safe interest rate on otherwise idle money would invest in T-Bills rather than a money market, today in late 2023.

I have some ideas why but am I missing anything?

1. T-bills at present offer a slightly higher interest rate.
2. T-bills have no expense ratio.  My guess is that is the reason for number 1 above.
3. T-bills rate won't change during the holding period. It's set until maturity. MM fund yields fluctuate.
4. T-bills can be traded.  For a profit sometimes. Or you can hold until maturity.

While Money Market funds have these advantages:

1. MM funds are more liquid.  You can cash out any time instantly. You can even write checks on a Money Market fund.
2. MM Funds could maybe be taxed at a lower rate if held long enouht to be considered long term capital gains.
3. MM Funds don't come with commissions in your brokage account by T-bills might.  I use Fidelity.

Did I miss anything?

My goal is to just make the most interest on money I don't intend to invest in the stock market for 6 months to a year.  So I've been considering T-bills for 6m or maybe 1 year maturity.   But then I look and the MM funds in my sweep or ""core"" accounts and they yield only a little lower.

With T-bills I GUESS it's about locking in a hopefully high rate if you expect interest rates to go down soon.  But right or wrong I don't. Not in the near future anyways.  T-notes or T-Bonds for longer terms I would think would be better for locking in what you THINK are going to be higher rates than possible lower rates a few years out.

This sounds like a no brainer but it is not since most consider current and expected future earnings to be the primary driver. 

For stocks demand is driven by people's need for saving for the future and passive income with their extra savings and short term speculation for price increases. 

Fed can increase the demand on stocks by inflating money supply as they did this during Covid and government can do it by reducing the tax burden on population. 

5 years ago when valuations are high, everyone including  Warren Buffet was pointing out interest rates as the reason for high valuations. Now we have reasonable interest rates but valuations are even higher because demand is still high due to inflated money supply, lower taxes and blind speculation that stocks will always go up. As always discussed here, the recommendation for anyone invest now independent from valuations and macro economic conditions so demand is decoupled from technicals.

For stocks, especialy blue chip stocks, there is limited supply inflexible to pricing.

This is the harsh learning for me but I still think at some point, technicals will kick in but who knows when this will happen.

276,investing,"Which do you prefer, and are there any other reliable investment options to grow wealth?

Currently my portfolio is spread somewhat evenly across all 4 of these options.

Here's some random thoughts of mine from my investing journey since 2017.

**REIT**

I really like REITs because of the monthly dividend. There's just something about buying something and having it payout each month that is very desirable to me. Even knowing the returns will never be that of an individual stock win, I just *really* like the concept and consistency of the REIT. I'm tempted to dump 50% of my investments into REIT for this reason alone.

**Stocks**

As the old adage goes; Never buy an asset you don't understand. I figure that you should only buy a stock if you have a good reason, and I don't have much interest researching companies to try and find a good pick, though my mind could be changed on this if someone convinces me it's worth it.

I work in tech so I have a decent understanding of what tech companies do and I've had a few winners that I bought with *some* foresight. I bought AMD at $30 when I saw that Intel was releasing inferior processors at higher cost and trying to prevent hardware reviewers from reviewing them. I bought COIN near its bottom when I saw their stability in the wake of the crypto exchange disasters, and knowing a halving event is on the horizon (verdict is still out on this buy of course). Other stocks like ABBV have done well for me over the years, but I have absolutely no idea why because I know little about the healthcare industry. I lost some money on ABNB, and again I couldn't tell you why because I've never researched this company. I bought the stock a while back because I thought that ABNB would obsolete hotels.

On a long enough timeline, the value of any individual stock will fall to zero. So the question is, when do you sell? Seems to me that playing the individual stock game requires consistent ""maintenance"" and I wonder if it is worth the effort.

Also how much effort is worth spending on statistical analysis like P/E, market cap, volume etc.. ?

**ETF**

Safe and reliable. But it seems like *everyone* is buying these nowadays and recommending that you buy them. I've had VOO and SCHD as my main investments for a while now, and they *seem* to do well. but I can't help but wonder, If you do what everyone else is doing, how could you ever hope to perform above average? Or does it simply come down to the fact that if you are putting more into the market than the average person, you'll come out ahead with an 'average' return?

Is it possible for some kind of ETF apocalypse to happen where the market stagnates due to extreme diversification?

**Robo-investing**

On march of 2022, in the wake of the insane COVID stimulus rally, I came to the conclusion that I had no idea how to understand the market and decided to switch to Betterment. I set the risk to 'max' and started putting 50% of my investment money into Betterment and the remaining 50% into my personal brokerage split between stocks, ETF and REIT. Since then it's gotten me a 5.2% actual return with IRR at 11.2%

This investment vehicle doesn't seem much different that just buying some ETF myself, but maybe there is some happy middle-ground between overly-managed (stocks or human managed funds) and unmanaged (ETF) funds?

A major thorn in my side has been trying to understand foreign stocks vs US. Apparently there is an undulation where the U.S outperforms the rest of the world for several decades, followed by underperformance. I've bought some foreign stock ETFs but these have done poorly next to US companies. Betterment handles this automatically so I figure it's good to get some exposure here.

**Conclusion?**

Aside from derivatives and betting on crypto or individual stocks, the investment world seems like a homogeneous bowl of diversified funds. I'm kind of bored of investing and really just do it because I don't know how else to grow wealth aside from trying to get into real-estate.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which do you prefer, and are there any other reliable investment options to grow wealth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently my portfolio is spread somewhat evenly across all 4 of these options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s some random thoughts of mine from my investing journey since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like REITs because of the monthly dividend. There&amp;#39;s just something about buying something and having it payout each month that is very desirable to me. Even knowing the returns will never be that of an individual stock win, I just &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like the concept and consistency of the REIT. I&amp;#39;m tempted to dump 50% of my investments into REIT for this reason alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the old adage goes; Never buy an asset you don&amp;#39;t understand. I figure that you should only buy a stock if you have a good reason, and I don&amp;#39;t have much interest researching companies to try and find a good pick, though my mind could be changed on this if someone convinces me it&amp;#39;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in tech so I have a decent understanding of what tech companies do and I&amp;#39;ve had a few winners that I bought with &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; foresight. I bought AMD at $30 when I saw that Intel was releasing inferior processors at higher cost and trying to prevent hardware reviewers from reviewing them. I bought COIN near its bottom when I saw their stability in the wake of the crypto exchange disasters, and knowing a halving event is on the horizon (verdict is still out on this buy of course). Other stocks like ABBV have done well for me over the years, but I have absolutely no idea why because I know little about the healthcare industry. I lost some money on ABNB, and again I couldn&amp;#39;t tell you why because I&amp;#39;ve never researched this company. I bought the stock a while back because I thought that ABNB would obsolete hotels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robinhood despite all the hate, is not going anywhere and continues to expand its services. Their roadmap looks pretty interesting. I don’t use their platform because it’s not really suited for advanced trades but that could change with a revamp.&lt;/p&gt;

I have reached a decent base for myself to build on in the market (around 15k) but now my short-term focus has shifted to rebuilding an emergency fund and cash position in case I should lose my job, go on holiday, move houses, (or another opportunity where I would benefit having easily accessible cash) etc.

I want to have around 12k in high yield savings or cash alternatives. The problem that I've found with myself is that I find it very easy to save money when buying into stocks (I don't want to weaken my portfolio+slightly more barriers to take money out) but as I don't have the best discipline with spending it takes longer for me to save when putting money into a savings account because it is so easy to access on a daily basis.

I am considering putting half of my cash into 4 week T-bills and half into a savings account in order to build my cash position to where I want it to be. Alternatively, I also have considered the option of doing the same with a bond-etf. Bond-etfs and T-bills are attractive to me because I won't be able to access this money as easily on a daily/weekly basis meaning I won't be tempted to spend it on going out vs a savings account. As far as I know I have both these options in either the US or Australian market. 

As I am still learning and I don't know much about bonds/bills, bond-etfs seems like an easy option I could buy right now but I don't know how they compare vs buying T-bills directly. It seems like there is a decent chance of having a negative return with bond-etfs but as I have a short horizon (probably about 12 months) maybe I don't have to worry too much about this.

I inherited a non-spousal traditional IRA from my parent, which is now in a Schwab Inherited IRA. They have the money invested in 14 separate ETF's / Funds. I want to sell it all and then just put all of it in SWVXX. 

I want to do this because I am in my 50's, not experienced or interested in trading at this time, and just want a safer place for the money to live while having liquidity. I do not want to pay an investment advisor to do this. 

The Schwab trade page is intimidating. Is there a simple way to sell everything? When I reviewed an order I was going to place, I selected ""sell all"" (of one fund), and selected ""market"" in the drop down. The current market value is $3,500 but the estimated sale price was only $1,700, so I canceled it. 

I tried this same procedure with another fund. Market value is $35,000 and it would give me about $34,700. These funds are nearly all a little in the red so this made sense, but the first one I tried does not make sense to me.

I have recently sold a business and received a 7-figure windfall.  Most money I’ve ever had in my life by a long shot - and I’m trying to quickly educate myself on how to not only keep it but grow it and pass on generational wealth to my young sons.  My strategy is to allocate a roughly 50-50 split between public and private placements.  My public allocations have been deployed into ETFs and I am currently interviewing fund managers to determine the best private allocations.  

But herein lies my question for you investment wizards: should I wait a little longer before pulling the trigger on the private side and locking my money up for a significant amount of time and see what is coming down the pike for the US (and global) economy?  It seems the Oracle of Omaha and others are bearish on the near future of the stock market so wondering if I should wait to potentially buy stocks at a deep discount if the US economy and world economy enter into a deep recession.  

I know trying to time the market is a fool’s game but since I have this large chunk of cash sitting on the sidelines making 5-ish% in a money market, I’m probably as liquid as I’ll ever be so wondering what you guys and gals would do if you were in my shoes.

* After contacting CS again, they said they could only temporarily escalate the issue and journal the shares for a day. (meaning I had to execute the sale same day).

1. Unable to withdraw from Questwealth portfolio

* There is not easy way to withdraw everything from Questwealth (ie. no ""withdraw all"" button/option)
* They would not let me liquidate all assets in the portfolio and sit as cash, thus you simply have to guess at the portfolio value to withdraw everything
* After initiating a withdrawal and providing my banking details, they could not deposit the funds because I did not provide a void cheque (I have never known any banks to ask for a signed void cheque to DEPOSIT into an account, only for withdrawal)
* This ended up the account liquidating the assets then re-purchasing the shares at a higher price when the deposit did not go through.

1. Instant deposit is not actually instant

* I tried to fund an account via instant deposit. I thought it would be instant (hence the name), but after completing the transfer, it said ""funds are ready to invest after 1-2 days"" and I could not see the balance in the account.
* I then transferred more money using the ""slower"" pre-authorized payment method. They money came in much faster.
* After contacting CS, they said they could not even see the instant deposit transfer and asked for proof of deposit via a receipt. After providing the receipt, they said it would take ANOTHER 2-3 business days.

* All of their CS reps are always nice and all, however, I feel they have no idea what they are doing. They don't seem knowledgeable about the important things.

&lt;p&gt;I want to invest those 55k usd in the SP500 and add $300 monthly, I’m below 30 and in my taxes are included my retirement funds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a good move? I’m missing something? I don’t mind to wait years, I don’t need that money in the near future, I’m not scared of market going down (coming from crypto I lived a -75% twice)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never invested in stocks before, is ok to invest only in Sp500?&lt;/p&gt;

In New Zealand, we do not have a capital gains tax, meaning investing within New Zealand doesn't incur tax on gains from selling shares as long as it doesn't fall under being a trader, rather than an investor.

Although there is no capital gains tax here, there are pseudo capital gains tax, and the FIF (Foreign Investment Fund) tax is one of those. It has 2 components: the tax on dividends exceeding 200NZD a year and capital gains off stocks where the investor CONTRIBUTED $50,000NZD in overseas assets. This only includes what the investor puts in, not accounting for increase in stock price.

I am employed by a company that is originally from the US, BUT operating in New Zealand as a New Zealand branch of that company (more accurate an ANZ or Australia/New Zealand branch). They have an ESPP program which allows the purchase of their stocks at a 5% discount, taken from your after-tax pay. Contribution % ranges from 3%-15%, letting you choose anywhere between that.

* Berkshire Hathaway is the 7th largest market capitalization, behind Nvidia, with a valuation of $790 billion. (In comparison, BlackRock, well-known to the general public, has a market capitalization of $105 billion.)
* Berkshire Hathaway achieved $302 billion in revenue in 2022, a 9.37% increase from 2021.
* BH has over $73 billion in cash reserves.
* It holds stakes in companies like Coca Cola, Bank of America, and notably Apple, of which they own over 5%. It is basically an ETF (without dividends)

  
Warren Buffett is one of the world's best fund managers. He has some basic principles that we should all use:

* Invest only in businesses you understand, with favorable long-term prospects, led by competent management, and at reasonable prices.
* Look for a long-term competitive advantage in a stable industry.
* Seek exceptional companies at reasonable prices, not mediocre companies at bargain prices.  


  
The Risks I see:  


* The company's past performance has been incredible, but its current size will inevitably slow down its performance. 
* Warren Buffet is 93 years old. What is going to happen to BH when he die ? Even that seems ok: It's known that Howard Buffet will be the future Chairman and Greg Abel the future CEO when Warren is no longer around. Greg Abel shares the same basic principles of management and investment as Warren Buffett.
* Lastly, Warren Buffet is not exposed to Green and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) topics.

&lt;li&gt;Seek exceptional companies at reasonable prices, not mediocre companies at bargain prices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Risks I see:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company&amp;#39;s past performance has been incredible, but its current size will inevitably slow down its performance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren Buffet is 93 years old. What is going to happen to BH when he die ? Even that seems ok: It&amp;#39;s known that Howard Buffet will be the future Chairman and Greg Abel the future CEO when Warren is no longer around. Greg Abel shares the same basic principles of management and investment as Warren Buffett.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, Warren Buffet is not exposed to Green and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) topics. Some consider him outdated in this regard.&lt;/li&gt;

Mid 30s, looking to retire when I am due. I actually like my job. Savings totalling 300K. Leaving 100K aside for a near-future house downpayment.

I currently have 200K on 4-mo T-bills until I come up with a proper plan for that money. I see that long-term bonds yields are getting into a sweet spot &gt;4%. One of the possibilities I am contemplating is putting 50% of the capital on 30 yr bonds and the other 50% on VTI/VOO.

Rationale:

* I can probably lock in a 4.3 % yield annually.
* Maturity reached about the time I'll retire
* The bonds generate semiannual interest that I'll reinvest. Either on other bonds or ETFs.
* Assuming the interest can generate 3% interest on average, my 100K principal becomes \~300K by maturity date.
* Why not VOO/VTI and forget about it? Diversification (I plan on putting the other half on stocks). Also, will the mantra ""stock market produce 8% yield on average"" stay true in the future? I don't know, but I am sure the US Gov't will be there
* Inflation! Sure, there'll be inflationary periods, but that should be a fraction on the 30 yr timeline, no?

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping for some insight to the potential risk with the one contract he currently holds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 contract, 100 shares of apple - he does not own any shares of apple. &lt;/p&gt;

Currently 20 year old E-3 in the military making $1780 a month. Only monthly expenses are phone bill and food. Right now I am able to invest a little over $1000 of my pay a month. I maxed out my Roth IRA last year and plan to do so every year for the foreseeable future. The rest of the money goes into individual stocks and some crypto. I also contribute 5% of my pay to my  Roth TSP with a 5% match which is about $130 a month. I’ve been considering bumping this up to around 20%-25% ($600) instead of continuing to put it into individuals stocks/cryptos. That way when I get out, I can roll my Roth TSP into my Roth IRA essentially adding way more than the contribution limit for that year.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently 20 year old E-3 in the military making $1780 a month.

Could someone explain me why is Exxon mobil in the 10th place of the Dow Jones Global index with:

market cap of ~450b

 ~50% of free float

While Eli lilly and company:

market cap of ~500b

~100% of free float

Is outside the top 10? (Factsheet: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/dow-jones-global-index/#overview)

I know the rebalancing of this index is once per year in september and that LLY climb way faster than Exxon this year, however since it is float market cap weighted it should still be before Exxon no?

It also seems like the other global index puts LLY before Exxon so I guess there is an issue.

384,investing,"A buddy of mine just asked me to log into Mint and see how much I have been spending for the year.  The number was pretty shocking especially since it doesn't feel like I live all that extravagantly.   I've always planned to retire at age 45 or 50 or whatever (but I'll truthfully, I'll probably never retire, just start a new business and keep the mind strong) and my goal has always been $~~4~~ 5m in the stock portfolio so I can live on 4% of it which is $200,000 per year.  That seems reasonable, comfortable, and feasible especially if houses are paid off and college tuition is already put aside.

&amp;#x200B;

Well my buddy said, ""no, no, in 10 years your $200,000 spend per year is going to actually become $400,000 because the dollar will be worth way less! You actually need $10m to retire and keep your standard of living the same.""

My thought was, well I'm not saving cash that is weakening and losing to inflation, I'm owning stocks (mostly high growth stocks that trends along the DASDAQ).  Therefore every 10 years my portfolio will double historically if not more (we are currently at 283% on the 10 year coming off a massive low from Nov 2021 factored in).  So yes, my purchasing power might drop in 10 years and I need $400,000 to live the same way as $200,000 buys today but my portfolio will grow to match that if not exceed it especially if I'm only removing 4% each year and not the 6-10% it might grow on average.

What is the consensus here and who is thinking about this the right way?  Obviously being conservative and working harder to get that $10m nest egg is always the smartest option but is my train of thought flawed and I just don't understand something?

395,investing,"Hello all,

(TL;DR - income down and uncertain in the short term, big home improvement project coming up, way more money in stocks than savings. Need to tap into equities but unsure which ones would be best. Also seeking restructure/optimization advice on portfolio.)

Recent dip in income, trying to change careers, housing projects coming due - running into a situation where I think it would be more beneficial to liquidate shares and park in a high yield savings acct for less volatility with all the uncertainty in my short term future. Would love advice on which stocks/ETFs y'all think I should sell off or just general advice on my situation. 

Assets: currently ~$7k in checking/savings with upcoming deposit of $14k landing in the next few weeks. Bank offers 2% APY and I know I can get better returns elsewhere, just haven't really bothered as I keep most of my ""long-term"" money in stocks.

Income: TBD. Mortgage loan officer and times are tough. Followed a college to a new job with promises of greener grass but it isn't looking good. Pursuing career change for more stability. May take a few months+ for earnings to align with my target again. Wife works salary job @ $90k/yr.

Expenses: $2k/mo for my half of mtg + utilities + personal loan, $150 car payment. Round everything up and I'm probably $3k - $3,500/mo depending on how much fun I want to have on him weekends. 

Sitting on a $20k loan for the home project that I'm splitting payments on with the wife. Estimating another ~$10k+ on top for total project completion that will most likely come out of my pocket. Rate is 13.49%. Once the dust settles on the project plan is to pay it off aggressively depending on income. Got the loan as wife doesn't have full cash on hand and I'd rather have a slow trickle from my account rater than large lump sum payout. 

Got Robinhood in 2020 and quickly realized I have no idea what I'm really doing. Most of my money  is in ETFs but I think there's a fair amount of redundancy in my holdings and I'd probably benefit from consolidating. Some accounts are positive, some negative. Had to pay taxes last year but don't really anticipate that being the case for 2023.

I'm 28 so retirement is a far off horizon. Already maxing IRA and 401k so I consider my stocks to be more of a ""reserve"" account, ideally for long term growth but also access to additional funds if needed. Biggest fear I guess would be income stays low for a while while I figure things out, market tanks, now I'm selling stocks for pennies on the dollar to get by.

My thoughts/plan:

Sell off DAL, C, NDAQ, TAN, ICLN, &amp; SCHD for a total of $9,153 and net loss of $289. This should cover most of the additional housing expenses and minimize losses.

But what would you do from there, especially if I'm anticipating a big reduction in income for the next 6 months?  Been considering selling everything besides (V)ETFs and then shaving off additional equity as needed but idk if that would be most prudent. 

Thanks in advance. Didn't mean for this to turn into a text wall.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(TL;DR - income down and uncertain in the short term, big home improvement project coming up, way more money in stocks than savings. Need to tap into equities but unsure which ones would be best. Also seeking restructure/optimization advice on portfolio.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent dip in income, trying to change careers, housing projects coming due - running into a situation where I think it would be more beneficial to liquidate shares and park in a high yield savings acct for less volatility with all the uncertainty in my short term future. Would love advice on which stocks/ETFs y&amp;#39;all think I should sell off or just general advice on my situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assets: currently ~$7k in checking/savings with upcoming deposit of $14k landing in the next few weeks. Bank offers 2% APY and I know I can get better returns elsewhere, just haven&amp;#39;t really bothered as I keep most of my &amp;quot;long-term&amp;quot; money in stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Income: TBD. Mortgage loan officer and times are tough. Followed a college to a new job with promises of greener grass but it isn&amp;#39;t looking good. Pursuing career change for more stability. May take a few months+ for earnings to align with my target again. Wife works salary job @ $90k/yr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expenses: $2k/mo for my half of mtg + utilities + personal loan, $150 car payment. Round everything up and I&amp;#39;m probably $3k - $3,500/mo depending on how much fun I want to have on him weekends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting on a $20k loan for the home project that I&amp;#39;m splitting payments on with the wife. Estimating another ~$10k+ on top for total project completion that will most likely come out of my pocket. Rate is 13.49%. Once the dust settles on the project plan is to pay it off aggressively depending on income. Got the loan as wife doesn&amp;#39;t have full cash on hand and I&amp;#39;d rather have a slow trickle from my account rater than large lump sum payout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got Robinhood in 2020 and quickly realized I have no idea what I&amp;#39;m really doing. Most of my money  is in ETFs but I think there&amp;#39;s a fair amount of redundancy in my holdings and I&amp;#39;d probably benefit from consolidating. Some accounts are positive, some negative. Had to pay taxes last year but don&amp;#39;t really anticipate that being the case for 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

For those not in the know TSM fabs like 50% of apple chips, all NVDA chips. They are the most sophisticated chip fabrication plant on the globe. 

TSM is hanging right around the bottom of the channel of the uptrend. 

now this is a solid company, solid financials, 2% annual dividend, diversifying into arizona (with struggles) and germany (with both comes a lesser ability to produce chips than the main Taiwan factory), which removes **some** of the risk of being solely in Taiwan. Maybe a japan factory as well?

If you bought around 93-92 dollars, set a stop loss at say 87 or 86 being a significant break in trend, or maybe even as low as 84 or 83, a real break in the trend, you would lose somewhere between 6.5% to 10%. 

now if TSM continues the uptrend and we go to 100 you are up 7.5%

if we go to 105 youre up 12.9%

if TSM suprasses a high on its trip down in 2022 around 109 to hit 110, you're up 18.2%

and it just continues up from there, i mean you hit 115 and the risk reward is totally worth it. So you're a long term holder buying into the bottom of the uptrend and setting a stop loss around 88-87, 5-6% risk to make maybe 20% on the high upside, maybe 12.9-7.5 on the lowside. 

its a decent bet.

A bit of background: I'm 27 years old, living in one of the European countries, and I've been involved in stock market investments for more than 3 years now. I started with stock picking, and it just so happened that during the COVID crisis in 2020, I bought quite a few stocks (most of them are from S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats) and other wide ETFs during the downturn. I continued to delve into the topic of investments, studied literature and some stuff, and realized that the stock-picking is not that I want to solely follow. The strategy that suits me is just a long-term investment in the broad market (FTSE All-World / MSCI World) to secure a stable passive income by the age of 45-50 and have a comfortable retirement. I've come to the conclusion that in my case, Irish accumulating ETFs are the most advantageous way, allowing me to defer tax payment until withdrawing the money and not pay taxes upon dividend receipt.  


The question here is that intellectually, I understand that it's more profitable for me to invest in Irish ETFs that accumulate dividends and don't pay them directly into my account but reinvest them in buying more stocks. However, I enjoy the fact of receiving dividends in my account, right when they come in and I get notifications, seeing the statistics. It seems to give me a certain sense of confidence, and it's just nice to see those income streams.  


Since I was about 19, I've enjoyed playing incremental, accumulating games (like idle/clickers) where I can see the results of my actions and how some characteristic accumulates. I mean, I liked compound interest in games, particularly the behavior of ""invested - received more soon."" It seems to stem from my childhood, perhaps some personality trait or something that influenced me - I'm not sure.

444,investing,"Dear fellow investors, and fellow participants,

I'd like to share some insights into my investment journey. In January 2022, I embarked on my investment voyage, adopting a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) approach with monthly contributions into IWDA. In February, I deviated slightly from this pattern, making a lump sum investment equivalent to five months' worth of contributions, but then resumed the regular DCA strategy. Throughout this journey, I've maintained a long-term perspective and remained unfazed by temporary losses or seeing my portfolio in the red.

In 2023, I decided to diversify my holdings further by investing in four individual stocks, allocating funds equivalent to three months' worth of expenses to each. I successfully executed this strategy, and at present, I've deployed roughly one-third of my capital, while two-thirds remain in cash.

However, the cash portion of my portfolio is currently parked in a savings account. Regrettably, in the world of Europoor banking. While this cash provides a sense of security, it's not doing much in terms of growing my wealth.

**The rationale behind maintaining a significant cash position is tied to my mortgage, which is due for a rate adjustment in approximately three years and a few months. Currently, I enjoy a favorable interest rate of just 1.7%. While I'm prepared for the possibility of higher rates, I prefer to have a cushion of funds readily available to handle any potential increases. This financial safety net, which comprises the two-thirds of my cash holdings, serves as a precautionary measure to ensure I can comfortably address any future rate adjustments.**

**Of course, I'll continue to generate income, save, and invest during this period, further bolstering my financial position. Consequently, my query is twofold: Where should I consider placing this (for me substantial) cash reserve, and should I be open to slightly more aggressive investment options given my longer time horizon, recognizing that I won't require these funds in the immediate three-year window?**

Your insights and advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

Or, 
You sell on a balanced approach? Maybe some winners, keep some losers if they might bump up?
Or, 
re-evaluate every sale, see if the losers have potential to come back, sell some winners, or a bit from the ETF's?

&lt;p&gt;There are also two large positions in a Dividend ETF and Total US market ETF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking for strategies on whether it&amp;#39;s wise to sell the losers first?
Or, 
You sell on a balanced approach? Maybe some winners, keep some losers if they might bump up?
Or, 
re-evaluate every sale, see if the losers have potential to come back, sell some winners, or a bit from the ETF&amp;#39;s?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestions are all welcome.
No one really talks about selling stocks when you&amp;#39;re into retirement and you need it to pay the bills.&lt;/p&gt;

462,investing,"A  big challenge with long-term buy-and-hold in index funds is that many people have trouble sticking with the strategy through bad times - even though they know they should stick to it - and sell.  

Here is what I have found works for me as a psychological trick:  I track my portfolios in Mint, but do so manually (no auto-updates).  I track them as an ""asset"" or ""cash"" with a fixed number I manually input.  So the number only changes when I change the number.  And my rule is that those numbers only ever stay the same or go up (as a portfolio increases), never down (in bad times), because I am not going to realize losses and will eventually recover over the decades.  The losses aren't real because they aren't realized.  I have found this makes it much easier to ignore losses - because Mint tells me that if I don't sell, I'll return to a given number XXXXX if I just stick it out and wait to bounce back.

Example:  Portfolio of index funds starts valued at $100,000.  Market downturn takes its value down to $75,000, but I keep it set at $100,000 in Mint.  Market eventually recovers to $105,000, and I add that value into Mint at that time.

Note that this approach DOES still punish you a bit during a downturn:  Let's suppose that during the downturn to $75,000, I deposit $5,000 a month from my checking account into my index fund portfolio.  That money effectively ""disappears"" from Mint, because it decreases the value of my checking account and does not increase the value of my portfolio in Mint.  (It just increases the holdings in my real portfolio, which remain below the $100,000 value in Mint.)   

In some ways, this is like a poor-man's version of a hedge fund:  It doesn't actually hedge market risk (a real hedge [usually](https://youtube.com/watch?v=DZ2QZg_1pHQ&amp;t=387s&amp;ab_channel=HowMoneyWorks) costs you returns), but it psychologically makes you feel like you are hedged against market risk and makes it less psychologically painful to buy-and-hold through a downturn, because the set $100,000 is basically a representation of your anticipated recovery if you hold.

 Another benefit is that it makes you feel like you are making ""progress"" toward your financial goals:  Even if my portfolio is down over an entire year, if I am gaining a bit in cash, or real estate, or whatever else in Mint, it reflects my net worth increasing over time, which provides another big psychological boost.

In short, this is just a psychological strategy, not an investment strategy.  But if it makes it psychologically easier for some people to actually execute on their intended investment strategy of long-term buy-and-hold in index funds, it could provide better returns.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A  big challenge with long-term buy-and-hold in index funds is that many people have trouble sticking with the strategy through bad times - even though they know they should stick to it - and sell.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this approach DOES still punish you a bit during a downturn:  Let&amp;#39;s suppose that during the downturn to $75,000, I deposit $5,000 a month from my checking account into my index fund portfolio.  That money effectively &amp;quot;disappears&amp;quot; from Mint, because it decreases the value of my checking account and does not increase the value of my portfolio in Mint.  (It just increases the holdings in my real portfolio, which remain below the $100,000 value in Mint.)   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this is like a poor-man&amp;#39;s version of a hedge fund:  It doesn&amp;#39;t actually hedge market risk (a real hedge &lt;a href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=DZ2QZg_1pHQ&amp;amp;t=387s&amp;amp;ab_channel=HowMoneyWorks""&gt;usually&lt;/a&gt; costs you returns), but it psychologically makes you feel like you are hedged against market risk and makes it less psychologically painful to buy-and-hold through a downturn, because the set $100,000 is basically a representation of your anticipated recovery if you hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is that it makes you feel like you are making &amp;quot;progress&amp;quot; toward your financial goals:  Even if my portfolio is down over an entire year, if I am gaining a bit in cash, or real estate, or whatever else in Mint, it reflects my net worth increasing over time, which provides another big psychological boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, this is just a psychological strategy, not an investment strategy.  But if it makes it psychologically easier for some people to actually execute on their intended investment strategy of long-term buy-and-hold in index funds, it could provide better returns.&lt;/p&gt;

Both have about the same amount of funds but I am trying to simplify. I've looked into transferring funds from acorns to fidelity so I have more direct control, but the fees associated with it are pretty high.

&lt;p&gt;Both have about the same amount of funds but I am trying to simplify. I&amp;#39;ve looked into transferring funds from acorns to fidelity so I have more direct control, but the fees associated with it are pretty high.

1) One if on Fidelity from a previous employer. This account has about 3k in a target date for for 2065 (LIWKX) that has 60% allocated to domestic stock and 36% allocated to foreign stock.

Going to the ""Activity and Orders"" tab I see three categories occuring over and over again ""ADVISOR / CONSULTANT FEE"", ""Realized Gain/Loss"", and ""RECORDKEEPING FEE"". Is there anything I could do to minimize the fees?

In recent years, DIP loans have become increasingly complex. They are often tied to other transactions, such as rights offerings and backstop fees. This can give the DIP lender significant control over the reorganization plan process.

The research paper ""Standardizing and Unbundling the Sub Rosa DIP Loan"" by Kenneth Ayotte of UC Berkeley School of Law examines the problem of sub rosa DIP loans. A sub rosa DIP loan is a DIP loan that is used to effectively predetermine the terms of the reorganization plan.

The paper argues that sub rosa DIP loans can harm the interests of other creditors. It proposes two solutions to the problem:

1. Standardizing the terms of DIP loans. This would make it more difficult for DIP lenders to use their control over the loan to extract favorable terms in the reorganization plan.

2. Unbundling the terms of DIP loans. This would separate the loan from other transactions, such as rights offerings and backstop fees. This would make it easier for other creditors to assess the value of the loan and to negotiate with the DIP lender.

Constellation Software, Inc. &gt; &gt; CONSTELLATION SOFTWARE INC. DECLARES DIVIDEND AND FILES FINAL PROSPECTUS IN RELATION TO PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED RIGHTS OFFERING OF SERIES 1 DEBENTURES  
Toronto, Ontario – August 23, 2023 – Constellation Software Inc. (TSX: CSU) (the “Company”)  
announced today that it has declared a special dividend (the “Rights Dividend”) pursuant to which  
all common shareholders (the “Shareholders”) of record as of the close of business on September 1,  
2023 (the “Record Date”) will be entitled to receive, by way of a dividend-in-kind, one right of the  
Company (each, a “Right”) for each common share of the Company (the “Common Shares”) held.  
This dividend has been designated as an eligible dividend for purposes of the Income Tax Act  
(Canada) and any similar provincial and territorial legislation.  
The Company also announced that it hasfiled a final short form prospectus (the “Final Prospectus”)  
in relation to its previously announced rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) pursuant to which the  
Company will issue the Rights in satisfaction of the Rights Dividend that will entitle the  
Shareholders to purchase up to C$700 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured subordinated  
floating rate debentures, Series 1 of the Company (the “Series 1 Debentures”).  
The Series 1 Debentures will be issued as an additional tranche of, and will form a single series with,  
the outstanding C$282.2 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured subordinated floating rate  
debentures, Series 1 of the Company. There is no minimum principal amount of Debentures that  
must be issuable upon the exercise of Rights.  
The net proceeds of the Rights Offering are expected to be used by the Company to pay down  
indebtedness under its existing credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), with any remaining proceeds  
to be used for future acquisitions.  
The Rights will be issued in satisfaction of the Rights Dividend in the amount of one Right per  
Common Share. For every 3.03 Rights held, the holder of such Rights will be entitled to subscribe  
for C$100 principal amount of Series 1 Debentures. The Rights and the Series 1 Debentures will be  
qualified for distribution in each province and territory of Canada by way of the Final Prospectus  
and the Debentures have been registered in the United States on Form F-7 under the United States  
Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  
The Series 1 Debentures are expected to be issued on October 6, 2023 (the “Issue Date”) and will  
have the same terms and conditions as the currently outstanding unsecured subordinated floating rate  
debentures, Series 1 of the Company.  
The Series 1 Debentures have a maturity date of March 31, 2040 (the “Maturity Date”). The Series  
1 Debentures will be issuable only in denominations of C$100 and integral multiples thereof and,  
from and including the Issue Date to but excluding March 31, 2024, will bear interest at a rate of  
13.3% per annum (the “Current Rate”). From and including March 31, 2024 to but excluding the  
Maturity Date, the interest rate applicable to the Series 1 Debentures will be reset on an annual basis  
on March 31 of each year, at a rate equal to the annual average percentage change in the All-items  
Consumer Price Index during the 12 month period ending on December 31 in the prior year (which  
amount may be positive or negative) plus 6.5% (the “Floating Interest Rate”). Notwithstanding the  
foregoing, the interest rate applicable to the Series 1 Debentures will not be less than 0%. Interest, if  
any, will be payable quarterly in arrears in equal instalments on March 31, June 30, September 30  
and December 31 in each year. The Current Rate will only apply to the Series 1 Debentures in  
respect of the interest payments up to and including March 31, 2024. Effective March 31, 2024, the  
interest rate payable on the Series 1 Debentures will be based on the applicable Floating Interest  
Rate.  
All payments in respect of the Series 1 Debentures will be subordinated in right of payment to the  
prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the Company, which includes the Credit Facility.  
The Rights will be exercisable until 4:30 p.m. (Toronto time) (the “Expiry Time”) on September 29,  
2023 (the “Expiry Date”) at a price of C$133 per C$100 principal amount of Series 1 Debentures  
purchased, plus accrued interest in the amount of C$0.217 per C$100 principal amount of Series 1  
Debentures purchased on account of interest accrued on the Series 1 Debentures from, and including,  
September 30, 2023 to, but excluding the Issue Date. Rights not fully exercised prior to the Expiry  
Time on the Expiry Date will be void and of no further value.  
The Rights will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) under the symbol “CSU.RT”  
and will be posted for trading on the TSX until 12:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the Expiry Date, at  
which time they will be halted from trading. The TSX has approved the listing of the Rights and the  
Series 1 Debentures, subject to the Company fulfilling all of the requirements of the TSX.  
A copy of the Final Prospectus and, in the case of eligible Shareholders, statements issued under the  
Computershare Direct Registration System, accompanied by rights subscription forms representing  
the Rights to which they are entitled, will be mailed to registered Shareholders following the Record  
Date. Registered Shareholders wishing to exercise their Rights must forward the completed rights  
subscription forms along with the applicable subscription proceeds to Computershare Trust  
Company of Canada by no later than the Expiry Time. Shareholders who hold their Common Shares  
through an intermediary will receive materials and instructions from their intermediary.

I realise it’s a lot of western world, first-world countries, especially USA. But in my mind I should stick to politically and militarily stable nations with low levels of corruption and bureaucracy. This basically excludes all of Africa, Middle east (except Israel) and most of Asia. 

What I know of my own home EU, is that it’s a heavily taxed and bureaucratic mess and it’s share of total world-wealth has been shrinking while USA’s has stayed the same. On top of that it’s old money, old companies, old nations with workers who rather strikes than innovates. It’s hard doing business and starting new companies, e.g in Sweden it’s almost impossible firing people even if they are jot qualified for what you now need them to do.

565,investing,"Hi all,

I understand how the ‘power law’ reduces idiosyncratic risk, but some prestigious, titans of VC/SV have been very keen to raise industry-specific funds over the past few years in the hopes of catching fledgling industries, which obviously concentrates sector-specific risk.

I think often about a16z and how they have 4 separate funds that are each dedicated to crypto. The size of these funds are quite significant, with the latest crypto-only fund (raised in 2022) having an initial raise/starting capital of $4.5B. In aggregate, around 22% of a16z’s AUM is currently in crypto-only funds. I can’t help but feel that when the entire crypto-ponzi collapses, this could mark the death of a16z after LPs in these funds make near 100% losses on the crypto-focussed funds. I assume other notable VC houses like Sequoia will take a big hit, although a16z is by far the largest VC to have shovelled a substantial amount of its AUM into a giant ponzi, as far as I can make out.

I note that a16z’s ‘best bets’, namely Coinbase and AirBnB, have both slumped post-IPO, with returns of -79% and -30% over their public equity lives (so far), and so a16z may have a much harder time pulling off eye-watering valuations for their next round of IPOs, crypto or otherwise.

&lt;p&gt;I note that a16z’s ‘best bets’, namely Coinbase and AirBnB, have both slumped post-IPO, with returns of -79% and -30% over their public equity lives (so far), and so a16z may have a much harder time pulling off eye-watering valuations for their next round of IPOs, crypto or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess years of low interest rates can make anyone look like an investing genius, and in higher rate environments, the fads don’t last.&lt;/p&gt;

It looks like there isn't a clear winner in terms of historical performance.  However, these research papers say that non-FMC weighted funds are superior.  (FMC = floating market cap)

In my case, i'd feel better having some bond income I can rely on.

So lets say my target stock/bond allocation is 67/33, and I have 3MM equally distributed across 2 401K's and 1 taxable account.  Which is the better allocation...

OPTION 1:  401K (A) = 100% equities |  401K (B) = 100% equities | TAXABLE = 100% fixed income

OPTION 2:  401K (A) = 67/33  |  401K (B) = 67/33 | TAXABLE = 67/33

I like option 2 because it's much easier to rebalance (as each account is compartmentalized).  I don't like option 2 because bond yield is less, and it's less tax efficient.

One method uses VT and the international exposure will fluctuate with the market. The other uses VTI and VXUS to control the international exposure at a fixed 20% (Jack Bogle's advice to never go over 20% into international).

I also added 50% to of the equity portion VOO because it seems that both Jack Boggle and Warren Buffet like the S&amp;P 500. This will make it heavyweight in the S&amp;P 500.

Overall, I can't decide who's right. Some people like just one of the core Equity ETFs I used (VT, VTI or VOO) and I tried to split the difference.

We then want to get a 2nd investment property as soon as possible via job savings, equity and airbnb income.

All while renting cheap as its flexible and offers flexibility with my job moving me around which can happen.

Disclaimer: I am an european based investor so I am using ETFs available in EU and fiscally optimized, so you could see unfamiliar tickers but please take in consideration the tracked indexes.

Parameters

1. After some research on Fama/French Factors I want to introduce the factor of Value and Quality into the Developed market stock ETFs tracking **MSCI World Sector Neutral Quality Index** and **MSCI World Enhanced Value Index** (if you know better index to use please let me know, these are the ones I found that I can invest -VTV for example is unavailable in EU- but would like to see alternatives). Equal weight between the 2
2. Introduce a size factor with Small Caps but with focus on Value since this is the portion of the SC that gives better returns. The only option here for me is mixing **MSCI US Small Cap Value** and **MSCI EU Small Cap Value**, unluckily I don't have options for World Small Cap Value in EU. Here I would overweight US Small Cap to sort of recreate a total market cap weight.
3. After long thoughts I decided to exclude Emerging Markets from the portfolio, since I am reading a lot on it and I am starting to get convinced that the risk/return is not so appealing due to more uncertainty of the political and financial landscape of these countries.

I have done different backtests and the results are interesting. First of all I noticed that there was a quite strong volatility and playing around with different hedges I have seen that a 10% Gold reduces yearly return of less than 0.1% on 25 years period but mitigates significantly the volatility. I am not a fan of Gold but I added into the test portfolio that is now as following

&amp;#x200B;

* **35% MSCI World Sector Neutral Quality Index ETF (XDEV)**
* **35% MSCI World Enhanced Value Index ETF (XDEQ)**
* **12.5% MSCI US Small Cap Value ETF (ZPRV)**
* **7,5% MSCI EU Small Cap Value ETF (ZPRX)**
* **10% Gold ETF (SGLD)**

I have then backtested it against SP500 (last 25 years)

and world total stock (VWCE last 20 years)

[https://imgur.com/bPjYAi7](https://imgur.com/bPjYAi7)

I tried do backtest for a longer period but cant find a tool to do it. If anyone has a way to do that would be fantastic.

As you see the portfolio performed significantly better in terms of total returns. On yearly returns it was almost 1% better than SP500 and 1,5% of Total World.

I&amp;#39;m a young working profession, but probably won&amp;#39;t be purchasing another property for about 4 more years and will continue renting in the meanwhile. I&amp;#39;m looking for a mildly aggressive but stable investment strategy going forward to build up some capital before I look to buy another property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I&amp;#39;m thinking to put 1/3 into CDs (12-18 month), 1/3 in assorted large cap stocks, and finally 1/3 into 3-fund mutual fund portfolio - large cap, entire stock market, and a third more aggressive mutual fund (like the fidelity disruptors, or small/mid cap mutual fund). What do you guys think? Am I missing anything? Definitely appreciate any suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;

Market cap = shares outstanding \* stock price

Say, for example, AMC does a 10:1 reverse stock split so shares outstanding goes from 58,000,000 to 550,000,000.

The stock price obviously increases as well. Well if stock price and shares outstanding increases why wouldn't this increase market cap?

Chatgpt says this is understandably wrong and Reverse splits involve shares outstanding decreasing. Well, this is confusing to me too. If shares outstanding decreases then why did AMC's increase?

&lt;p&gt;It just seems like these pre-ipo sales are just a grift like alpha video games on steam. I&amp;#39;m not talking about what happens to the stock after it goes public, but how late stage investors are able to purchase shares at sometimes a 75% discount over early retail investors.&lt;/p&gt;

""Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday called for more vigilance in the fight against inflation, warning that additional interest rate increases could be yet to come.

While acknowledging that progress has been made, the central bank leader said inflation is still above where policymakers feel comfortable. ""

Having listened to Powell's speech, he mainly pointed out that core PCE inflation is still too high at 4.1%. While headline inflation is lower right now at 3%, as soon as energy (or food) prices would go higher again, something you can expect going into winter, also headline inflation will go higher again if core inflation doesn't push back against it.

**So expect more hikes. Energy prices will move higher towards winter and if core doesn't come down drastically, overall inflation will stay high or move even higher. That's what Powell was basically referring to. His preferred indicator is core PCE minus housing.**

How does one calculate a total projected portfolio growth when dollar cost averaging? I don't even know if that's phrased well enough, so I'll try to explain what I mean.  
  
The SP500 has a growth of \~51% over the last 5 years, which is an average return of \~8.59% annually.  
  
If one is to dollar cost average, say yearly of the same amount and a ""fixed"" 8.59% annual return for simplicity, the growths at the end of the 5th year: the initial investment made at the start of year 1 is +51%, the 2nd year investment is +39%, the 3rd year investment is +28%, the 4th year investment is 17.9%, the 5th year investment is +8.6%.  
  
The total portfolio growth at the end of the 5th year is therefore \~+28.9%.  
  
If one makes a 6th year contribution, which has 0% growth, the portfolio growth drops to 24%. But by the end of the 6th year it's up to 33%.  
  
Is there a way to calculate that growth number with inputs for years of investing, DCA amount, DCA frequency, average annual rate of return?  
  
I guess even more importantly, is this metric even important? I don't really see ""total growth"" represented and the focus is always that annualized average growth. I'm just curious after say 30 or 40 years of investing, what's the total gain on the portfolio? One would constantly be averaging in that 0% at their latest DCA contribution, but the older investments would (hopefully) have a very high return while newer investments are still low just based on time spent in the market.  
  
Obviously it's understood some percentages are higher, some are lower or even negative, and the annualized average is historically near that 8% (call it 6-10%ish).

My question is, should I sit on this and continue to invest? Or would it be better to take out the profits and reinvest, either back into Nvidia if their sticks dip or in so thing else. 

I have not invested in them recently as their stock is high and it seems I would make much on the investment, is this also the correct thing to do?

640,investing,"Hi all, I've been brushing up with this forum and some of the recommended books and finally decided to jump ship from Northwestern Mutual and do my own thing in Schwab. Problem is, the holdings they were using are ""institution customers only"" funds that are kind of built for wealth managers to tool around with (and get paid a lil extra too). So that means they have huge expense ratios and I think some other stuff I don't understand... Stuff that makes them not really the best option for a personal investor to have.

They are Russell Tax Managed funds with expense ratios around 0.9-1.0%. It's a basic mix of bonds and stocks, only about 7 holdings total. Unfortunately one of them was *never* sold since 2017, so it has a huge capital gain. I don't know how to get rid of it at this point without incurring a ton of taxes.

I think I can manage some of the other holdings, a couple of them are a net loss, even after 8 years somehow... so I think I could offset that by selling one with an equal net gain.

But yeah, it's a process I think, and I'm on the fence about doing it at all. I don't know if it's worth it to mess around with it at this point, aside from just rebalancing every so often.

They seemingly own Infrastructure for the next generation of computing, AI, and they are delivering on the promise.  70%GMs, a clear runway littered with fat margin dollars waiting to be scooped up, and no one giving any kind of meaningful challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with growth like that is Nvidia overvalued?&lt;/p&gt;

Allocate a portion to a high-yield savings and draw from that for personal funds, allocate a portion into an ETF to keep long-term, and lastly maintain a portion of the tech company stocks and leverage covered calls to generate some cash from these shares while also still getting dividends (this portion would probably get pulled for my own startup if needed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious to know what you all think about this strategy and if you recommend any other ways of going about this which could yield better returns.&lt;/p&gt;

My particular situation makes this confusing and I’m looking for any suggestions. Over 45yo / Married w 2 children/  Combined yrly income of about 350k and I live in a very HCOL city,  so with childcare and shelter, we’re pretty comfortable and have some extra $ each month. 

Firstly, I’m vested into a pension plan with my union that says I can expect to be getting about 2k per month when I retire. Not enough to live on in 20 years where I live. 

Secondly, I had a small non-active rollover IRA that I just reactivated, maxed out and invested in broad market funds through fidelity.

I’ve also just set up two 529s for my kids that I put money in each month. 

So, here I am with only a small pension and an underfunded (newly) maxed out RolloverIRA. So now I’m looking for additional options to supplement my retirement to make up for the lost time. I talked with a fidelity advisor and he pointed out that I really don’t have many options. Because I’m considered a “high income earner” (even though living in this city + childcare bleeds me dry) ..with an over 250k income, I am not allowed to even set up a personal 401k, Roth, SEP IRA, or any other tax advantaged vehicle.

So what then are my options? How does one strategize a retirement when all the tax advantaged vehicles are for &gt;200k income earners?  Am I stuck with just a small pension, social security,  and whatever this Rollover IRA makes over the next 20 years? Is the stock market ETF my only safe-ish option to put money into and hope I make up lost investment time? 

TLDR: Small pension + recently started Rollover IRA. What other catch-up retirement investment options are there for some one who makes over the 250k per year limit to make up for not getting started earlier?

Because I’m considered a “high income earner” (even though living in this city + childcare bleeds me dry) ..with an over 250k income, I am not allowed to even set up a personal 401k, Roth, SEP IRA, or any other tax advantaged vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what then are my options? How does one strategize a retirement when all the tax advantaged vehicles are for &amp;gt;200k income earners?  Am I stuck with just a small pension, social security,  and whatever this Rollover IRA makes over the next 20 years? Is the stock market ETF my only safe-ish option to put money into and hope I make up lost investment time? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Small pension + recently started Rollover IRA. What other catch-up retirement investment options are there for some one who makes over the 250k per year limit to make up for not getting started earlier? &lt;/p&gt;

You probably won't, because you're competing with bunches of other people who are smarter than you. Generally people are just taking more risk than they realize.

What about the opposite? Excluding stocks or sectors you consider junk whilst holding the market portfolio otherwise. For instance, if you held every bank stock but Credit Suisse over the past few years, you would have outperformed the sector. If you held every sector but crypto, you would have outperformed the market.

I heard of one study where it was found that small cap value stocks were found to underperform the market. This made no sense to the researchers as these stocks should outperform on average since they are riskier than the market. The study corrected this discrepancy by excluding stocks that met criteria for terminal decline.

The question is can one reasonably expect to identify stocks before or during terminal decline? For instance, with all the regulatory hoopla over digital money, it is likely wise to not own coinbase or the miners because even if they don't go to zero a lot of them will inevitably terminate in liquidation. This is not advising to short, because shorting costs money, but you may capture the upside benefit of their underperformance even if they do not go to zero. Likewise, Nikola stock experienced years of slow underperformance following the criminal charges against Trevor Milton, but his employees have used the scraps from that fraud to make a real truck factory.

I started investing more than a year ago. Since then, I have been reading various books and following (IMO) credible people to learn how to evaluate companies for long time investing.  
  
I still have plenty of candidates to screen that I am interested in. However, I get stuck on some now since those are companies that are young (concerning being public). So, I find it hard to make a rational decision if it is worth a buy or not.  
  
Let me explain: I am a molecular biologist and had a job interview with a company that is dealing with synthetic biology (They did not take me but I found a job somewhere else). That topic was highly interesting. I read a bit into it and realized that there is huge growth potential in this industry for the coming years. Now, since I started screening biotech companies for the beginning (since this is something I know stuff about) I sometimes encounter the issue of not being able to evaluate a company based on them being too short on the market (aside from ALL other biotech companies that are overvalued or just hard to evaluate since the Pandemic just boosted all their share prices and revenue into oblivion for 2 year).  
  
Anyway, so I am specifically talking about Twist Bioscience, Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings and Azenta (maybe also Termo Scientific, but they are way too overvalued right now). So, for those companies, I cannot apply any of the standard valuations like calculation its ""fair"" value applying growth estimates through EPS and P/E. Also, discounted cash flow model is a problem since these companies are starting out and their numbers are red. Graham’s formula or the multiple valuation model is also useless since EPS and P/E are basically non-existent.  
  
I am fan of TWST. Have been a customer in the past and now again at my new position. Also, their plans, projects, and visions of TWST and DNA sound very intriguing and the CEOs seem rational, potent, and capable.  
  
I hope you see the dilemma I am in. There are potential candidates that I think have a big growth potential with a big intrinsic value (scientifically and culturally). However, I cannot predict the fair share price value due to limiting available data.  
  
What do you do in this situation? The only thing that seems to look ""good"" are revenue data and equity growth for these companies. Is it valid to just look at these datapoints? Because ROIC, EPS, cash or P/E are non-existing or in minus. Even though for example TWIST is a well-known and reliable company that obviously has a growing revenue steam.  
  
I am happy for any tips and discussions concerning this topic. I do not want your opinion if those companies are a buy or not. I want input concerning the process of making rational discissions based on the limited data available in this case and how to guestimate (?) the potential future of such innovative but young companies.

706,investing,"Hi, i have some spare money that i want to spend. I have read that a lump sum investment is most of the times better. First i thought to invest it all at once in a S&amp;P ETF. Then i researched that the S&amp;P is a composite index of the 11 sectors in which IT sector is 27% and healthcare is 15% and financial is 10% and energy only 2,5%

So i thought i could shape them on my own predictions.

So my preliminary plan is following:

1000 $ iShares S&amp;P 500 Information technology sector (slight recession fears for Q1/24, still good idea? could also invest more since i expect most growth in IT sector in all the market)

1000$ iShares World Healthcare sector (etf has lost a few %, maybe the dip is there and  new vaccines about to be distributed this fall/winter and also because of demographics i expect growth in this sector)

1000$ iShares S&amp;P 500 Consumer staples (defensive even in recession)

1000$ iShares World Energy sector (i believe that energy prices will still rise and the energy corps. won't invest so much for growth and instead they will rise prises to profit because of climate change )

Because of the recent defaults in the banking sector like SVB i predict no growth rather a downturn in financial sector (10% of the S&amp;P index, might dampen the index). For consumer discretionary i am not sure. It all depends if there will be a slight recession as the current news is indicating or that is already priced in as it alwalys is in the stock market. Also if the interest rate hikes end, more growth for IT sector and probably consumer discretionary could be anticipated. For communications services sector i am not sure.

Feel free to comment on my predictions or on my strategy. Maybe i am delusional and a fool. I simply don't want to wait if the S&amp;P remains sideways for years when in fact some sectors grow and some are in downturn. Because of the broad diversification i fear that i loose potentional gains.

So over the 2008-2020 window as bond rates fell, bond funds have collected low return rate bonds (hopefully mid to short term, but likely some long term).

I've been trying to read up more on the various KPIs and ratios one can use to gauge the ""quality"" of a portfolio.

719,investing,"Bonds are historically mediocre at returning positive real yields, which is why I've avoided them.  But it seems to me that using bonds to bet on an interest rate reversion seems promising.

Here are the premises, as I see them:

* 30 year T-bonds are paying [4.45%](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us)

* The Fed is seeking to return to 2% inflation.  During the 2010-2019 pre-covid era, at this inflation level, [30 year bond yields were about 1.5-2%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS30)

* There are good reasons to believe that the current episode of inflation is an economic readjustment from covid era shifts in demand, not a consequence of pre-covid low rates.

* If I use the zero-coupon bond equation value for interest rate r, par value V, years Y: Price=*P=V/(1+r)^Y* I get the following 30 year 3-year-holding period  nominal-dollar profits for holding bonds through an interest rate shift from rate r1 to r2, as *Profit = [(1+r2)^(Y-3)/(1+r1)^(Y)]-1*

    * +116% profit if 30 year bond rates drop to 'normal' level of 2% after 3 years

    * +66% profit if 30 year bond rates drop to 3% after 3 years

    * 1.2% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 5% after 3 years

    * 23.5% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 6% after 3 years

    * 40% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 7% after 3 years

If one is afraid of inflation during the holding period, one could pay a similar game with TIPS, which yield over 2%, but for recent history have tended to [cluster around 1%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII30).   In this case, buying TIPS at 2% and selling in 3 years at a 1% rate would yield a 38% real-dollar profit, or about 11% a year.

Personally, I think that it is far more likely for rates to hold steady or fall back to 2%, because the 2009 to 2020 2% inflation era seemed to work OK economically.

So under this reasoning, the sensible strategy might be to bail  out of stocks, pile into long-term T-bonds, and get back into stocks if and when stock prices (P/E) readjust to more closely reflect the traditional 4% equity risk premium, roughly   P/E=1/(2% real  bond yield + 4% equity risk premium )=17.  Or even if P/E doesn't fall, holding bonds through an interest rate decline would give one a lot more money to put into modestly historically overpriced stocks.

One of my reasons is that I already invest a hefty amount into funds which have majority Apple and Microsoft. I don't want my entire life's and retirement savings to be 30% dependent on 2 stocks no matter what they are.

I have found many ETFs which buy S&amp;P500 stocks based on various performance indicators. Some are quite speculative which doesn't interest me. But others are based on things such as quality factor, cash flow, volatility, etc.

A couple of examples are MOAT which is based on companies which have a wide moat, or competitive advantage, which would be difficult for competitors to overcome. Another is SPHQ which is based on quality factor.

Both of these ETFs have a 10 year return of higher than the S&amp;P500 despite both being based on S&amp;P stocks. They're just weighted and selected differently. Clearly this has been working and those strategies logically seem like they'd be successful

My question is why are these ETFs and others like them not as popular as the most common bulk, market cap weighted S&amp;P ETFs? Their long term annualized returns obviously made the extra expense ratio worth it for the past decade. Their portfolios logically make sense to me. They do still own a lot of the same stocks just at lower percentages of the overall holdings

I’m then going to invest 30 percent of whatever I get into ETF’s or an index fund and the other 70 percent into dividend growth stocks.

It has the option of stock and/or bonds. Account limit is 100K total with 15K a year. I've been looking into it but I'm unsure about how it fully operates within those limits when it comes to the investing. Like what happens if a stock suddenly goes up and it pushes my account over the 15K a year limit. Or is it only if I pull the money from the stock it'll count? 

Bonds are obviously the safer option but I'm not even sure how to start reading the information.

I tried going to a Fifth and Third bank, which the ABLE account operates through, but their financial advisor said he had never heard of that account and wouldn't be able to give me information specifically for it. 

I've also tried calling their number but the hold was over 2 hours by the time I hung up. I understand long wait times are typical for government lines but I even called as soon as they opened at 8am on a Wednesday.

I assume this CD is callable at any time over the 2 year maturity period.

What I thought YTW meant was the minimum yield I would receive if the CD called before maturity. I would have expected that to be less then the coupon rate itself, so I must be misunderstanding what all of this means.

Does this all mean that I just receive the coupon rate up until the date of being called with interest accumulation ending at the call date? (Which I thought was just YTC).

investopedia: ""Yield to worst is a measure of the lowest possible yield that can be received on a bond that fully operates within the terms of its contract without defaulting.""

and

""If a bond is callable, it becomes important to look at the YTW. The yield to maturity will always be higher than the YTW (YTC) because the investor earns more when they hold the bond for its full maturity. The YTW is important though because it provides deeper due diligence on a bond with a call provision. The shorter time frame a bond is held for, the less the investor earns. YTW provides a clear calculation of this potential scenario showing the lowest yield possible.""

So, in my example above, YTM, YTC, and YTW are all the same. That doesn't make sense to me.

747,investing,"**TLDR: Why not Fed rate hike to 10%, but only with conditions of possible quick rate cuts to 2-3% for sure, and potential QE, if warranted?** 

=============================================================

So first of all I dont have Ph D in economics or not even remotely close, so bear with my ignorance. 

Going to what I want to say, and as we have witnessed that headline CPI is plummeted significantly in last 6 months, but core CPI is rather sticky and hold the line quite well. In fact, when looking at truflation data, CPI is creeping up in to 2.6% last 2 weeks. 

With this in mind, core CPI is more about service industry (i.e: travel/insurance/housing/medical expense) that often doesnt have strong basis for cost of goods sold. Unlike manufacturing jobs, service industry has no strong hold for consensus in terms of pricing. 

For example, it's like Amazon Prime membership that used to be 99$ before pre-pandemic. AMZN says it's increasing membership fee due to reason X,Y,Z but it all depends on how they net out the profits from online activity as well. What about Amazon's prime membership costs 140$, but Costco membership costs 120$? Who sets this up and for what reasons? 

Having said that, why not Fed consider madman's theory? Like let's say Fed officially announce that it may rate hike to 10% but only with multiple condition 1) that it will rate hike to 10% in next 4 months 2) depending on outcome of macro economy (i.e job reports/CPI/etc), it may not only reduce rate to 2%, but start to do QE if needed.

This will, obviously, bring chaos to financial markets (short term treasury rate will spike) and inevitable market corrections. This will also force many bankruptcy for leveraged business and many negative consequences to real economy. But, I believe that this will restore fed's credibility, which is the most important strategic assets to have in financial markets.  

But who actually trusts Fed today? Dont we all clearly remember that in late 2021, Fed expecting to rate hike, maybe early 2023? And we all know what happens in 2022. 

Like I am just so sick of one day that Morgan Stanley's talking about recession only to find out that next day Goldman Sachs talking about removal of hard landing. And this isn't much different than what we hear about governors of Fed says otherwise like one day Fed member says we are at the top of rate hike, but other day, another fed member says we should rate hike one or more.   


Current rate is 5.25 to 5.5% fed fund rate. 

Last CPI was 3.2% (headline) and 4.7% (Core), so current Fed rate is already high enough than Core CPI, isn't it? **According to Taylor's Rule, it should curb core CPI, but wouldn't it be painless if we can curb the expectations of inflation in a timely manner (rather quickly) than ""sit down and let's see what it will happen"".** 

Do I believe rate hike to 10% will increase the chance to crash the economy? Sure, that's why Fed should provide conditions such as quick rate cut to 2% if macros are proven to be crashing down. If that's factored in, maybe, the resilient economy that Fed members talk about all the time won't tank down as severe as they would think, which is why Fed can mention another conditions that they will (not could) do QE, IF needed. 

Just my thinking, but I wanted to see what other folks think about this as well.

752,investing,"I'm a 26yr M with a pretty good grip on stock investment knowledge. What makes a good investment etc etc. 
But recently with Treasury Bond yields at highs I've delved into some new research on them

I've always understood they're a long-term safe investment with a low-moderate yield. But now I'm seeing that you can buy bonds, get the yearly yield while you have it, and ALSO trade them in the process. The price of Bonds tends to increase as Fed interest rates lower, and decrease as Fed interest rates increase.

My question is: with bond yields so high right now, and the price of bonds going up when Fed interest rates go down, and a volatile uncertain market, it sounds like a REALLY great idea to put a ton of money in some bonds, get 5+% interest on them in the meantime, then when rates go down you can sell them at a profit.
I'm looking at 1month-1year Bonds. The 3-6 month Bonds seem like such a great small time window.

Is there any reason to not do this??

I haven't been able to see/find a chart of the price of bonds on the open market, only yield rates, so I don't actually know how much you can profit on a bond when Fed interest rates go down. A Futures chart isn't the open market price right? 
But overall I can't really see why I wouldn't do this unless I wanted way higher gains in the equities market. Which could also definitely happen when Fed rates lower.

757,investing,"Since no one can predict the future, the general wisdom is that it is best to hold a diversified portfolio.  

As far as equities go, one could just buy something like VT, and own everything in the world in a proportional weighting.   

But then you could also buy something like VTI and VXUS and balance the weight to be something like that of VT.   

And you could further divide up VTI into its various components (small, mid, large cap) and own funds for all of those, and do similarly for VXUS, perhaps also dividing VXUS up into different funds based on things like developed markets versus emerging markets, and so on.

My understanding is that a major part of diversifying is that at any given time, some things are winning and some things are losing.   If you need to cash in on some of your investments, you want to cash in when that investment is winning, so that you don't take a loss.   

It seems to me that if you have one giant generic fund (like VT), the losers are pulling down your winners at any given time, and the winners are pulling up the losers.   You get the average of all of that activity.  

On the other hand, it would seem that if you separate out the various components of something like VT, it gives you the flexibility to cash out only your winners when you need funds.  Intuitively, it seems that this would enable you to do much better than if you hold all your stuff in a single investment, and have to cash everything in at the same time.

I'm wondering if anyone can point to any good information on this, or offer any thoughts on this.   If this is the case, what would be the merit of owning very broad mutual funds/etfs and the like?   

The main argument I can see is that owning something like VT, or VTI/VXUS allows one to easily maintain a desired weighting combined with a sort of ""set it and forget it"" mentality.   It's less fiddly.   The more funds you get into (or even specific stocks... as that would give the greatest control, of course), the more you have to track things to make sure you aren't underweighting or overweighting certain parts of your portfolio, and that is not necessarily a small task.

On the other hand, if I use the same amount but split across 2-3 reits/etfs then I would receive less but more payment streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the best approach here?  If it is to focus on one, when do you stop adding funds to that reit/etf before allocating it to a new one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal was to use the dividends to reinvest back in to generate more income over the years. So taking this out to invest in a new stream I didnt really want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

767,investing,"Hi there, posted this in financial planning initially but thought I might get more replies here. I'm a married 37-year-old with a kid on the way. I'm in a creative/artistic field and although I've (thankfully) done very well, there are the occasional dry periods where I'm unsure of when my next check is going to come. Because of this, I'm toying with the idea of investing some money into high-yield dividend stocks and REITS, to help get some more consistent income during those dry periods, as I'm the primary earner in our house. Was hoping to get some advice on the below dividend strategy. Here's some additional info:

&amp;#x200B;

* Spouse (35) and I (37) both have well-funded retirement accounts. For the most part, 70% of it is in VTI and 30% is in VXUS. We'll continue this strategy with future contributions.
* I am fully vested in a pension that (as of today) will pay approximately $45K a year when I retire. I believe this number will go up. I'm eligible to start collecting at 52 for a reduced amount but plan to hold out until my 60s. Note: this pension is separate from our retirement accounts mentioned above.
* Spouse has a stable high-paying job. If we had to, we could afford all of our bills with just my spouse's income. It would be tight though.
* Despite my pension, I will be eligible for SS benefits as is my spouse.
* We have about two years' worth of emergency funds sitting in a HYSA (4.65%). Given the unusual nature of my work, I try to keep a healthy amount of rainy-day money available.
* We live in a HCOL area and our home is 30% paid off.
* We fully own one car (leasing another) and student loans aren't too far from being fully paid off.

  
As I mentioned, I'm looking to invest in some high-yield dividends and REITS into a taxable brokerage account to help with the dry periods. This isn't meant to replace a salary, but instead cover bills and ensure some additional income is available if needed. When I don't need this, I will be letting the dividends DRIP. Although ideally, these stocks will grow, my main focus with this portion of my investments is stable and reliable income. Here's are the stocks/REITS I'm considering, with each making up 10% of the portfolio:  

SCHD  
JEPI  
PFE  
0  
ABR  
VNQ  
WBA  
ARCC  
EPD  
MAIN  

Altogether, these would produce approximately a 7.04% dividend yield. I'm hoping this is reasonably diversified, though I realize there's probably some overlap. What are your thoughts on this strategy? Does this make sense given my situation? Are there some other stocks I should consider? Right now I'm diversified between ten stocks, would you expand that to 20 (with each making up 5%) for added protection? Please feel free to poke holes as I'm very much in the early research phase of this plan.

Hello everyone.   
This might be a silly question, but one I would like some answers to nonetheless.   
There is a stock I've been following lately and I have noticed the price has remained relatively flat for a while. Volume fluctuates but typically the price doesn't move.  
So, here is my hypothetical scenario question based on what I've seen with this stock-  
A company has 1M outstanding shares, and every day the volume fluctuates between 10k and 50k shares, the price per share doesn't change. Every day, the stocks are bought and sold at 5 cents.  
If I check the level 2 quotes and buy all shares available for 5 cents and hold them, then wait for more to be up for sale at 5 cents or less, and I continuously buy every share that is available at 5 cents or less, eventually, the stock wouldn't go below 5 cents? If I end up buying every share in the company and don't put them up for sale, will the price go up as people bid higher? Or will the price only hit what I'm willing to sell them at? If I choose to sell 10k shares at 10 cents but the highest bid is 8 cents, does the price say 10 or 8, or fall in the middle? Lastly, if I choose to sell at 10 but there are no bids, is the price 0?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone.&lt;br/&gt;

775,investing,"*A Random Walk Down Wall Street* by Burton Malkiel is known as a generally good starting point for people who are new to investingIt also, as it happens, had been recommended to me by a fellow redditor as an overall correct but not too dense book that will be of actual help to personal finance newbies that does more than regurgitate financial common sense. 

Even so, when I went into this book I really just expected it to rehash things I already read in other books but perhaps more thoroughly. I wasn't entirely wrong, a lot of information had in fact been repeated, but I also wasn't entirely right. Malkiel actually has something of a unique perspective when it comes to money management so I figure it's worth sharing some of what he has to say:

* **Before you are able to take advantage of market inefficiencies, you must know the ways that the market is actually efficient** \-  Investors fall into one of two camps: active investors who pick stocks and passive investors who buy index funds. For the most part, passive investors believe everything is priced in and it would be a waste of time to try to beat the market. Meanwhile, active investors generally believe that markets are inefficient and there are ways to beat the market, provided the correct technique, analysis, and/or research. Malkiel is more of a passive investor than active, not because he believes the market is perfectly efficient, but because he thinks the stock market is far more efficient than most active investors think. It's kind of like that old saying, ""you must first learn the rules before you can break them.""
* **Functionally speaking, the stock market is highly efficient in the short term...** \- Due to technology allowing us to constantly check on our portfolio's performance and investing professionals regularly being subjected to evaluations based on how much their investments appreciated in a given quarter, we tend to strive for short term gains over long term gains. The result is that in the short term, markets are highly efficient. Take for example the January effect, where stocks were consistently undervalued in January because people sold poor performing stocks in January in hopes of lowering their required tax payment. The moment this information was publicized, people rushed to buy stock in January and the renewed demand instantly erased the market inefficiency. To paraphrase Malkiel, if people know stocks will go up tomorrow, it will go up today.
* **But opportunities from market inefficiency arise in the long term** \- To clarify, by ""long term"" investing, I don't mean several months or even a year. Long term means several years, sometimes even several decades. Only in the long term do market inefficiencies correct and reveal itself as important. There are major hurtles to actually investing in a company long term. There's the difficulty of picking the right company, of needing funds for big purchases like a house, and the mental struggle of seeing the stock repeatedly and continually rise and fall in price as the years go on, constantly tempting you to sell. Because so few people are able to effectively select companies and stay invested in the long term, the market is actually much less efficient and so there are much more opportunities to beat the market. Just look at Warren Buffett.
* **Retail investors have several massive advantages over professional fund managers so don't get too discouraged when you hear that most professional investors don't beat the market** \- It's always in the wall street finance professional's interest to convince you that investing is difficult should be left to them. Malkiel disagrees, and cites several reasons for why you have an advantage over a large fund manager:

1. ***Many mutual funds aren't actually as motivated to beat the market as they should be.*** Although beating the market is ideal, it's far more preferable to get market returns than selecting stocks that perform worse than the market. For this reason, mutual fund managers sometimes just copy the index out of fear for their career. As an individual investor, you aren't doing it as a career and you aren't beholden to other investors. If you don't need the funds, you can afford to perform worse than the market for a quarter or longer in pursuit of better long term returns.
2. ***The size of a mutual fund means managers frequently have to put money in subpar companies so they're fully invested.*** It's much easier to invest $500 million in excellent companies than $50 billion - there just aren't enough investment opportunities. The cruel irony is that the better a fund manager is at generating high returns, the more people will want to invest in their mutual fund, thus ballooning the funds they have to manage and ultimately undercutting their effectiveness.
3. Another point about the size of mutual funds**:** ***when mutual funds buy stocks, it has an effect on the price.*** As a retail investor, you can buy and sell stocks for the marked price, but managers of large funds are forced to sell their stocks at a discount and buy at a premium simply due to the size of the transaction.

I should say that in this post, I've made it sound like Malkiel supports active investing. He does not. He's actually a proponent of buying index funds primarily, but also REITs, international index funds, and a bit of gold for diversification. I'm cherry picking points from the book which favors active investing because passive investing is much easier than active investing. For the passive investors reading this post, feel free to continue doing what you're doing with the knowledge that you have Burton Malkiel's full support. For the active investors, I hope some of the points raised here are helpful to you in your quest to beat the market.

Overall I found A Random Walk to be a helpful and interesting read. The book is somewhat long (the edition I read is 456 pages) so I've left quite a bit of it out due to necessity. If you guys have anything to add, definitely feel free. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; by Burton Malkiel is known as a generally good starting point for people who are new to investingIt also, as it happens, had been recommended to me by a fellow redditor as an overall correct but not too dense book that will be of actual help to personal finance newbies that does more than regurgitate financial common sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, when I went into this book I really just expected it to rehash things I already read in other books but perhaps more thoroughly. I wasn&amp;#39;t entirely wrong, a lot of information had in fact been repeated, but I also wasn&amp;#39;t entirely right. Malkiel actually has something of a unique perspective when it comes to money management so I figure it&amp;#39;s worth sharing some of what he has to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you are able to take advantage of market inefficiencies, you must know the ways that the market is actually efficient&lt;/strong&gt; -  Investors fall into one of two camps: active investors who pick stocks and passive investors who buy index funds. For the most part, passive investors believe everything is priced in and it would be a waste of time to try to beat the market. Meanwhile, active investors generally believe that markets are inefficient and there are ways to beat the market, provided the correct technique, analysis, and/or research. Malkiel is more of a passive investor than active, not because he believes the market is perfectly efficient, but because he thinks the stock market is far more efficient than most active investors think. It&amp;#39;s kind of like that old saying, &amp;quot;you must first learn the rules before you can break them.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functionally speaking, the stock market is highly efficient in the short term...&lt;/strong&gt; - Due to technology allowing us to constantly check on our portfolio&amp;#39;s performance and investing professionals regularly being subjected to evaluations based on how much their investments appreciated in a given quarter, we tend to strive for short term gains over long term gains. The result is that in the short term, markets are highly efficient. Take for example the January effect, where stocks were consistently undervalued in January because people sold poor performing stocks in January in hopes of lowering their required tax payment. The moment this information was publicized, people rushed to buy stock in January and the renewed demand instantly erased the market inefficiency. To paraphrase Malkiel, if people know stocks will go up tomorrow, it will go up today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But opportunities from market inefficiency arise in the long term&lt;/strong&gt; - To clarify, by &amp;quot;long term&amp;quot; investing, I don&amp;#39;t mean several months or even a year. Long term means several years, sometimes even several decades. Only in the long term do market inefficiencies correct and reveal itself as important. There are major hurtles to actually investing in a company long term. There&amp;#39;s the difficulty of picking the right company, of needing funds for big purchases like a house, and the mental struggle of seeing the stock repeatedly and continually rise and fall in price as the years go on, constantly tempting you to sell. Because so few people are able to effectively select companies and stay invested in the long term, the market is actually much less efficient and so there are much more opportunities to beat the market. Just look at Warren Buffett.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retail investors have several massive advantages over professional fund managers so don&amp;#39;t get too discouraged when you hear that most professional investors don&amp;#39;t beat the market&lt;/strong&gt; - It&amp;#39;s always in the wall street finance professional&amp;#39;s interest to convince you that investing is difficult should be left to them. Malkiel disagrees, and cites several reasons for why you have an advantage over a large fund manager:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many mutual funds aren&amp;#39;t actually as motivated to beat the market as they should be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Although beating the market is ideal, it&amp;#39;s far more preferable to get market returns than selecting stocks that perform worse than the market. For this reason, mutual fund managers sometimes just copy the index out of fear for their career. As an individual investor, you aren&amp;#39;t doing it as a career and you aren&amp;#39;t beholden to other investors. If you don&amp;#39;t need the funds, you can afford to perform worse than the market for a quarter or longer in pursuit of better long term returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The size of a mutual fund means managers frequently have to put money in subpar companies so they&amp;#39;re fully invested.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s much easier to invest $500 million in excellent companies than $50 billion - there just aren&amp;#39;t enough investment opportunities. The cruel irony is that the better a fund manager is at generating high returns, the more people will want to invest in their mutual fund, thus ballooning the funds they have to manage and ultimately undercutting their effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another point about the size of mutual funds&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;when mutual funds buy stocks, it has an effect on the price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As a retail investor, you can buy and sell stocks for the marked price, but managers of large funds are forced to sell their stocks at a discount and buy at a premium simply due to the size of the transaction.&lt;/li&gt;

It reported 2Q 2023 this week and was **trading at -28% from previous day close**

Here is a summary of Storskogen's financial performance based on their second quarter 2023 earnings release:

|Financial Metric|Q2 2022|Q2 2023|Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|SEK 9,059M|SEK 9,462M|\+4%|
|Adjusted EBITA|SEK 877M|SEK 922M|\+5%|
|Operating Profit|SEK 681M|SEK 605M|\-11%|
|Operating Margin|7.5%|6.4%|\-1.1pp|
|Net Income|SEK 474M|SEK 115M|\-76%|
|EPS|SEK 0.25|SEK 0.04|\-83%|

\- **Profit** for the period **fell 76%** to SEK 115 million.

\- The Trade business area saw lower consumer demand affecting sales and profits. The Services business area improved thanks to high occupancy rates. Industry continued to perform well.

\- Cash flow from operating activities increased significantly to SEK 852 million from SEK 335 million last year.- Net debt to adjusted EBITDA remained stable at 2.6x.

Overall, Storskogen delivered modest top line growth but profits declined amid a tougher economic climate mainly affecting consumer sentiment. The company maintained a strong financial position and cash flows improved markedly. Storskogen continues to focus on cash flow generation and profitability in the near term.

&amp;#x200B;

It is a good business and management seem to have a good track record in the field. Let's breakdown in simple words how they make money:

&gt;*Storskogen* is a conglomerate that owns a portfolio of small and medium-sized businesses across three segments - **Trade, Industry, and Services.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The **Trade** segment includes distributors and wholesalers of physical products like home furnishings, health and beauty items, sports equipment, etc. This segment generates revenue by selling these products to retailers or directly to consumers.  
&gt;  
&gt;The **Industry** segment contains traditional industrial companies involved in manufacturing, automation, and technology services. These companies make money by producing and selling various industrial products and solutions.  
&gt;  
&gt;The **Services** segment provides business-to-business services in areas like contracting, infrastructure, installation, logistics, and more. Revenue comes from selling these services to other businesses.  
&gt;  
&gt;Storskogen aims to acquire profitable niche businesses in these segments and help them grow further under its ownership. The operating companies charge their customers for the products or services provided.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the parent level, Storskogen derives profits from the earnings of all the operating businesses it owns. By having a diversified portfolio across segments, Storskogen can maintain stable cash flows as some segments may perform better than others in different market conditions.So in summary, Storskogen generates revenue through the sales of its underlying business units and creates shareholder value by acquiring, growing and operating a diverse mix of companies. The decentralized model allows each unit to focus on its respective industry and customers.

These are the companies they hold:

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt; segment contains traditional industrial companies involved in manufacturing, automation, and technology services. These companies make money by producing and selling various industrial products and solutions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Services&lt;/strong&gt; segment provides business-to-business services in areas like contracting, infrastructure, installation, logistics, and more. Revenue comes from selling these services to other businesses.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storskogen aims to acquire profitable niche businesses in these segments and help them grow further under its ownership. The operating companies charge their customers for the products or services provided.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the parent level, Storskogen derives profits from the earnings of all the operating businesses it owns. By having a diversified portfolio across segments, Storskogen can maintain stable cash flows as some segments may perform better than others in different market conditions.So in summary, Storskogen generates revenue through the sales of its underlying business units and creates shareholder value by acquiring, growing and operating a diverse mix of companies. The decentralized model allows each unit to focus on its respective industry and customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the companies they hold:&lt;br/&gt;

791,investing,"There are two ways to determine the value of something. One is for products, commodities, services, and similar items. The other is for financial instruments. In the first instance, the higher the utility derived from consuming an item, the higher its value. For example. More utility can be derived from a house, a precious metal, or a medical service, than from a tent, a base metal, or a cleaning service. That is why the first is more valuable than the second. Here however we are not interested in determining such value. Bitcoin is not a consumable item but an electronic database record. It belongs to the category of financial instruments because all such instruments are records, either paper or electronic. And in the case of financial instruments, value is determined based on payments and returns that an instrument can provide during its market life, at maturity, or at withdrawal. Let's now briefly demonstrate what that means by using the most widespread financial instruments - stocks, bonds, and fiat currencies. Then, we will determine the value of bitcoin.

During the market life of stocks, they pay dividends, while at their withdrawal for buybacks or due to liquidation of a company, they return capital to shareholders. The value here obviously depends on the size of those payments and returns. If a stock issuer can pay higher dividends and return more capital, the value of that stock will be higher, and vice versa. Bonds pay coupons during their market life and return face value at maturity. Here also, if a bond issuer can pay higher coupons and return more face value, the worth of that bond will be higher, and vice versa.

Fiat currencies pay nothing during their market life but they return items before their withdrawal from the market. Namely, when units of fiat currencies are created by loans from commercial banks or by purchasing government bonds from central banks, their beneficiaries use them to get products, commodities, services, and other items from the market. But as these units represent debt, the beneficiaries are forced to later return such items to the market to get the units for paying that debt. With debt payments, units are withdrawn from the market the same as bonds are withdrawn at maturity and stocks at buybacks or liquidation of companies. The value here depends on the size of the returns. If the beneficiaries can return more items, the value of a currency will be higher, and vice versa.

Now that we know how the value of financial instruments is determined we can turn to bitcoin. Let's first check for payments during market life. Does the issuer of bitcoin pay something like coupons or dividends to bitcoin holders? Well, no. Even in theory, this is not possible given that bitcoin is issued by a computer program, and not by some legal entity that must pay something. Let's then check for returns at maturity or at withdrawal. Here also, there is nothing to check. Bitcoin has no maturity and it is never withdrawn from the market to return something to its holders. It takes electricity when issued, but it never returns anything. As there are no payments and no returns, we can easily determine that the value of bitcoin is zero.

But what about all those narratives about bitcoin's value that circulate on legacy or social media? Well, they are just theories based on the misconception that the value of a financial instrument comes from the technology through which it is exchanged or its limited supply. Namely, given that bitcoin is easy to transfer, stored and protected in a decentralized manner, immutable, and limited in supply, the story goes that this somehow makes it valuable. But suppose that some stock broker implements the best possible technology for transferring and storing stocks. Would that change the value of these stocks? Would for example Tesla stock become mega expensive because of that? No, that is nonsensical. Such implementation would be unrelated to how much dividend Tesla can pay or how much capital it can return to shareholders. 

Or suppose that shares of a stock of a bankrupt company become limited in supply due to a reverse split. Would that magically make these shares valuable? No, given that the company has zero capital to pay or return something to shareholders. But if capital is above zero then the reduction of supply by a reverse split will automatically make shares more valuable. Limited supply affecting the value of a financial instrument presupposes the existence of value. However, just having a limited supply and nothing else cannot magically make value to appear. So, just because bitcoin as a financial instrument (electronic record) is limited in supply that doesn't make it valuable. But people are free to pay a million dollars for bitcoin just like they can do that for a share of a bankrupt company if they believe in the theory that limited supply can make value to appear. 

A lot of people have invested in bitcoin and understandably, a myriad of theories emerged about its value, with some of them being pretty weird and nonsensical. Like the one that confuses price with value and goes like this: ""The value of bitcoin is whatever someone is willing to pay for it"". According to that theory if one is willing to pay ten shares of a company ABC for one share of that company, then one share has the same value as ten shares. So pretty nonsensical. But people obviously have to rationalize their purchase of a worthless financial instrument, regardless of how unfounded their rationalizations are. After all, they have to sell it to someone else to return the investments. This forces them to invent or spread various theories about its value. In reality, however, the value of bitcoin has always been, and will always be zero. And everything that is going on around it is just the greater fool theory taken to the extreme.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to determine the value of something. One is for products, commodities, services, and similar items. The other is for financial instruments. In the first instance, the higher the utility derived from consuming an item, the higher its value. For example. More utility can be derived from a house, a precious metal, or a medical service, than from a tent, a base metal, or a cleaning service. That is why the first is more valuable than the second. Here however we are not interested in determining such value. Bitcoin is not a consumable item but an electronic database record. It belongs to the category of financial instruments because all such instruments are records, either paper or electronic. And in the case of financial instruments, value is determined based on payments and returns that an instrument can provide during its market life, at maturity, or at withdrawal.

\*\***Background:**\*\*Adyen is a company that provides payment processing and acquiring services to merchants. They work with third parties like financial institutions and network scheme providers to enable these services.The fees charged to Adyen by these third parties are known as ""pass-through settlement fees"", which include interchange and payment network fees.

|Financial Metric|H1 2022|H1 2023|YoY Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|€3,947M|€854M|**-78%**|
|**Net Revenue**|€609M|€739M|**+21%**|
|Operating Income|€331M|€279M|\-16%|

|Free Cash Flow|€309M|€248M|\-20%|
|Cash Balance|€5,584M|€6,412M|\+15%|

The significant decline in revenue was due to the change in revenue recognition methodology for settlement fees in 2023. Net revenue, which excludes settlement fees, increased 21%.

\*\***Previous Policy**:\*\*Up to December 31, 2022, Adyen considered itself primarily responsible for providing payment transaction services. This means they had control over the full settlement service before it was transferred to merchants. In accounting terms, Adyen acted as the ""Principal"" for these fees. When acting as a Principal:Adyen would recognize both the revenue from the fees charged to merchants and the costs from the third parties on a gross basis. This means both the revenue and the costs were shown in full in the financial statements.

\*\***Change in Policy**:\*\*In H1 2023, Adyen made changes to its terms and conditions related to merchant agreements. These changes clarified the roles and responsibilities of the services provided by third parties. The key points from this change are:Adyen does not provide a significant service of integrating the services from third parties into one combined output for the merchant.Adyen does not control the inputs from third parties before services are provided to the merchant.Because of these changes, Adyen now acts as an ""Agent"" for the pass-through settlement fees, effective from January 1, 2023.

\*\***Impact of Acting as an Agent**:\*\*When acting as an Agent:Adyen only recognizes the net amount (i.e., the difference between what they charge the merchant and what they pay to third parties) in the revenue. This means the gross revenue and the costs from third parties are no longer shown in full in the financial statements.

\*\***Financial Impact**:\*\*Looking at the financial data provided:In H1 2022 (before the change), Settlement fees were €3,641,350 and Costs incurred from financial institutions were €3,313,269.In H1 2023 (after the change), Settlement fees dropped significantly to €485,582, and Costs incurred from financial institutions were only €74,409.This drastic reduction is because, in 2023, Adyen is only recognizing the net amount in the revenue, whereas in 2022, they were recognizing the full gross amount.

This is how the Revenue growth in the last 9 Yrs looks like:[https://snipboard.io/1vM0jO.jpg](https://snipboard.io/1vM0jO.jpg)

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;strong&gt;Previous Policy&lt;/strong&gt;:**Up to December 31, 2022, Adyen considered itself primarily responsible for providing payment transaction services. This means they had control over the full settlement service before it was transferred to merchants. In accounting terms, Adyen acted as the &amp;quot;Principal&amp;quot; for these fees. When acting as a Principal:Adyen would recognize both the revenue from the fees charged to merchants and the costs from the third parties on a gross basis. This means both the revenue and the costs were shown in full in the financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;strong&gt;Change in Policy&lt;/strong&gt;:**In H1 2023, Adyen made changes to its terms and conditions related to merchant agreements. These changes clarified the roles and responsibilities of the services provided by third parties. The key points from this change are:Adyen does not provide a significant service of integrating the services from third parties into one combined output for the merchant.Adyen does not control the inputs from third parties before services are provided to the merchant.Because of these changes, Adyen now acts as an &amp;quot;Agent&amp;quot; for the pass-through settlement fees, effective from January 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;strong&gt;Impact of Acting as an Agent&lt;/strong&gt;:**When acting as an Agent:Adyen only recognizes the net amount (i.e., the difference between what they charge the merchant and what they pay to third parties) in the revenue. This means the gross revenue and the costs from third parties are no longer shown in full in the financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;strong&gt;Financial Impact&lt;/strong&gt;:**Looking at the financial data provided:In H1 2022 (before the change), Settlement fees were €3,641,350 and Costs incurred from financial institutions were €3,313,269.In H1 2023 (after the change), Settlement fees dropped significantly to €485,582, and Costs incurred from financial institutions were only €74,409.This drastic reduction is because, in 2023, Adyen is only recognizing the net amount in the revenue, whereas in 2022, they were recognizing the full gross amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how the Revenue growth in the last 9 Yrs looks like:&lt;a href=""https://snipboard.io/1vM0jO.jpg""&gt;https://snipboard.io/1vM0jO.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As far as I understand, bond ETFs:

1. Hold a diverse set of bonds with different maturity dates
2. Don't hold bonds until maturity; instead, they sell bonds before maturity and buy new ones.

Now, when selling such a bond fund, there is a possibility of losing money if interest rates increase. To overcome this, there is a neat strategy: after selling my bond fund holdings, I can either:

1. Buy back all the individual bonds in the ETF and hold them until maturity (which is almost impossible to do).
2. Buy an equivalent amount of bonds with a duration that is equivalent to the average duration of the bond fund. Because the bond market is efficient, the price paid will be more or less the same as in option 1.

The problem is that buying individual bonds is not that easy for a retail investor. That's the reason I am buying a bond ETF in the first place. There are minimum requirements (like a minimum of $50k), spreads can be large, etc.

\[Very brief\]  
  
If you are long SEA I’m sure you saw the horrendous drop this morning on the news of them coming in light on revenue expectations. I personally feel like this drop is completely overblown and management’s ability to emphasize profitability and add to their cash pile over the last two quarters shows great discipline and flexibility in a changing market. They even profitably grew e-commerce by \~21% YOY and digital payment by \~50% YOY.   
  
I did a conservative sum of the parts analysis this morning where I compared SE’s three segments to comparable companies to show where a potential bottom could be and to hopefully help investors (myself) not panic sell due to this overblown move. I used P/S ratios because I don’t think EBITDA or earnings are entirely meaningful yet in the company’s current stage. **I also used a run rate for 2023 and did not assume any further growth, as to be as conservative as possible in forming the base case.**   
  
**Summary:**   
  
**Garena:**   
  
Scenario 1 - Steady State: Comparing Garena to Tencent’s P/S ratio on a 2Q23 annualized basis, so assuming no growth for the rest of 2023 but keeping the same run rate, the valuation for Garena should be \~$5.5B.   
  
Scenario 2 - P/S Comp Reduction Slashed by 50% due to Continual Decline (Ultra Conservative): Using the same assumptions as above, the value of Garena would be \~$2.7B. I believe this is ultra conservative because as we saw today, overall gaming metrics are starting to improve i.e. MAUs and % of paying users, and I think with the new title launches, should continue into future quarters.   
  
**Shopee:**   
  
Using the run rate for 2023, so again, assuming no growth, the value for Shopee is \~$14B  
  
**Sea Money:**   
  
Using the run rate for 2023, so again, assuming no growth, the value for Sea Money is \~$1.9B. I believe this is extremely conservative. I don’t think the comps (PYPL, STNE) quite capture the growth and opportunity of Sea Money due to the rapid growth and high growth region, as the P/S average used was \~2. Fintech has been under pressure recently, but historic P/S comps have ranged from 6 to 12, so if you do the math, the valuation here is much higher on a realistic basis.   
  
**Conclusion:**   
  
On a straight across basis, assuming Garena (and the other segments) keep the current run rate for the year, the valuation of the sum of the parts is \~$21B. Cutting the multiple in half for Garenas decline gives us \~$18B.   
  
That being said, these valuations assume no additional growth in the other segments, simply keeping the current run rate. That being understood, I think where it’s sitting now at $23B could be argued to be the fair price/intrinsic value, which would make sense in an efficient market.  
  
**Personal Thoughts:**  
  
It’s gut wrenching to watch a company drop like SE did today, but it’s important to table emotions and remember the game you’re playing. SE operates in a market that is going to see continual and immense growth for decades to come, well above the GDP growth % for most of the developing world. They have strong market leadership in e-commerce and even with entrants like TikTok, can still materially grow that business year over year due to low overall e-commerce market penetration.   
  
As discussed in the call, they’re also pivoting back into a growth mode for Shopee as to keep up with competitors in the region. This should boost the Shopee revenue growth rate as well as capture more sellers/buyers in the Sea Money ecosystem, providing a two-fold growth engine.   
  
I personally am going to hang tight with my 50% paper loss and wait for a lower price to add to my position (as crazy \[or not\] as that sounds). If it went any lower from current levels, especially as low as \~$18B I would see this as a clear opportunity to invest heavily, especially as the region is expected to recover in 2024 and beyond and as discussed above, I believe the gaming segment is going to continue to stabilize through the EOY.   
  
Would love to know what everyone’s thoughts are, whether long or short. GLTA.  
  
**TL;DR** \- SE is down but certainly not out. A great company that had expectations set too high in the short/medium term, but has a great growth story laid out in front of it.

I used portfolio analyzer and made 3 portfolios. 

1 - 100% US stock market
2 - 100% EX-US
3 - 100% US large cap growth

Started with $500 and every month contributed $500 starting in my starting year (I kept increasing starting year by 1 to see how they performed). 

It works starting 1986 even if you select 1972 (graph starts in 1986) 

My ending portfolio balance was always higher for portfolio 3 (QQQ is it?). Then portfolio 2 (VTI) and then portfolio 1 (VXUS). 

I still have to play with ending years - am I totally looking in the wrong direction?

Edit: outcome is almost the same if I start in 1997 and end in 2011. $90k contributed and end with approx $120k after 13 years.

Investors, 

I'm an American living in Korea, age 33. I'm exploring financial options like getting an index fund started through interactive brokers. (There are better ones, but these guys are the only ones accepting Korean Won into other currencies) 

In the meantime I'm also trying to invest long term in foreign bond markets, for Old Me. Due to me living out here, my options are stymied because I'm not a citizen and the Korean Won doesn't really play well with others...

I feel I shouldn't grab any Yankee Bonds because of the high interest rates, so I'm thinking about Arirang Bonds or Samurai Bonds. I haven't done much research into this, beyond a few links from investopedia. Before I invest some chips, im hoping for Second and Third opinions. 

I have a 2yr foreign savings account from won to USD with an exchange bank, it takes ₩1,000,000 every month from my income. I still have about ₩600,000 left after expenses and food.

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I&amp;#39;m also trying to invest long term in foreign bond markets, for Old Me. Due to me living out here, my options are stymied because I&amp;#39;m not a citizen and the Korean Won doesn&amp;#39;t really play well with others...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel I shouldn&amp;#39;t grab any Yankee Bonds because of the high interest rates, so I&amp;#39;m thinking about Arirang Bonds or Samurai Bonds. I haven&amp;#39;t done much research into this, beyond a few links from investopedia. Before I invest some chips, im hoping for Second and Third opinions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a 2yr foreign savings account from won to USD with an exchange bank, it takes ₩1,000,000 every month from my income. I still have about ₩600,000 left after expenses and food. Its just coffee money, so I should do something meaningful with it. Any constructive advice is appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
