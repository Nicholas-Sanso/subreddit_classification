18,investing,"30 year Treasury Bonds are yielding close to 4.7% right now. This will almost certainly be beat out by the market over the longterm, but what if you buy longterm treasuries but only hold them for a short(ish) term. 

The federal funds rate is (in my opinion) nearly peaked. I believe there will be 1 more rate hike this year and possibly 1 more in early 2024 before the Fed pauses and then begins reducing the federal funds rate down to the ~2.5% mark around 2026/2027. At this point, wouldn’t all of the treasury rates fall significantly from their current highs? This in turn would mean that the higher yielding treasuries bought today would be sold a significant premium because they would still have 25+ years to maturity at a significantly higher rate than what could be bought at auction. 

If I did my calculations correctly, a treasury yielding 4.7% with 27 years to maturity would be trading at a ~21% premium if the market rate for new 30 year treasuries drops to 3.5%. So if these assumptions are true, you would get a 4.7% annual return on your investment + an additional 21% return at the end of 3 years for a 35.1% return over a 3 year period on a risk free asset. 

I know I have to be missing something and I can’t check historical data on on treasury CUSIPs since I don’t have access to a Bloomberg terminal.

Lets say I have a balance of 10k on Jan 1st 2023 and I do a loan for it all. I stop further contributions, and the loan is paid back by December 31 2023.

I know of course you pay a 10% penalty on a withdrawal if you’re under 59 1/2 and you have to pay taxes on it.

28,investing,"Americans have a terrible saving rate no doubt, yet we are still complaining we don’t have enough money to save because insufficient disposable income, or we don’t need to save as the ultra-low interest rate will eat all our deposit’s return. Therefore the optimal option is to enjoy the spending and go back to the government when running out of money.  
I agree that we have been in a time of sluggish household income growth, and of inevitable decline in purchasing power thanks to the constant inflationary environment plus reckless monetary policy, but I also think that personal savings will do a lot of good to the overall performance of your portfolio, even though you may think saving detriment your money pool, because you have no idea what an opportunity cost is. 

Think about these:

  
**Saving helps you build up your wealth**, particularly when you just started off investing. We all know that we have a good chance of financial freedom by shinning investment returns, but we don’t know high saving rate also provides a good chance for it too.   
Say you and I both have an annual gross income of $50,000, akin to ordinary people we save only the leftover after expense on living necessities, what differentiates us are the following two things:   


1. How much leftover we have: I hold that life is too short to be wasted so I am not interested in keeping a large sum of money in my banking account, $5,000 each year is way too good for me, yet you are down to save $10,000 each year and willing to half your needs.   


2. I am a bit smarter and having more luck than you, that makes my annual return rate tripled outperform yours by 10% each year (lets say 5% vs. 15%). You just need to buy a few CDs or long term bonds but I gotta be working extremely hard (guys if I can make 15% annual return over the next 10 years I will be on TV).   


Then what will we have after 10 years?  
Use the Excel formulas then, I made $117K, but you will have $132K.  


**Saving is not hard,** I may still fail to realize 15% 10-yr CAGR after having a master degree on finance but you don’t have to be educated to know how to save. You just had a best time than I ever did bro.  
Saving is a certainty, but investing is not. You are saving $100 if you put $100 in your account, I may lose all if I bought, lets say $100 AMC shares.  


**Saving also enhances our flexibility**.  
The variables in our life is incalculable. Sometimes it brings luck, sometimes is just not that good, we have to learn to accept the reality even though it could blow us off the ground.  
But if you have some flexibility, at the very least you will have a soft landing when you are falling: you don’t quit the job at the expense of quitting the investment, you don’t pay the emergency bills at the expense of quitting the investment, and you don’t even have to ask someone for a hand because you have some in your saving account. You will feel less impatient and less unsecured. It brings some security to your life, and that is good.

The immediate thought is doing a Backdoor Roth IRA and... I got myself into a bit of a pickle here. About a year ago I rolled over an old 401K into a Groundfloor (Peer-to-Peer Lending) Traditional IRA and I'm in the process of transferring most of the cash over to an Traditional IRA on Fidelity.

However... I have have $5K left in the Groundfloor ""LROs"" and all but $450 are non-performing or in default. 

If I understand correctly if I want to do a Backdoor IRA the ""pro rata"" rule applies and I'll need to calculate pre-tax and post-tax allocations. This also means I'll be paying tax on $4.5K of money that I'm probably never going to see again. This feels like a bad idea. 

So until those losses are reflected on the Groundfloor IRA I see myself having two options: 

  * Contribute to a Traditional IRA and don't take a deduction, or
  * Contribute to a Brokerage Account

I'm strongly leaning towards the latter as I feel it gives me flexibility while not losing too much of a tax advantage.

They have always maintained since last year that they are not much affected by recession, probably because their primary customers are upper middle class folks.

The price has fallen from 46-47 just before the earnings to 33 as of now which is a massive drop. PE ratio is just about 15 and there's no negative news about them.

Country: USA

Employment: Students

Objectives: Purchase a house and prepare for the future as we are so young. 

Time horizon: Since we are both 23 the time horizon is however long. However we would like to buy a house asap so we dont have to rent anymore. 

Risk Tolerance: 100% safe I assume? I want it to be secure obviously. 

Current holdings/assets: No assets. We are 23. 

Debts: Around 100k in student loans. (Her debt) (I have no student debt)

How should we go about investing this money for our future and purchasing a house so we dont have to pay rent?

I just started learning about investing in real estate and the stock market. I wanted to know which option would theoratically yield more profit. I wanted your input and correction on this small calculation I did to compare the 2 over a 15-year span. Your help would be appreciated.

Assuming a person has 100,000 to invest, which option would provide the highest return, real estate or the market?

  
I invested 100,000 in both in this spreadsheet and invested the same amount over the 15 years. (Ex: If I need 20,000 to cover my mortgage and expenses on the home I bought, I invest the exact same amount in stock)

Two commonly used orders, the sell limit and take profit orders, may appear similar at first glance, but they have distinct roles in the world of trading.

  
**Sell Limit Order**  
Think of a sell limit order as your golden ticket to ride the market's upswing. With this order, you set a specific price at which you're ready to sell an asset. However, here's the catch: the order will only execute if the market price climbs to or surpasses the price you've set.  This order type is particularly handy for traders who anticipate an asset's price will rise before potentially reversing.

  
**Take Profit Order**  
Take profit orders – your safety net for locking in profits. When you place a take profit order, you're essentially setting a predetermined price at which your position will automatically close, securing your hard-earned gains. It's like having a financial safety net that ensures you don't get too greedy and risk losing your profits.

I think it might be a bit much so I was thinking of dropping the small cap and VTI.

85,investing,"Hi everyone,

Three years ago, I started forcing myself to gain some financial literacy, because I had literally NONE. It's been a great journey from squandering my grandfather's inheritance, building up my credit card debt (the higher the number the better, right?) and being delinquent in paying capital gains tax. Well at this point, I'm debt free and have been investing for 18 months.

  
r/personalfinance was my introduction to the index style of investing. I read some Bogle literature and opened an IRA with Vanguard. My holdings are currently 90% VT, 10% AVUV and I intend to keep it mostly that way. I might diversify my SCV with another Avantis fund, but not more than 10% SCV total. I contribute $542/month, so this will be my second-year maxing contributions. 

  
In considering time horizons for different purposes, I realized that if I don't make a line item in my budget for a house downpayment and put it in treasuries or something, it will never happen. Even though it's controversial, I elected to invest these funds in equities for a 5-10+ year time horizon. If it's a bear market I'll just keep renting, whatever. I'm not comfortable borrowing from my IRA and I wouldn't borrow from my 401K either if I had one. Basically, I opened a brokerage account with Vanguard and contribute like $80/month. Of course, I'll up that number soon, but that's where I am. My holdings are 65% VTI, 20% QQQM &amp; 15% VXUS, but I'm having other ideas in line with value investing. 

  
To narrow down exactly what I'm asking, this account is for a specific purpose, a house. I have a separate chunk of money I keep in a MMF that is for buying my next car in cash, which will likely happen within the next 3 years (Toyota at 248,000 going strong). A set dollar amount each month goes into that account. My plan is that once I have to buy my next car, I'll immediately start INVESTING (not saving) the equivalent of a car payment each month. I'd be investing that money because I shouldn't need another car for 12-15 years. Depending on what the market is doing, I could even move some to bonds 5 years out. The crux of my question is: Does it make sense to keep this NEXT car fund money in a separate brokerage account from the home downpayment funds, or is it more practical if I lump it all together? I like the idea of having separate accounts for different purposes, but I wonder if I'd be missing out on some compounding gains by doing that. I don't know if the extra account would be worth the headache. 

  
Since I'm using more of the indexing approach with my IRA, I'll probably keep it with Vanguard. For the brokerage account, I've thought about moving it to Fidelity simply because they allow you to buy fractional shares. I don't like that Vanguard only lets you buy whole shares of non-Vanguard funds. I just ordered ""The Intelligent Investor"" and am planning on learning how to do a proper valuation. I want to build a portfolio of good companies (and at least 50% VTWAX!) that are on sale. Some will likely be buy and hold for a long time, some may just be a couple or a few years if I decide to trim winners or write off losers. Something is always on sale. I want to be able to pick a few companies, conduct a thorough valuation and allocate an equal percentage of a given lump sum to each. I might not even keep my allocation of individual companies above 10%. If it does well, it'll fund my safer investments. If it goes poorly, then I'm sure I'll take away a powerful life lesson somehow.   
Any suggestions are welcome. Have a great weekend!

# From Finch Beaks to Financial Peaks: Understanding Genetic Algorithms

Remember high school biology where you learned about Charles Darwin and his theory of natural selection? Darwin studied finches in the Galápagos Islands and noticed that they had different beak shapes, each finely tuned for their specific diets — some for cracking seeds, others for sipping nectar, and yet others for capturing insects. Over time, the finches with the most useful beak shapes survived and had baby finches, passing along their “winning” traits.

In the realm of computational science, particularly in the domain of optimizing algorithms, a similar evolutionary process takes place through a methodology known as genetic optimization. Imagine you are developing an algorithm to forecast stock market behavior. Various iterations of your algorithm demonstrate distinct strengths: some may excel in volatile environments, while others may be optimized for long-term trends. Genetic optimization acts as the computational equivalent of the Galápagos Islands; it identifies the top-performing strategies and combines their most effective features to create a new generation of even more robust algorithms.

# The Six Pillars of Genetic Optimization: A Biological Symphony in Code

Imagine you’re on the Galápagos Islands, watching a group of finches go about their lives. Some have beaks crafted for nectar sipping, while others have sturdy beaks perfect for cracking seeds. These distinct features aren’t random; they’re survival tactics, granting each bird access to a specific food source. Now, consider a finch family with both long and short-beaked parents. They have four chicks, and by a stroke of genetic fortune, one inherits a beak even longer than her long-beaked parent. This unique feature gives her exclusive access to deeper flowers, while her siblings with mid-length beaks struggle to specialize in either nectar or seeds. In this harsh survival game, her specialized feature gives her the upper hand. Yep, it’s survival of the fittest, Darwin-style.When we think of genetic optimization, we’re essentially talking about a six-step process, repeated over and over until we achieve our optimal solution. These steps are:

1. **Initialization**: Setting the Population and Fitness Metrics
2. **Selection**: Choosing the Fittest Candidates
3. **Crossover**: Mixing Traits (Recombination)
4. **Mutation**: Introducing Random Changes
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the New Generation
6. **Replacement**: Swapping Out the Old for the New

In this exploration, we’ll delve into each of these pillars to understand how the age-old wisdom of biology serves as the muse for modern algorithmic optimization. Each of these steps, intricately modeled after natural processes, works in concert to refine and evolve our algorithms toward the pinnacle of performance.

**Initialization: The Genesis of Algorithmic Optimization**

In the natural world, every ecosystem begins with a diverse population — be it finches on an island, bacteria in a petri dish, or whales in the ocean. In the realm of computing, our “population” is what we aim to optimize, and it’s often encoded as a string of numbers.Consider the world of algorithmic trading: we kick-start the process with a variety of trading portfolio strategies. Some might be conservative, triggering stop losses at a mere -3% and aiming for gains at +3%. Others might be more adventurous, with stop losses set at -30% and profits at +30%. These different portfolios make up our initial population.

After we have an entire population, we’ll convert each of our portfolios into an array of numbers. This is especially important for later parts of the algorithm like selection and mutation.

[We create many variations of a portfolio, then convert them into an array or tree-like structure](https://i.imgur.com/vuWpTBB.png)

After we have our population of individuals, we need to decide what it means to be a “fit” individual. For algorithmic trading, one way we can do this is by running trading simulations or backtests. We can then use the performance of the backtest and optimize for certain metrics, like sharpe ratio, percent change, or drawdown.

[We can optimize for different metrics, including percent change, maximum drawdown, and sharpe ratio.](https://i.imgur.com/KsrA3yb.png)

**Selection and Crossover — How our strategies “breed”**

Just as nature selects the fittest organisms to carry on their genes, so does our algorithm pick the best portfolios for the next generation. Though selection can be random, more often, it leans towards those that are ‘fit,’ or in our case, portfolios that perform well based on our chosen metrics.For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say individuals in a population mate at random. In our portfolio example, that means taking a random pair from the population and combining their genetic information.

[Two common forms of Crossover are “Random Crossover” and N-Point Crossover. The important thing here is that an offspring that looks like both parents is generated](https://i.imgur.com/ETp6kvw.png)

We perform this crossover operation tens, hundreds, or thousands of times. One common heuristic is to generate a new population that’s the same size as the old population. With that, we’ve now doubled our population size. Incredible!

**Mutation — Introducing Variation in the Population**

Let’s return to our Galápagos finches. Mutations in their genetic code might lead to subtle changes in beak size or shape. Most of these changes may be inconsequential or even detrimental. But every so often, a mutation could result in a beak perfectly suited for a previously untapped food source, allowing a finch lineage to dominate a new ecological niche.In the algorithmic world, mutations serve a similar disruptive yet constructive purpose. They introduce randomness into the genetic optimization process, helping to avoid local minima and explore the vast landscape of possible solutions. Just like biological mutations, algorithmic mutations can sometimes produce undesirable outcomes. However, on occasion, they can bring forth truly ingenious solutions that would not have been achievable through conventional methods. For example, in an algorithm designed for trading, a mutation might alter the parameters used to calculate the optimal point to buy or sell a stock. While this change may initially appear random and potentially harmful, it could unlock a strategy that significantly outperforms its predecessors.In practice, a mutation is typically performed by altering one or more elements in the array that represents a portfolio or any other object of optimization. The extent and impact of this mutation can vary widely. A “soft” mutation might involve the adjustment of a single parameter, such as the percentage at which a stop-loss order is triggered. In contrast, a “hard” mutation could involve significant alterations to multiple elements in the array, akin to a large-scale genetic mutation in a biological context. It is worth noting that the absence of physical constraints in the computational domain allows for a greater range of possible mutations compared to biological systems.

[A mutation alters the offspring in some way that’s distinct from characteristics of their parents](https://i.imgur.com/s5zGI8S.png)

Both in nature and in algorithms, mutations serve as one of the critical mechanisms for driving evolutionary progress, pushing boundaries both in the organic and digital realms.

**Evaluation and Replacement**

In biological ecosystems like Darwin’s Galápagos Islands, the process of evaluation is a relentless one, executed by the natural environment. Those organisms ill-suited to their surroundings — such as finches with beak shapes that do not facilitate efficient foraging — find their survival and reproductive prospects severely compromised. Conversely, organisms exhibiting advantageous traits not only survive but also pass these traits to subsequent generations, contributing to the evolutionary success of their lineage.Drawing a parallel to algorithmic trading, the evaluation phase serves a comparable function. Here, each portfolio, optimized for particular market conditions, undergoes an exhaustive evaluation process. This involves running a series of backtests and simulations that quantify their performance based on specific metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, percent change, and maximum drawdown. These metrics function as the ‘fitness criteria,’ allowing us to identify which portfolios are most capable of meeting or exceeding predetermined trading objectives.

[We convert the child back to a portfolio and evaluate its performance](https://i.imgur.com/iXh8iN3.png)

Upon the completion of the crossover and mutation stages, the newly created ‘child’ portfolios are reintroduced into the existing population. Each member of this augmented population is then evaluated based on the aforementioned performance metrics. Subsequently, the entire population is sorted in descending order of their fitness scores. To maintain population size and focus the evolutionary pressure, the least fit individuals are culled, leaving a new generation of portfolios that is incrementally superior to its predecessor.

[Evaluate the performance of all portfolios in the population, then retain only the top-performing ones, thus ensuring that each new generation is more fit than the last.](https://i.imgur.com/abKpe8z.png)

I am a new investor. I have only been studying investing for a couple months now. I’m 30m for reference. I invest currently in VOO and VXUS with an 80/20 split through Robinhood. I am going to continue to do this for my retirement (as my current job doesn’t offer a company 401k). 

However, I want to dabble in a little trading that will net a decent return in the short term, which I plan to reinvest in my VOO and VXUS. 

MGM was at $50.77 per share on July 1st of this year. Then came those cyber attacks, which have rightfully made people nervous and as a result (at least in my mind), the stock closed today at $36.54 per share. 

With football in season and the rise of sports betting, I believe this stock will recover at least a little bit, particularly since this mess with the cyber attack has been resolved and slowly, people may start feeling more confident patronizing an MGM establishment again. 

Not saying I would hold this one long term, and while it hit its all time high back in 2007, am I wrong in thinking there is still a bit of money to be made investing a couple grand into this stock and holding till it hits $50 or so again and selling it? Seems like an almost-sure, nearly 30% gain is to be had here (which is how much it dipped since the onset of the ransomware attack).

108,investing,"Hello all,

I am a 28F and hired a FA after graduating medical school. After our second meeting, he proposed starting an IUL with 6 figures (I've acquired money from an inheritance). After initial meeting, I was happy with the decision until I received the paperwork. It could've been written in another language for all I know, because it was 52 pages long of terms I've never heard of. 

I got cold feet and ghosted my FA, asking for a couple months because something seemed off. The pitch he gave me was the IUL was too good to be true and that's what set off alarms in my head. If this was so great, why weren't more people doing it? Why is it legal? How is the company keeping any money if they have allocate millions for death benefits?

We took a couple months break and reconvened a few days ago. I told him no to the IUL, but he spent another hour pushing me to do it, but recommending we do less money. I am put off by the persistent texts, emails, ""this is time sensitive, so get it back to me in 2 days"" knowing it was 52 pages long and I have no idea what I'm reading.

He said if the insurance company doesn't return with a great rate for me, we won't go through with it. However, I still feel like I'm being duped.

Please let me know your advice because my gut is telling me to run. How would you handle this situation?

Thanks so much.

Edit:

Thanks for all of the replies! I am most likely not going through with the IUL since I've had bad feelings about it since it was introduced. I will look into meeting with Schwabb (my parents did business there and recommended them to me before I moved out), so I'll most likely have to break up with my current FA. I will also read the resources you've given me and try to find a plan that works best for me given my medical school background and future doctor salary.

- Car ($10,200 paying $726/month)
- Home repair ($12,000 paying $190/month)

Can anyone give me a recommendation on how to distribute my contributions amongst the below funds, so it focuses about 65% on US total market, with ~25% global total market and ~10% tech fund holdings? I&amp;#39;m not too interested in the Fidelity Freedom Index funds that are target retirement date funds with higher expense ratios as I am very much active in my rollover IRA and comfortable doing that long term, however the funds offered below are making it difficult for me to recreate my rollever IRA strategy.

123,investing,"You’ve probably heard that coal is bad for the environment and the economy. That investing in coal is like throwing your money into a pit of fire. That coal is a dying industry that has no future.

But what if I told you that there are still some reasons to consider investing in coal? That coal might not be as doomed as you think? That coal could actually offer some opportunities that other sectors don’t?

Before you downvote me to oblivion, hear me out. In this post, I’ll explain why investing in coal might still be a smart move, despite the stigma and the challenges.

**Why the Stigma?**

Let’s start with the obvious: coal is one of the dirtiest sources of energy. Coal-fired power plants emit huge amounts of air pollutants and greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change and health problems. Coal mining also damages the environment and endangers the lives of workers.

That’s why there’s been a global shift toward renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro. These sources are cleaner, cheaper, and more sustainable than coal. They also align with the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria that many investors look for.

**Economic Reality**

But here’s the thing: coal still accounts for about 27% of the world’s total energy supply. And in some regions, especially in emerging markets and less developed countries, coal is still the main source of electricity. Why? Because coal is cheap, abundant, and reliable. It can provide a lot of energy with a small amount of fuel.

As the world population grows and more people need access to electricity, the demand for energy will increase. And while renewables are the future, they may not be able to meet this demand fast enough. Renewables depend on weather conditions and storage capacity, which can limit their availability and scalability.

That’s where coal comes in. Coal can fill the gap between the current and future energy needs. Coal can provide a steady and consistent supply of electricity, regardless of weather or time of day. Coal can also support the development of other industries that require a lot of energy, such as manufacturing and mining.

**Hedge Against Volatility**

Another reason to invest in coal is that it could serve as a hedge against market volatility. With everyone jumping on the renewable energy bandwagon, these markets could become oversaturated and unstable. The prices of renewable energy stocks could fluctuate wildly due to supply and demand imbalances, technological disruptions, or regulatory changes.

Coal, on the other hand, is an unpopular and undervalued sector. There’s less speculation and hype around coal stocks, which could make them more stable and predictable. Investing in coal could help you diversify your portfolio and reduce your exposure to risk.

**Technological Advancements**

You might think that coal is an old-fashioned and outdated technology that has no room for improvement. But that’s not true. There are actually some innovations happening in the coal sector that aim to make it cleaner and more efficient.

One example is carbon capture and storage (CCS), which is a process that captures CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants and stores them underground or in other locations. This way, CO2 doesn’t enter the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. CCS is not perfect, but it’s a step forward in reducing the environmental impact of coal.

Another example is high-efficiency low-emissions (HELE) coal technologies, which use advanced boilers and turbines to burn coal more efficiently and produce less emissions. HELE coal technologies can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 35% compared to conventional coal plants.

By investing in coal today, you could be indirectly investing in the future of cleaner fossil fuel technologies. You could be supporting the research and development of solutions that could make coal more compatible with environmental goals.

**Dividends and Valuations**

Finally, one of the most attractive reasons to invest in coal is that it offers high dividends and low valuations. Because coal stocks are unpopular and underappreciated, many of them are trading at low prices relative to their earnings and assets. This means that you could buy them at a bargain and potentially sell them at a profit later.

Moreover, many coal companies pay generous dividends to their shareholders as a way to reward them for their loyalty and patience. Dividends are regular payments that companies make from their profits to their investors. Dividends can provide you with a steady income stream and boost your returns over time.

For long-term investors who are looking for value and income opportunities, coal stocks could be a good option.

**The Risk Factor**

Of course, investing in coal is not without its risks. There are many factors that could affect the performance of the coal sector, such as:

Regulatory changes: Governments could impose stricter environmental regulations or carbon taxes on coal producers or consumers, which could increase their costs and reduce their profits.

Environmental activism: Environmental groups could pressure coal companies or their customers to switch to cleaner energy sources, which could reduce their demand and market share.

Renewable energy growth: Renewable energy sources could become more competitive and widespread, which could lower the price and demand for coal.

Coal supply and demand: Coal prices and production could vary depending on the availability and quality of coal reserves, as well as the global and regional demand for coal.

These risks are real and significant, and you should not ignore them. However, they are not unique to coal. Every sector has its own risks and challenges, and you should always do your own research and analysis before making any investment decisions.

**Conclusion**

Investing in coal is not a popular idea, but it might not be a bad one either. There are still some reasons to consider investing in this sector, such as:

Meeting the immediate global energy demand

Hedging against market volatility

Benefiting from technological advancements

Enjoying high dividends and low valuations

Investing in coal is not for everyone, and it’s not without its risks. But if you’re looking for an unpopular opinion that could pay off in the long run, you might want to give coal a second chance.

&lt;p&gt;Another example is high-efficiency low-emissions (HELE) coal technologies, which use advanced boilers and turbines to burn coal more efficiently and produce less emissions. HELE coal technologies can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 35% compared to conventional coal plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By investing in coal today, you could be indirectly investing in the future of cleaner fossil fuel technologies. You could be supporting the research and development of solutions that could make coal more compatible with environmental goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dividends and Valuations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one of the most attractive reasons to invest in coal is that it offers high dividends and low valuations. Because coal stocks are unpopular and underappreciated, many of them are trading at low prices relative to their earnings and assets. This means that you could buy them at a bargain and potentially sell them at a profit later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, many coal companies pay generous dividends to their shareholders as a way to reward them for their loyalty and patience. Dividends are regular payments that companies make from their profits to their investors. Dividends can provide you with a steady income stream and boost your returns over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For long-term investors who are looking for value and income opportunities, coal stocks could be a good option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk Factor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, investing in coal is not without its risks. There are many factors that could affect the performance of the coal sector, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory changes: Governments could impose stricter environmental regulations or carbon taxes on coal producers or consumers, which could increase their costs and reduce their profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental activism: Environmental groups could pressure coal companies or their customers to switch to cleaner energy sources, which could reduce their demand and market share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewable energy growth: Renewable energy sources could become more competitive and widespread, which could lower the price and demand for coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal supply and demand: Coal prices and production could vary depending on the availability and quality of coal reserves, as well as the global and regional demand for coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These risks are real and significant, and you should not ignore them. However, they are not unique to coal. Every sector has its own risks and challenges, and you should always do your own research and analysis before making any investment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in coal is not a popular idea, but it might not be a bad one either. There are still some reasons to consider investing in this sector, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting the immediate global energy demand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hedging against market volatility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefiting from technological advancements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoying high dividends and low valuations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in coal is not for everyone, and it’s not without its risks. But if you’re looking for an unpopular opinion that could pay off in the long run, you might want to give coal a second chance.&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s what I have at the moment:

$12k in checking account
$10k in 401k (haven’t been contributing but I am maxing it out this year and should have ~$28k by the end of the year) 
$20k in Roth IRA 
$103k in individual brokerage 

Much of my holdings have been in ARK ETFs (I know this was an awful decision, but I was young and made some poor choices). 

I’m wanting to exit those losing positions hopefully soon and sort out how else to allocate those funds. I will probably have the Roth IRA managed by my retirement company once I exit those positions so I don’t have to worry about it. I’ll also be getting quite the tax harvest from the selling the positions in my brokerage account. 

With all the losing positions I sell in my brokerage, I’ll have ~40k of cash to do whatever with. The other ~$63k is invested in TSLA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, AMD &amp; AMZN. I have a $30k position in TSLA, so that’s most of it. 

I’m thinking about taking the $40k I get from my losses and putting it in a HYSA, but not sure that would be the best thing to do. I think it would certainly be much less stressful than investing over $100k myself, but I also don’t think I’ll need the money very soon. 

I’m single and currently live in Denver (I hate it here), and would love to be able to go to a warmer place, potentially San Diego if I can afford it. I don’t know much about buying a house nor do I feel confident enough in a city to buy one, so still renting for now. My rent is 2.3k here, and would be much higher in a place like SD. I’m hoping to get a decent raise soon that would be closer to $200k, but not sure if it’s gonna play out yet or not.

131,investing,"Hi Folks,

I'm having a bit of trouble wrapping my mind around a financial concept, and I would be extremely appreciate of any insight some of you might be able to offer.   


I'll do my best to explain the situation to you in a concise way. Here it goes:  


I'm trying to determine how much to invest each period in a long-term hold strategy. Specifically, I'm trying to make guesses with a time value of money calculator as to how much my investment will be worth in a few decades. For this example, I assume I'll receive 10% back on my investment per year (on average over many years) before inflation is accounted for. I'll also assume that inflation is 3% on average, per year. I have been viewing my investments as making 7% to account for the 3% inflation in my example. 

However, if I am letting money sit for a long period of time (let's say 30 years), and I invest $2,000 each month at the beginning of the period, it doesn't take long before the interest earned on the principle of my investment will far outpace my expected monthly cash outflows in my overall personal budget, adjusted for inflation.  


Does it seem proper to look at my investment as much x% rate of return - y% rate of inflation? I ask because what boggles my mind is the point where my investments earn more interest in a period than I plan to spend in that same period. I understand the idea that inflation will make a dollar in the future less valuable than a dollar today), but for some reason, I can't help but think that I might be missing a key concept about rate of return vs. inflation  since at some point, the inflation on my monthly consumptions won't keep pace with the interest earned on a large enough principal balance (inflation adjusted).  


I hope that this makes sense. I have an accounting background, and I should know the answer to this, but I don't and  it's been gnawing at me for awhile. Maybe there is a term for what I'm trying to ask about, or maybe I have a poor understanding of time value of money and I'm looking at this problem incorrectly.

In may 2021 I purchased a $700,000 townhouse with my roommate at a 3.5% interest rate. We planned to stay together for two years and then rent out the house as we go our separate ways while retaining 50/50 ownership. The time has come to make a decision. 

We are exploring property management company options, but between all the costs (management fee, pmi, mortgage, etc.), we will still be in the red by about $800 total (or $400 each) every month. Making some very generous assumptions (5% annual rent increase, consistent tenants, minimal repairs) we’ll be cash flow positive in about 5 years. 

We are both in comfortable positions career and life wise, and can reasonably expect stable jobs, full contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, full emergency funds, and enough to spend living enjoyable lives otherwise. 

The final factor is selling to OpenDoor, whose initial offer estimate is 832,000, but could be up to $885,000. In a best case scenario, selling to opendoor would net us both about $100,000, not factoring in what we’ve paid into the house so far. Zillow estimates our house at about $750,000, for reference, which I personally think is a far more reasonable assessment. 
 
So, the question comes down too if the monthly “investment” into the house will give greater returns than elsewhere, like S&amp;P. Not to mention we both need to agree on the same course of action. 

I’m inclined to keep the house as a form of diversification, but would appreciate input and thoughts from y’all, such as any experience selling to OpenDoor, co-owning a property with a friend, or any other of the unique investment choices I’m currently facing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, slightly unique situation here and would love to take in some general opinions or advice&lt;/p&gt;

144,investing,"Hi everyone,

I have a slight issue with understanding how the MIRR function behaves. I have read this [very useful paper](http://homepages.rpi.edu/~guptaa/MGMT2320/Handouts/ModifiedIRR.pdf) advocating the use of MIRR instead of IRR, but unless I am mistaken there is one weakness of the MIRR function that is not reflected.

From what I understand, and this is confirmed by manually doing the math, the MIRR function discounts investment outlays at a hurdle rate, compounds cashflows at an reinvestment rate (usually the WACC) and finds the IRR that makes the sum of the discounted investment outlays and the compounded cashflows equal to zero (this is the MIRR). Thus far, all good.

What I have a problem with is the behaviour of the function with the hurdle rate applied to future investment outlays. Consider this stream of cashflows: **year 0.** $(1,000,000); **year 1.** $500,000; **year 2.** $500,000; **year 3.** $550,000 and **year 4.** $(300,000). 

With a 10% WACC (ie, reinvest rate), the *MIRR* sensitivity to the **hurdle rate** is thus: **15%** - *12.5%*; **20%** - *13.1%*; **25%** - *13.7%*. The higher the perceived risk of the investment, the higher the MIRR because the investment outlay in year 4 is more discounted. Is this not problematic? If I deem a project riskier than usual, I should apply a higher hurdle rate, but this would yield a higher MIRR, leading me to prefer this project rather than another, less risky, just because distant investment outlays are more discounted. This is not intuitive to me and I would be happy to read your views on this. Many thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

What happened was parent 1 died, parent 2 died 5 months later but never claimed parent 1s assets.  So I had to make an estate and lay claim to them.  I had no issue getting inherited IRA from parent 2 assets.

Now, illinois has a 4m exception clause for total estate.  Fair market value is just under 3m.  So we appear to be good on state taxes.  But these fed tax is going to hurt a lot.  I've looked up fed exemption and it states 12m. But all the firms are taking a 10% federal tax minimum and filing it with the estate EIN number.

Does this mean the money comes back after I file 2023 taxes?  Is their some way to avoid these 10% fed tax?

&lt;p&gt;All these assets are getting a minimum 10% federal tax.  Not even sure on the illinois tax ( everyone involved lives in Illinois)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, illinois has a 4m exception clause for total estate.  Fair market value is just under 3m.  So we appear to be good on state taxes.  But these fed tax is going to hurt a lot.  I&amp;#39;ve looked up fed exemption and it states 12m. But all the firms are taking a 10% federal tax minimum and filing it with the estate EIN number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean the money comes back after I file 2023 taxes?  Is their some way to avoid these 10% fed tax?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I am in the wrong forum.  The goal is to move these assets to my tax advantage accounts if possible.  Then my brokerage accounts if not/maxed tax avoidance possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who say anything bearish are banned. If you decide to sell your shares after something like bankruptcy is announced, you&amp;#39;ll be shunned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not trying to victim blame here. Uneducated people can fall for this stuff simply because they don&amp;#39;t know better and they like to be a part of a community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for those of you reading this who aren&amp;#39;t too far gone into the conspiracy theories, please be careful. &lt;strong&gt;Remember, if your investment thesis is good, it can handle criticism from others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to bring up the stocks you&amp;#39;re invested in here to get some ideas on what others think.

I have never bought any funds for larger amounts and I have the possibility to invest $130,000 
I have a vanguard account and I bought VMFXX for  $3000 

I want safe ( no risk to lose the capital) but I was wondering if I should diversify. If yes how and why ?
I was looking at IRA too
I am not sure what % of the total amount I should invest, if it’s best to invest in various funds or not 

What would you do ?
Thank you 😊

I'm in my early 40's so I haven't seen high interest rates much in my time of investing. So here's my question... When there's a GUARANTEED 5%+ return with HYSA's, CD's, and MMF's, why not park a large part of your investments/cash into those? I get that the market tends to beat that but we also have quite a few market headwinds that we're dealing with right now and will have to deal with.

My other question would be, if you disagree with this and are still investing, is there a interest rate number that would  make you consider changing your mind? If HYSA's and MMF's got up to 7%? 10%? Where's the tipping point?

Sorry in advance on formatting, I’m writing this on my phone. 

My wife (28F) and I (35M) are going to be diversifying from apple and would love your opinions. I will give a brief background about us and also our financial situation. 

My wife is finishing her masters program in the spring of 24 and will be making about 100k a year. She will have about 70k in student debt. I am in tech and earn about 175-250k with zero debt. We have 1 daughter who is 3 years old. We live in a HCOL area in Northern California and fortunately have a paid off residence. 

The allocations below are held in a trust which took a 90k loss last year and gives us the opportunity to reduce allocation % in apple. Essentially we will be selling 90,000 in capital gains (roughly 690+ shares) and diversifying. 

(Trust)
Apple shares - 3,250 ($572,975)
Shwab CD - $125,000 (4.1% &amp; expiring in October 2023) 
Cash - 14.5k

Personal brokerage 
Apple shares - 620 ($109,306)
Nvidia shares - 15 ($6,720
Tesla - 10 ($2,670)
529 account - ($4,000)
VTI - $22,420 (Roth ira)
401k - $101,000 (VTSAX)
Cash - 35k

Our Schwab advisor is pushing for a self directed index through Schwab. The Schwab advisor  wants us to harvest losses in the future so we can diversify apple to even out the allocations. Minimum investment amount is 100k into this self directed index fund. Our longLong term goal is wanting to have a 10-15% allocation in apple. 

My question to the group is, what should my next step be? I’m a little skeptical about a self directed index fund because it’s a Schwab robo advisor with .4% fees. Should i just sell 75% of the entire trust and VTI or VOO it? We are very fortunate to be in this situation but are losing sleep at night with everything in 1 stock.

229,investing,"I am a large holder in $sq and have never seen such an improving business with such a dissociated stock price. 

When $sq was $52 in 2018, it’s revenue was $750m a quarter, or $3b a year. It has since 8xed it’s revenue, and is now doing $5.5b a quarter (2x it’s YEARLY REVENUE in 2018) or $22b revenue a year. Same exact stock price, dropping lower as we speak and hitting new 52 week lows.

This would be somewhat reasonable if SQ was showing negative growth (even then it wouldn’t be justified) but here’s why I think it should be a lot higher. 

1.) BTC in 2018 was $3.3k, cashapp has been offering BTC sales since Jan. 2018, today the price is $27k, so an 8x increase. This doesn’t even include the amount of users they’ve grown using the service.

2.) BNPL is on fire. As the recessions looms consumers are taking on debt to fuel their habits, great for Square’s afterpay and afterpay is hitting new revenue highs. Affirms stock price is crushing it while square slips to new lows.

3.) Monster Cash-app growth. In 2018, Square’s Cash-app was doing 400M in revenue a year, it is now doing 12 BILLION a year in revenue, with 3B of that being GROSS PROFIT. A 30X or 3000% revenue increase! 

4.) Square Terminals: In 2018, Square terminal revenue was $300m a year. Today, it’s 1.5-1.7b. A 500-600% increase 

5.) Unlike other growth stocks, it did not grow off the hands of the pandemic. An example of this would be Fiverr or Etsy, clearly it’s growth stems from people trying to make money at home. Squares growth is organic, while a lot of other growth stocks are superficial.

6.) As the recession looms, consumers will slowly flock away from everything that damages their wealth. With cashapp you can send money and not have to worry about chargebacks (like PayPal) and it’s completely free. 

Before anyone comments, I know the company has diluted shareholders but every company does this and when you configure it into actual percentages it’s a lot lower than other companies since the market cap of $sq is so high.

Tl;Dr Since 2018, Squares stock price has been the same but all biggest lines of it’s business have improved revenue between 400-4000%. 


There has to be a reason it’s constantly underperforming and hitting 52 week lows today. There is little to no short interest on the stock so people selling it are actually pressing the button.

Strong core inflation, higher energy prices combined with resilient consumer demand and a still strong labor market means the Fed will most likely hike further in coming months. It's also expected that the Fed will raise their 2024/2025 dot plot chart outlining more hikes.

I'll have 600k in taxable brokerage that I need to last 15-20 years at a fixed $30k inflation adjusted withdrawal rate. I understand this is larger than the recommended 4%, but after 20 years then I can pull from some of my tax advantage accounts where I'll be at a safer withdrawal rate. I also plan to Roth IRA convert in this period of low taxation and if SHTF I can always go back to work as well, which is why I am taking this risk.

Ideally I'd like to avoid early withdrawal penalties on my tax advantaged accounts, but in order to do that I need to hedge against sequence of returns risk while also still allowing enough growth to support a 5% withdrawal.

My plan; **65% VOO, 10% AVUV, 25% BND**.

**No international?**

I do not think the US will under-performed the international market - opinions can be adjusted if I see it fit.

**Why large cap?**

I invested heavy into VOO and I can't just convert it to VTI and pay the capital gains taxes, nor do I think VTI vs VOO is that much different. I think medium and small cap add volatility and I'd like to have more control over that.

**Why small cap value?**

I think with the high CAPE ratio, I am forecasting may see a period where value stocks outperforms growth like in years before the latest bull market, which is why I wanted some value.; so that is where AVUV (small cap value) comes in where I pick up small cap and I add some value to help with sequence-of-returns, this also helps my portfolio get away from being so tech heavy (VOO) and more into finance where I think there is value but also growth potential.

**Why 25% bonds?**

Monte carlo suggest this much bond allocation is ideal for my needs of needing a 5% withdrawal but hedging sequence of returns.

When/if the market is down in the early years I plan to sell BND for more VOO to ride the uptick when it eventually comes.

256,investing,"Coke or Pepsi? These two companies have dominated the soft drinks industry for over a century. Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. A famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that some argue they have shaped modern marketing. Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, it's hard to say that today. Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.

So, which company is the better investment choice? We all know that Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, making up almost 7% of his portfolio. Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead? 

[Historically, Pepsi's total return has been higher than Coca Cola's.](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) That's been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let's take a look at the latest earnings. 

# Latest Earnings

At the end of July, [Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%,](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. Meanwhile, [Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6% and revenue estimates by 2.7%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi's stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then. 

# Valuation Metrics

Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. [Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), whereas [Pepsi stands at 24](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke's 9.6.

# Margins

The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. [Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) than [Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D)which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola's margins are more stable than Pepsi's, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that's a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.

# Capital Structure

The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of \~$250B and debts of \~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B).

However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke's $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it's nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.

Since that's the case, let's look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. [Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi's outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, [Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi's stock price has been doing better than Coke. 

# Dividends 

Coke does have a [better dividend of 3.2%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that's not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don't see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there's just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster. 

That's exactly what we see with Pepsi. [Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), that's true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke's at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list. Pepsi's payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don't think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%.

At this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but they are almost identical. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it's raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.

# Technical Analysis

Now, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can't really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi's price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn't closed below it. I think that's a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn't been doing too well. It's down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola's price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we've see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola's price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.

# Price Targets

My personal valuation models put Coca Cola's fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that's somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. [The Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.

On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That's a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi's free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That's why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can't say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. [Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.

# Final Verdict

Now, what's the verdict here? To me, it looks like the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I'm not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don't have any positions in either of these and I don't think I'll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%.

That's my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?

**TLDR; Pepsi looks better technically, Coke has a better valuation, but neither are really at a good price point for new entrants.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke or Pepsi? These two companies have dominated the soft drinks industry for over a century. Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. A famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that some argue they have shaped modern marketing. Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, it&amp;#39;s hard to say that today. Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, which company is the better investment choice? We all know that Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, making up almost 7% of his portfolio. Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Historically, Pepsi&amp;#39;s total return has been higher than Coca Cola&amp;#39;s.&lt;/a&gt; That&amp;#39;s been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let&amp;#39;s take a look at the latest earnings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Latest Earnings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of July, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%,&lt;/a&gt; but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6% and revenue estimates by 2.7%&lt;/a&gt; while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi&amp;#39;s stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Valuation Metrics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22&lt;/a&gt;, whereas &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi stands at 24&lt;/a&gt;. However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke&amp;#39;s 9.6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Margins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi&lt;/a&gt;which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola&amp;#39;s margins are more stable than Pepsi&amp;#39;s, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that&amp;#39;s a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Capital Structure&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of ~$250B and debts of ~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke&amp;#39;s $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it&amp;#39;s nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that&amp;#39;s the case, let&amp;#39;s look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases&lt;/a&gt; (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!).

Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi&amp;#39;s stock price has been doing better than Coke. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dividends&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coke does have a &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;better dividend of 3.2%&lt;/a&gt;.

Given the current price of $58, that&amp;#39;s somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;The Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars&lt;/a&gt; and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That&amp;#39;s a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi&amp;#39;s free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That&amp;#39;s why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can&amp;#39;t say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi&lt;/a&gt; with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Final Verdict&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what&amp;#39;s the verdict here? To me, it looks like the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I&amp;#39;m not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don&amp;#39;t have any positions in either of these and I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR; Pepsi looks better technically, Coke has a better valuation, but neither are really at a good price point for new entrants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Basically I was making the case that stocks were a good deal even though they appeared overpriced based on the CAPE index since bonds and gold were much more overpriced. 

Here’s how the predictions turned out.

Prediction: Stocks are not overpriced on a relative basis/still a good investment:

Result: Nasdaq has averaged around an +8.1% annually in the past 3 years

Prediction: Gold is not a good investment because of the historically high gold to platinum ratio at the time.

Results: Gold returned -5.9% annually

Prediction: Bonds are overpriced / not a good investment

Results: Bonds have been the biggest loser in the past 3 years. Not sure exactly what metric to show on this but in 2022 alone 30 year US treasuries lost 39.2% of their market value.  The total bond index lost 13% in 2022.

Here’s a good reference index: Vanguard total bond market index VBMFX  annual return -7.1%

Overall: pretty accurate!  Just wish I zeroed in more on real estate as the winning option!

But as I started to learn more and more about investing, I got introduced to factor investing and tilting and realised after learning that a small cap value tilt might actually be better than the initial percentage division I had. However, I do understand that many YouTubers/finance experts online advocate more for the large cap growth as an agressive mode of investment than a small proportion of them advocating small cap value. 


I'm just curious if my thought process in this decision makes sense: I buy 40% VOO as a broad index. I buy 10% Large cap growth in order to not miss out on the performance gains right now in the market. I buy 15% small and mid cap for slight tilt and 15% small cap value tilt as they perform the best in long term according to theory. The remaining 20 I use it for international with 10% of it for emerging and 10% of it for developed ex US. 


This way I'm thinking I could get exposure to what's in the peak right now(large cap growth) and use a best theoretical performer(small caps and small cap value) and also diversify with international so during us recession my portfolio doesn't go to 0. 


Btw, I have specifically avoided large value also because they have more dividend advantage which I cannot fully grasp being in a non US country which taxes dividends. Searching small cap growth has just given me bad results all over the internet so I'm skeptical of that too. 


Any advice helps. Thanks

I'm an Underwriter and am very concerned about consumer loan defaults when student loans come due in October.

I am an underwriter at a small credit union, would love to hear how other institutions have been handling federal student loan borrowers over the last few years. 

My institution has been counting the payment as $0.00 per month during the pause, but obviously these will come due soon. If you're in banking, has your bank/credit union been calculating their normal payment, or have you also been putting it as $0.00?

I am concerned with liquidity. We have been giving out loans like candy at very high rates. Once borrowers start having to pay $400 (national avg) to their student loans again, I am concerned we will begin to see a large wave of defaults on auto loans and repossessions and foreclosures, as so many people paid exorbitant prices the last 3 years, when they otherwise wouldn't have been approved that much with an active student loan payment. 

My director doesn't seem concerned, but to me, mathematically, it's gotta be a ticking timebomb. Thoughts? I think I want to short the banks, but I don't see anyone talking about it other than saying money will get tight for people. You can't repossess a student loan, and if the wave of defaults starts, and again I believe it... almost *has* to, then.... big crash of the banks and consolidation like post-'08. I'll probably lose my job.

I'm not a smart investor. But I know income, outcome, assets, and liabilities - and the math doesn't math.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m an Underwriter and am very concerned about consumer loan defaults when student loans come due in October.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m in my mid 20s, and I’ve been investing for 2.5ish years. I began to run into investing subreddits recently and have become aware that I’m missing the mark with a lot of what I’m doing. I’m only looking for long term investing advice. I have questions and would appreciate any help you provide. Here is where I’m at…

- Schwab Intelligent Portfolio
    - 70% stocks (FNDX, SCHX, FNDE, FNDA, FNDF, VOO, etc), 20% fixed income (SCHI, VMBS, SCHR, etc), 2% commodities (IAU), 8% cash
    - Do I just pull out of this portfolio? I’ve heard plenty of redditors mention it’s holding you back because of the cash percentage. Also, I don’t believe it’s the best investment strategy long term. If I do pull out and sell my investments here, while I’m at a loss, do I get taxed still? Not entirely sure how selling works because I haven’t sold anything since I started

- Schwab Personal Brokerage
    - Started this before the intelligent portfolio, and I still have some investments here. Ironically, this portfolio has consistently been doing better than the intelligent one.

- Roth IRA
    - Started investing into my Roth IRA this year. I don’t quite think I’ll max it out this year, but my plan is to do so going forward. I made the mistake of not understanding it, and it hasn’t been invested into anything since I began it months ago.
    - What do I invest my money here in? VTI/VOO? Something else? Also, am I allowed to transfer money from my brokerage accounts to my Roth IRA? I can probably max this year if I do that. 

- 401k
    - invested all in Vanguard target 2060. Should I keep this or change what I’m doing?
    - I will not max this either, but I will maybe increase my contributions to it going forward

- Regular savings account
    - Have saved about 5-6 months worth of expenses in case of emergency

I probably have 4% of my money in Roth IRA, 47% in brokerage accounts, 31% in 401k, 18% in savings account. I have a feeling I’m not doing this well, and I would appreciate more experienced investors to help me get on the right track.

I’m in my 20s and I understand the power of compounding interest and aim to invest in S&amp;P for the remainder of my working career.

I’m in the UK and currently invest each month in an investment ISA with Hargreaves Lansdown.

My question is - is there any merit in having investment ISAs at several company’s e.g. having another ISA open with vanguard. 

Is there any dangers with investing exclusively with one company? Is there any better way to do it?

I can't make 10,000 trades/sec the instant that news is released. I've realized this a lot more this year, I'm a software developer and I started working at a financial company so I've gotten a taste of what that looks like.

So what advantages do us individual investors have? I've thought of a few, and would be interested in hearing any other considerations.

* Lower position sizing - Don't need to invest $50 mil per trade, so can invest in smaller companies that large institutions wouldn't bother with.
* No bureaucracy - This doesn't apply to HFT systems, but you don't have to get approval and can move more quickly in some cases or react to events.
* Personal Experience - You can invest in what you know or have knowledge about from your day-to-day life that others may not have.

322,investing,"I have a good job.  I make about $125k a year but invest about $20k - $30k+ of that money every year.  So I probably live on $95k or less.

I've been doing this a long time and have a substantial retirement portfolio built up in an IRA.

There is some potential (maybe 50/50) that my company will lay me off inside a year.  If I have to find a new job at this time, I will likely take a pay cut, and/or have to move to a new place.  Potentially forfeiting the 2.875% mortgage on my current house and trying to buy a new house in this insane market.

On the other hand. . .

If I invest aggressively, I could generate maybe $200k+ per year in income off the portfolio.  Some back of the envelope math says I could:

* Take out $150k per year
* Pay taxes and penalties on this withdrawal that would leave me with maybe $115k after everything
* Reinvest the other $50k into more conservative investments.
* By the time I'm actually old enough to withdraw from the account, I'd have more than $1M in conservative investments built up (assuming an 8%) rate of return.  Plus I'd have my original portfolio balance.
* I also have a pension worth about $2k a month if I take it at 57, or $3k if I wait until 62
* Social security will take a substantial hit since I'm skipping a decade+ of my most profitable working years.

Pros I see:

* I can retire at 47
* I'll have a substantial and growing retirement fund until I hit normal retirement age
* If I get laid off I don't have to sweat taking another job, possibly at a paycut and uprooting my life if I have to move

Cons I see

* There's some risk here . .  the income could drop, the value of my investments could drop.  I wouldn't lose everything, but could easily take a 20% haircut.  I see the chance of this happening as low.Also, with each passing years that goes ok, my conservative investments build, reducing the risk.  I think the biggest risk to this strategy is in the first 3 years.

If something drastic happened, I cal always go back to work, although, as noted, I'll probably take a paycut.  I have some other retirement accounts I wouldn't touch either.  As a backstop as well.

* That's a lot of money to hand over to the government in taxes (which I'd have to pay eventually anyway) and penalties (which I'm choosing to eat in exchange for not having to work for a living a decade+ early.)
* My social security would take a substantial hit from missing my most profitable years of working
* My wife works, makes about $65k, and would want to retire also.  But for various reasons this could be ok if it didn't happen for another couple years.  However, she would walk away from a pension of about $25k per year if she retires before another 6 years.  She wouldn't want to wait.

This is only a potential fall-back plan.  If my employer doesn't lay me off, I'm happy to continue working.

But if they do. . .I'm seriously considering trying this and just checking out of the workforce.

""The European Central Bank on Thursday announced a 10th consecutive hike in its main interest rate, as the fight against inflation took precedence over a weakening economy.

The unprecedented series of rate rises has now hauled the central bank’s deposit facility from -0.5% in June 2022 to a record 4%. **A key reason for the hike appeared to be upward revisions in newly-published staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which see inflation averaging at 5.6% this year, 3.2% next year and 2.1% in 2025.**""

Here are the main rates that got raised again:

\- ECB Interest Rate Decision (Sep): **4.50%**  (previous 4.25%)

\- ECB Marginal Lending Facility (Sep): **4.75%**  (previous 4.50%)

\- ECB Deposit Facility Rate (Sep): **4.00%**  (previous 3.75%)

While some seem to be thinking this will be the end of ECB hiking, we all know if new inflation data comes in higher than expected they will continue to hike.

You read that right! On August 24 (NZST), we successfully launched our 40th Electron mission, called “We Love the Nightlife,” for Capella Space. Not only did we deliver Capella’s satellite to orbit, but we also demonstrated some significant milestones in evolving Electron into a reusable rocket. 

  
For the first time, we reused a Rutherford engine that had previously flown on our “There And Back Again” mission in May 2022. The engine worked flawlessly on its second flight as it took Electron to space. Then the first stage returned to Earth with a successful ocean splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. 

  
Hot on the heels of “We Love the Nightlife,” we’re launching another dedicated Electron launch for Capella. The ‘We Will Never Desert You’ mission is scheduled for lift-off from Launch Complex 1 as soon as 19 September. The mission will be our third launch for Capella this year – we're on a roll!

**Rise &amp; Sign: New Launch Deals Signed!**   


  
There must have been something in the air in recent weeks because we’ve announced 14 new launch deals across our Electron and HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) programs.    
**Here’s a look at what’s to come:**   
New HASTE launch for an undisclosed customer to take place at Launch Complex 2 (LC-2) in Virginia in 2024. We successfully launched our first HASTE rocket in June for Leidos on a mission called Scout’s Arrow. Learn more about HASTE! (HASTE rocket) 

  
Four new HASTE missions for Leidos under the MACH-TB program, scheduled to launch from LC-2 across 2024 and 2025.  

  
BlackSky, a leading provider of real-time geospatial intelligence and global monitoring services, which has launched on six Electron missions since 2019, signed a block buy deal for five Electron launches for their Gen-3 satellites beginning in 2024. Fun fact: BlackSky has used Electron as a launch vehicle more than any other single commercial customer!    


  
A new, double-launch deal with NASA to deliver their climate change research-focused mission, PREFIRE, is now scheduled to launch in May 2024. NASA's PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) mission will help close a gap in understanding of how much of Earth’s heat is lost to space, especially from the Arctic and Antarctica. This will be our 7th and 8th mission for NASA since 2018. (Graphic we made of 2 launches)  

  
Last but not least, we signed a deal with Japanese Earth imaging company Synspective to launch two dedicated Electron missions. Rocket Lab has been launching for Synspective since 2020 when the Company deployed the first satellite in Synspective’s synthetic aperture radar (SAR) constellation. Since that first mission, Rocket Lab has been the sole launch provider for Synspective’s StriX constellation to date, successfully deploying three StriX satellites across three dedicated Electron launches

Rocket Lab received the prestigious Industry of the Year Award at the Hancock Chamber Business &amp; Industry Awards Gala in August. The annual awards recognize outstanding achievements in citizenship, industry and business in Hancock County, Mississippi.    
We opened our facility at the Stennis Space Center in 2022 and the site will be used to test the new Archimedes engines for the Neutron rocket coming in 2024.   
When we expanded our Space Systems division, we created a vertical integration strategy where we could build essential elements of a spacecraft for our own satellites and those built by others. The idea behind this was everything going to space should have a Rocket Lab logo on it!   
**Speaking of…  NASA Psyche Mission**    
NASA’s Psyche mission, which will orbit a metal-rich asteroid of the same name in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is scheduled to launch in less than 30 days on 5 October 2023!    
The spacecraft will use a huge Rocket Lab solar array that will power the spacecraft during its 4-billion-kilometer journey.

**MethaneSAT Mission**  

  
MethaneSAT, scheduled to launch no earlier than January 2024, is an Earth observation satellite that will monitor and study global methane emissions to combat climate change. We are providing multiple elements to make this mission a success including developing the Mission Operation Center, the solar panels to power the spacecraft, and the separation system that will eject the satellite to its orbit. This mission is jointly funded and operated by the Environmental Defense Fund, an American NGO, and the New Zealand Space Agency – the country’s first space science mission!    
**Neutron Update**  
Neutron, our mega constellation launcher, continues its development on schedule. We’ve now begun Stage 2 tank testing including cryogenic fill and pressure cycles to determine structural and sealing integrity and performance, hydrostat test to prove the structural integrity of the structure, domes, and hatches, and the fill, press, vent and de-tank systems and procedures among other structural tests.

I have a question when it comes to investing in stocks that pay out dividends quarterly. 

Do I have to have my money invested in the stock for a certain amount of time before I am eligible to receive dividends?

For example, if the stock is to pay a dividend at the end of December. Will I be eligible to get a dividend if I invest in the stock at the end of November?   
Also, what if I sell my shares after the dividend is paid and buy again the month before the next dividend is to be paid?   
Is that a valid strategy at all?

&lt;p&gt;For example, if the stock is to pay a dividend at the end of December. Will I be eligible to get a dividend if I invest in the stock at the end of November?&lt;br/&gt;
Also, what if I sell my shares after the dividend is paid and buy again the month before the next dividend is to be paid?&lt;br/&gt;
Is that a valid strategy at all? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks &lt;/p&gt;

I’m a 46yo living in Greenville, South Carolina. I’m married with 2 kids still at home (19yo and 14yo) and my 76yo mother who lives with us. 

I make $90k with ~$5k bonus yearly. My 401k is $30k and I very recently moved it all from a 2045 TDF to Fidelity’s Large Cap fund with future contributions going to their S&amp;P Index Fund. I contribute 15% with a 4% company match.

My wife makes $125k with ~$5k bonus yearly. Her 401k has $230k and is in a 2045 TDF. She contributes 15% with a 4% company match. 

My mom gets Medicare at $1.6k per month with a savings of $2000. She was not able to save anything throughout her life (that’s a different story). It’s going to be tough conversations if any big medical bills occur. So far she’s been able to cover her medical expenses. 

We have $16k in traditional savings, and $15k in a taxable brokerage account allocated like so:
VOO - 30%
QQQ - 25%
VUG - 25%
VB - 13.5%
VXUS - 6.5%

We owe $296k on our mortgage at 3.5%. Around $225k equity in the home. We owe $32k at 1.9% on our 2022 Honda Pilot and have a 2019 Honda Civic just paid off. 

We’re in the process of tightening up on frivolous spending and want to put as much money to work for us as hard as it possibly can. I don’t have a final number on what we can invest each month, but it is non-negative, probably $2k/month comfortably.

Firstly apologies, I am very recent into investing so it’s all a bit overwhelming with all the various options for funds to invest in.

I’ve just moved my Lifetime ISA from Moneybox to Trading212, but with further research I’m a bit worried I made a mistake. A lot of the advice I’ve seen for passive investing is to open a Vanguard account, put all my money in a FTSE Global All-Cap and sit on it. Is there an alternative in Trading 212 that I can put my money in and let it sit for 20+ years?

Or would the recommendation be to switch again?

Any help appreciated.

378,investing,"Here is my bullish case for gold:  


**Gold as a Store of Value**  
\- Fiat currency can be printed endlessly, but gold cannot.  
\- The quantity of gold on Earth is limited, and all the gold ever mined would fit into a 20-meter cube.  
\- The purchasing power of a gram of gold is more stable than that of a dollar, which tends to decrease over time.  
\- This means that during periods of high inflation, the price of gold tends to rise, even though it experiences cycles of ups and downs.  


**Gold as a Safe Haven**  
\- Central banks stockpile gold, even though currencies are no longer officially tied to gold, it remains an effective means of building trust in a currency.  
\- When the conflict in Ukraine started, investors rushed to buy gold, causing its price to rise.  
This was not the case for stocks, which plummeted, or for currencies, which also suffered.  
\- Notably, gold has risen during the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the subprime crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic.  
\- It's important to note that gold does not generate income, unlike stocks or real estate investments.  
\- Gold primarily serves as an insurance policy, particularly effective in countries with high political or economic instability (e.g., Turkey, Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina).  


**Gold for Portfolio Diversification**  
\- Gold is also an effective way to diversify a portfolio and decouple it from financial markets. When the stock market declines, the value of gold tends to rise.  
\- Owning gold can be an effective way to shield oneself from market downturns.  
However, it's important to note that gold can also be volatile.  


**How to Invest in Gold**  
\- Buying Physical Gold: The most straightforward method is to purchase gold in the form of bars or coins. Online platforms are often the most convenient option.  
\- Buying Paper Gold: Not my favorite method to invest in gold. You can buy an ETF that tracks the price of gold (e.g., iShares Physical Gold or WisdomTree Physical Gold). Some ETFs invest in baskets of shares of gold mining and exploration companies.

Caravelle International (CACO) is a Singaporean shipping company that is listed on the NASDAQ as a foreign private issuer. That is, they don't have to file quarterly reports nor current reports. They two business segments, namely traditional shipping and a new business segment that's set to take off at the end of 2023 - wood desiccation services.

Fundamentals are good and you're paying almost nothing for it. But that's not what's important. The new wood desiccation segment is built off of an apparently revolutionary technology that reuses the ocean liner's exhaust gases to dry green wood while in voyage. Normally, wood is dried in wood drying kilns on-shore for anywhere between 60-100 dollars per cubic metre and the whole process takes around 45 days. It is expensive, a hassle in terms of logistics, slow and emits a lot of waste gases. This new technology promises to solve all of that and generate additional revenue through the collection of wood vinegar from the drying process, besides requiring only a one-time capex to be fitted onto ships with no additional ship hands needed. It is the only thesis I have for this company.

Here are the big red flags:
1. The documentation for this technology is presented in a doctoral thesis written by Dr Zhang, the CEO and founder of CACO and submitted to Universite Paris-Dauphine in 2018, of which I am unable to verify nor can I verify that Dr Zhang did attain his PhD from said university.

To the wood and shipping experts here: is such a wood desiccation technology even feasible in the first place? I'm sure this idea has been considered before.

2. IR information on their website is completely wrong. The email domain does not exist and the phone number leads to the wrong person. I tried contacting the CEO directly but no news so far.

3. It's registered as an FPI and was formed as a result of a SPAC merger.

4. Next to no information can be found on this company anywhere besides the official website.

Is there something I missed here? Is this company really a scam as I am prepared to believe?

Objective is to day-trade in a tax sheltered account so that there are no consequences while day-trading is conducted within that tax sheltered account.

I checked, IRA, Roth IRA, 401K, it seems that all these have the requirement that any contribution in these have to come from annual income or a portion of it. The issue is there is no income this year or any previous years. Its only my savings I plan on putting in a tax sheltered account.

So with this conundrum, are there any tax sheltered accounts in which I can contribute from savings money and not income money ? Or should I set up a income from day trading / investing first, report it as income and then use that income to put it in tax sheltered accounts ? but then again I won't be able to put anymore than 6500$ of my income into these tax sheltered accounts.

My father, brother and I own a few rental properties between us, but are looking to invest more heavily in additional properties. We would like to form a partnership of sorts where we are all 1/3 owners. We are in the beginning stages of discussion, however, one of us will bring the majority of the funds at first and the other two will manage the properties.

A few questions regarding this approach:

\- Does the main financier need to be the sole person on the LLC?

\- Assuming all of the rent money will need to go back into the main financier's IRA?

\- If this assumption is correct, how do we break the properties out later on? Is this even possible?

Please note, we are planning to buy a few properties at first with the IRA cash and NOT take a profit outside of paying off the main financier with a mortgage ""loan"" amortization type schedule.

The portfolio avoids real estate, financials and consumer discretionary because they are highly correlated with each other, and have been prone to bubble and burst cycles. Their returns are IMO less likely to be drastically improved by technology.

- VGT (technology) is high risk high return
- VDC (staples), VPU (utilities), VHT (healthcare) are more defensive
- VOX (communications) and VIS (industrials) are somewhere in between risk-wise. I still add them because they could be revolutionized further by VR/AR, social media, battery technology, robotics, superconductors, etc.

415,investing,"In an interview on CNBC, investor Warren Buffett said the following: “In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending”. He didn't give the exact reason why this would happen. He just added: “When it happens or how or anything else, I don’t know”. Here we will give the exact reason by demonstrating one fundamental flaw that all cryptocurrencies have.

Cryptocurrencies are publicly portrayed as innovative payment systems. We constantly hear stories about their fancy features like speed, decentralization, security, immutability, and scarcity. And that these features somehow make them better or superior to the fiat payment system. But what we never hear, is that crypto systems cannot solve one fundamental problem. A problem that trumps all those fancy features. Now let's see what exactly that problem is.

In barter or commodity-based payment systems, both parties in an exchange receive either goods or services. If one traded tobacco for a haircut or a cow for gold, both parties received items that satisfy human wants and needs. However, in payment systems like fiat or crypto, there is a problem. Nemaley, only one party receives goods or services. The other party receives just system units. They receive something that cannot be used to satisfy human wants and needs. So obviously, the system that issued such units must be able to solve this problem. The fiat payment system solves it, while crypto does not. Let’s now demonstrate this.

The fiat payment system has two stages. In the first stage, the banks create the units by granting loans or purchasing government bonds. With such created units, loan or bond beneficiaries go to the market and get goods and services. So that stage is when the said problem is created. The market gives up items that can be used to satisfy wants and needs and gets only system units. The solution to this problem comes in the second stage. Namely, given that banks have loan contracts with the beneficiaries, liens on their properties and in the case of government bonds that must be repaid, this forces the beneficiaries to give goods and services back to the market. Otherwise, they would not be able to get the units to pay their debt, and they would face foreclosures on their properties. Additionally, the issued units are  recorded in the balance sheets of the banks as their liabilities. That means that if the beneficiaries default, the banks must sell foreclosed properties for the units to close the unpaid debt and in that way remove liabilities from their balance sheets. And that is how the problem is solved. That is how the market gets goods and services back.

In crypto systems, however, there is no solution to the problem. These systems have only the first stage. The market initially gets the units as trades for electricity needed to maintain the systems. Electricity is a good that can satisfy a lot of needs and wants. But once the market traded that good for the units, and trades them further for other goods and services, these units are never withdrawn from the market. There is no debt-like mechanism with pledged collaterals to ensure regular withdrawal of the units from the market and the return of goods and services. Instead, the market is stuck with the units indefinitely, or at least until the systems collapse.

The creators of crypto systems create them to have all those fancy features that we mentioned at the beginning. From the outside, these features give the appearance of superiority to the fiat payment system. But none of that solves the said problem. In the long run, the market will reject payment systems with such a fundamental flaw. People will stop giving up goods, services, or fiat units that ensure the return of goods and services, for fancy management of units in crypto systems. Nobody can satisfy their wants or needs with decentralization, immutability, or scarcity. But only with goods and services. That is why cryptocurrencies will certainly come to a bad ending.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview on CNBC, investor Warren Buffett said the following: “In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending”.

From the outside, these features give the appearance of superiority to the fiat payment system. But none of that solves the said problem. In the long run, the market will reject payment systems with such a fundamental flaw. People will stop giving up goods, services, or fiat units that ensure the return of goods and services, for fancy management of units in crypto systems. Nobody can satisfy their wants or needs with decentralization, immutability, or scarcity. But only with goods and services. That is why cryptocurrencies will certainly come to a bad ending.&lt;/p&gt;

417,investing,"I've been trying to figure out why anyone just trying to get the best short term safe interest rate on otherwise idle money would invest in T-Bills rather than a money market, today in late 2023.

I have some ideas why but am I missing anything?

1. T-bills at present offer a slightly higher interest rate.
2. T-bills have no expense ratio.  My guess is that is the reason for number 1 above.
3. T-bills rate won't change during the holding period. It's set until maturity. MM fund yields fluctuate.
4. T-bills can be traded.  For a profit sometimes. Or you can hold until maturity.

While Money Market funds have these advantages:

1. MM funds are more liquid.  You can cash out any time instantly. You can even write checks on a Money Market fund.
2. MM Funds could maybe be taxed at a lower rate if held long enouht to be considered long term capital gains.
3. MM Funds don't come with commissions in your brokage account by T-bills might.  I use Fidelity.

Did I miss anything?

My goal is to just make the most interest on money I don't intend to invest in the stock market for 6 months to a year.  So I've been considering T-bills for 6m or maybe 1 year maturity.   But then I look and the MM funds in my sweep or ""core"" accounts and they yield only a little lower.

With T-bills I GUESS it's about locking in a hopefully high rate if you expect interest rates to go down soon.  But right or wrong I don't. Not in the near future anyways.  T-notes or T-Bonds for longer terms I would think would be better for locking in what you THINK are going to be higher rates than possible lower rates a few years out.

This sounds like a no brainer but it is not since most consider current and expected future earnings to be the primary driver. 

For stocks demand is driven by people's need for saving for the future and passive income with their extra savings and short term speculation for price increases. 

Fed can increase the demand on stocks by inflating money supply as they did this during Covid and government can do it by reducing the tax burden on population.

Flair: Rant, but i'll keep it short

All the smart WS money daddies love saying that you should remain within your circle of confidence / competence, look to your own life for investment ideas and such. so I decided to dedicate some of my portfolio to experiment with the idea.

447,investing,"Which do you prefer, and are there any other reliable investment options to grow wealth?

Currently my portfolio is spread somewhat evenly across all 4 of these options.

Here's some random thoughts of mine from my investing journey since 2017.

**REIT**

I really like REITs because of the monthly dividend. There's just something about buying something and having it payout each month that is very desirable to me. Even knowing the returns will never be that of an individual stock win, I just *really* like the concept and consistency of the REIT. I'm tempted to dump 50% of my investments into REIT for this reason alone.

**Stocks**

As the old adage goes; Never buy an asset you don't understand. I figure that you should only buy a stock if you have a good reason, and I don't have much interest researching companies to try and find a good pick, though my mind could be changed on this if someone convinces me it's worth it.

I work in tech so I have a decent understanding of what tech companies do and I've had a few winners that I bought with *some* foresight. I bought AMD at $30 when I saw that Intel was releasing inferior processors at higher cost and trying to prevent hardware reviewers from reviewing them. I bought COIN near its bottom when I saw their stability in the wake of the crypto exchange disasters, and knowing a halving event is on the horizon (verdict is still out on this buy of course). Other stocks like ABBV have done well for me over the years, but I have absolutely no idea why because I know little about the healthcare industry. I lost some money on ABNB, and again I couldn't tell you why because I've never researched this company. I bought the stock a while back because I thought that ABNB would obsolete hotels.

On a long enough timeline, the value of any individual stock will fall to zero. So the question is, when do you sell? Seems to me that playing the individual stock game requires consistent ""maintenance"" and I wonder if it is worth the effort.

Also how much effort is worth spending on statistical analysis like P/E, market cap, volume etc.. ?

**ETF**

Safe and reliable. But it seems like *everyone* is buying these nowadays and recommending that you buy them. I've had VOO and SCHD as my main investments for a while now, and they *seem* to do well. but I can't help but wonder, If you do what everyone else is doing, how could you ever hope to perform above average? Or does it simply come down to the fact that if you are putting more into the market than the average person, you'll come out ahead with an 'average' return?

Is it possible for some kind of ETF apocalypse to happen where the market stagnates due to extreme diversification?

**Robo-investing**

On march of 2022, in the wake of the insane COVID stimulus rally, I came to the conclusion that I had no idea how to understand the market and decided to switch to Betterment. I set the risk to 'max' and started putting 50% of my investment money into Betterment and the remaining 50% into my personal brokerage split between stocks, ETF and REIT. Since then it's gotten me a 5.2% actual return with IRR at 11.2%

This investment vehicle doesn't seem much different that just buying some ETF myself, but maybe there is some happy middle-ground between overly-managed (stocks or human managed funds) and unmanaged (ETF) funds?

A major thorn in my side has been trying to understand foreign stocks vs US. Apparently there is an undulation where the U.S outperforms the rest of the world for several decades, followed by underperformance. I've bought some foreign stock ETFs but these have done poorly next to US companies. Betterment handles this automatically so I figure it's good to get some exposure here.

**Conclusion?**

Aside from derivatives and betting on crypto or individual stocks, the investment world seems like a homogeneous bowl of diversified funds. I'm kind of bored of investing and really just do it because I don't know how else to grow wealth aside from trying to get into real-estate.

I have reached a decent base for myself to build on in the market (around 15k) but now my short-term focus has shifted to rebuilding an emergency fund and cash position in case I should lose my job, go on holiday, move houses, (or another opportunity where I would benefit having easily accessible cash) etc.

I want to have around 12k in high yield savings or cash alternatives. The problem that I've found with myself is that I find it very easy to save money when buying into stocks (I don't want to weaken my portfolio+slightly more barriers to take money out) but as I don't have the best discipline with spending it takes longer for me to save when putting money into a savings account because it is so easy to access on a daily basis.

I am considering putting half of my cash into 4 week T-bills and half into a savings account in order to build my cash position to where I want it to be. Alternatively, I also have considered the option of doing the same with a bond-etf. Bond-etfs and T-bills are attractive to me because I won't be able to access this money as easily on a daily/weekly basis meaning I won't be tempted to spend it on going out vs a savings account. As far as I know I have both these options in either the US or Australian market. 

As I am still learning and I don't know much about bonds/bills, bond-etfs seems like an easy option I could buy right now but I don't know how they compare vs buying T-bills directly. It seems like there is a decent chance of having a negative return with bond-etfs but as I have a short horizon (probably about 12 months) maybe I don't have to worry too much about this.

I inherited a non-spousal traditional IRA from my parent, which is now in a Schwab Inherited IRA. They have the money invested in 14 separate ETF's / Funds. I want to sell it all and then just put all of it in SWVXX. 

I want to do this because I am in my 50's, not experienced or interested in trading at this time, and just want a safer place for the money to live while having liquidity. I do not want to pay an investment advisor to do this. 

The Schwab trade page is intimidating. Is there a simple way to sell everything? When I reviewed an order I was going to place, I selected ""sell all"" (of one fund), and selected ""market"" in the drop down. The current market value is $3,500 but the estimated sale price was only $1,700, so I canceled it. 

I tried this same procedure with another fund. Market value is $35,000 and it would give me about $34,700. These funds are nearly all a little in the red so this made sense, but the first one I tried does not make sense to me. 

Can someone help point me in the right direction to figure out how to *safely* sell all 14 funds so I can turn around and buy SWVXX?

I have recently sold a business and received a 7-figure windfall.  Most money I’ve ever had in my life by a long shot - and I’m trying to quickly educate myself on how to not only keep it but grow it and pass on generational wealth to my young sons.  My strategy is to allocate a roughly 50-50 split between public and private placements.  My public allocations have been deployed into ETFs and I am currently interviewing fund managers to determine the best private allocations.  

But herein lies my question for you investment wizards: should I wait a little longer before pulling the trigger on the private side and locking my money up for a significant amount of time and see what is coming down the pike for the US (and global) economy?  It seems the Oracle of Omaha and others are bearish on the near future of the stock market so wondering if I should wait to potentially buy stocks at a deep discount if the US economy and world economy enter into a deep recession.  

I know trying to time the market is a fool’s game but since I have this large chunk of cash sitting on the sidelines making 5-ish% in a money market, I’m probably as liquid as I’ll ever be so wondering what you guys and gals would do if you were in my shoes.

1. Unable to withdraw from Questwealth portfolio

* There is not easy way to withdraw everything from Questwealth (ie. no ""withdraw all"" button/option)
* They would not let me liquidate all assets in the portfolio and sit as cash, thus you simply have to guess at the portfolio value to withdraw everything
* After initiating a withdrawal and providing my banking details, they could not deposit the funds because I did not provide a void cheque (I have never known any banks to ask for a signed void cheque to DEPOSIT into an account, only for withdrawal)
* This ended up the account liquidating the assets then re-purchasing the shares at a higher price when the deposit did not go through.

1. Instant deposit is not actually instant

* I tried to fund an account via instant deposit. I thought it would be instant (hence the name), but after completing the transfer, it said ""funds are ready to invest after 1-2 days"" and I could not see the balance in the account.
* I then transferred more money using the ""slower"" pre-authorized payment method. They money came in much faster.
* After contacting CS, they said they could not even see the instant deposit transfer and asked for proof of deposit via a receipt. After providing the receipt, they said it would take ANOTHER 2-3 business days.

* All of their CS reps are always nice and all, however, I feel they have no idea what they are doing. They don't seem knowledgeable about the important things.

- emergency fund of 6 months 
- full time job that pays 2k USD after taxes
- 80k in crypto (90% BTC)

&lt;p&gt;Im based in Uruguay, this is an alt account. A lurker of the sub for a while looking for some opinions or points of view that I may skipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past years I started investing on cripto and after two cycles I made a considerable amount of money &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have:
- 2 properties (one rented) with no loans
- emergency fund of 6 months 
- full time job that pays 2k USD after taxes
- 80k in crypto (90% BTC)
- 55k USD cash &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to invest those 55k usd in the SP500 and add $300 monthly, I’m below 30 and in my taxes are included my retirement funds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a good move? I’m missing something? I don’t mind to wait years, I don’t need that money in the near future, I’m not scared of market going down (coming from crypto I lived a -75% twice)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never invested in stocks before, is ok to invest only in Sp500?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!!&lt;/p&gt;

If I buy a share of the sp500 like FXAIX today. And let’s say one of the companies Pat rod the index (ex.

Do I still own the stock of the previous company or by owning the index fund it constantly changes the companies to be up to date?

In other words if I automate my investing and buy shares of this over the timeframe of years. At the end of my investing time, all my shares of this will be different as different companies come and go? Or will the index automatically update with the current listings and market shares?

The biggest offender is Allianz Gilt Yield Fund. I thought I was being wise by diversifying because I read that when stocks go down, gilts and bonds tend to go up. That doesn't seem true. The Alianz Gilt fund, which is apparently mostly UK government bonds, has lost nearly a third of it's value, despite the fact it's supposed to be a lower risk investment vehicle than stocks, it seems to drop when the stock market does, only further, and not recover at all when stocks do. It's not acting like a buffer or hedge at all.

Am I just being short sighted? It's only been three years, after all, but equally, I'm worried this is just going to continue.

In New Zealand, we do not have a capital gains tax, meaning investing within New Zealand doesn't incur tax on gains from selling shares as long as it doesn't fall under being a trader, rather than an investor.

Although there is no capital gains tax here, there are pseudo capital gains tax, and the FIF (Foreign Investment Fund) tax is one of those. It has 2 components: the tax on dividends exceeding 200NZD a year and capital gains off stocks where the investor CONTRIBUTED $50,000NZD in overseas assets. This only includes what the investor puts in, not accounting for increase in stock price.

I am employed by a company that is originally from the US, BUT operating in New Zealand as a New Zealand branch of that company (more accurate an ANZ or Australia/New Zealand branch). They have an ESPP program which allows the purchase of their stocks at a 5% discount, taken from your after-tax pay. Contribution % ranges from 3%-15%, letting you choose anywhere between that.

* BH has over $73 billion in cash reserves.
* It holds stakes in companies like Coca Cola, Bank of America, and notably Apple, of which they own over 5%. It is basically an ETF (without dividends)

  
Warren Buffett is one of the world's best fund managers. He has some basic principles that we should all use:

* Invest only in businesses you understand, with favorable long-term prospects, led by competent management, and at reasonable prices.
* Look for a long-term competitive advantage in a stable industry.
* Seek exceptional companies at reasonable prices, not mediocre companies at bargain prices.  


  
The Risks I see:  


* The company's past performance has been incredible, but its current size will inevitably slow down its performance. 
* Warren Buffet is 93 years old. What is going to happen to BH when he die ? Even that seems ok: It's known that Howard Buffet will be the future Chairman and Greg Abel the future CEO when Warren is no longer around.

Mid 30s, looking to retire when I am due. I actually like my job. Savings totalling 300K. Leaving 100K aside for a near-future house downpayment.

I currently have 200K on 4-mo T-bills until I come up with a proper plan for that money. I see that long-term bonds yields are getting into a sweet spot &gt;4%. One of the possibilities I am contemplating is putting 50% of the capital on 30 yr bonds and the other 50% on VTI/VOO.

Rationale:

* I can probably lock in a 4.3 % yield annually.
* Maturity reached about the time I'll retire
* The bonds generate semiannual interest that I'll reinvest. Either on other bonds or ETFs.
* Assuming the interest can generate 3% interest on average, my 100K principal becomes \~300K by maturity date.
* Why not VOO/VTI and forget about it? Diversification (I plan on putting the other half on stocks). Also, will the mantra ""stock market produce 8% yield on average"" stay true in the future? I don't know, but I am sure the US Gov't will be there
* Inflation! Sure, there'll be inflationary periods, but that should be a fraction on the 30 yr timeline, no?

&lt;p&gt;1 contract, 100 shares of apple - he does not own any shares of apple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avg. price : $62.03&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current price : $74.00&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AAPL currently trading around $189&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strike $195&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exp. Sept. 15&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am assuming that, as he does not own any shares of apple, this is considered a naked call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance for any insight.&lt;/p&gt;

Could someone explain me why is Exxon mobil in the 10th place of the Dow Jones Global index with:

market cap of ~450b

 ~50% of free float

While Eli lilly and company:

market cap of ~500b

~100% of free float

Is outside the top 10? (Factsheet: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/dow-jones-global-index/#overview)

I know the rebalancing of this index is once per year in september and that LLY climb way faster than Exxon this year, however since it is float market cap weighted it should still be before Exxon no?

It also seems like the other global index puts LLY before Exxon so I guess there is an issue.

548,investing,"A buddy of mine just asked me to log into Mint and see how much I have been spending for the year.  The number was pretty shocking especially since it doesn't feel like I live all that extravagantly.   I've always planned to retire at age 45 or 50 or whatever (but I'll truthfully, I'll probably never retire, just start a new business and keep the mind strong) and my goal has always been $~~4~~ 5m in the stock portfolio so I can live on 4% of it which is $200,000 per year.  That seems reasonable, comfortable, and feasible especially if houses are paid off and college tuition is already put aside.

&amp;#x200B;

Well my buddy said, ""no, no, in 10 years your $200,000 spend per year is going to actually become $400,000 because the dollar will be worth way less! You actually need $10m to retire and keep your standard of living the same.""

My thought was, well I'm not saving cash that is weakening and losing to inflation, I'm owning stocks (mostly high growth stocks that trends along the DASDAQ).  Therefore every 10 years my portfolio will double historically if not more (we are currently at 283% on the 10 year coming off a massive low from Nov 2021 factored in).  So yes, my purchasing power might drop in 10 years and I need $400,000 to live the same way as $200,000 buys today but my portfolio will grow to match that if not exceed it especially if I'm only removing 4% each year and not the 6-10% it might grow on average.

What is the consensus here and who is thinking about this the right way?  Obviously being conservative and working harder to get that $10m nest egg is always the smartest option but is my train of thought flawed and I just don't understand something?

I&amp;#39;ve always planned to retire at age 45 or 50 or whatever (but I&amp;#39;ll truthfully, I&amp;#39;ll probably never retire, just start a new business and keep the mind strong) and my goal has always been $&lt;del&gt;4&lt;/del&gt; 5m in the stock portfolio so I can live on 4% of it which is $200,000 per year.  That seems reasonable, comfortable, and feasible especially if houses are paid off and college tuition is already put aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well my buddy said, &amp;quot;no, no, in 10 years your $200,000 spend per year is going to actually become $400,000 because the dollar will be worth way less! You actually need $10m to retire and keep your standard of living the same.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thought was, well I&amp;#39;m not saving cash that is weakening and losing to inflation, I&amp;#39;m owning stocks (mostly high growth stocks that trends along the DASDAQ).  Therefore every 10 years my portfolio will double historically if not more (we are currently at 283% on the 10 year coming off a massive low from Nov 2021 factored in).  So yes, my purchasing power might drop in 10 years and I need $400,000 to live the same way as $200,000 buys today but my portfolio will grow to match that if not exceed it especially if I&amp;#39;m only removing 4% each year and not the 6-10% it might grow on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the consensus here and who is thinking about this the right way?  Obviously being conservative and working harder to get that $10m nest egg is always the smartest option but is my train of thought flawed and I just don&amp;#39;t understand something?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm 28 so retirement is a far off horizon. Already maxing IRA and 401k so I consider my stocks to be more of a ""reserve"" account, ideally for long term growth but also access to additional funds if needed. Biggest fear I guess would be income stays low for a while while I figure things out, market tanks, now I'm selling stocks for pennies on the dollar to get by.

My thoughts/plan:

Sell off DAL, C, NDAQ, TAN, ICLN, &amp; SCHD for a total of $9,153 and net loss of $289. This should cover most of the additional housing expenses and minimize losses.

But what would you do from there, especially if I'm anticipating a big reduction in income for the next 6 months?  Been considering selling everything besides (V)ETFs and then shaving off additional equity as needed but idk if that would be most prudent.

Got the loan as wife doesn&amp;#39;t have full cash on hand and I&amp;#39;d rather have a slow trickle from my account rater than large lump sum payout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got Robinhood in 2020 and quickly realized I have no idea what I&amp;#39;m really doing. Most of my money  is in ETFs but I think there&amp;#39;s a fair amount of redundancy in my holdings and I&amp;#39;d probably benefit from consolidating. Some accounts are positive, some negative. Had to pay taxes last year but don&amp;#39;t really anticipate that being the case for 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 28 so retirement is a far off horizon. Already maxing IRA and 401k so I consider my stocks to be more of a &amp;quot;reserve&amp;quot; account, ideally for long term growth but also access to additional funds if needed. Biggest fear I guess would be income stays low for a while while I figure things out, market tanks, now I&amp;#39;m selling stocks for pennies on the dollar to get by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts/plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sell off DAL, C, NDAQ, TAN, ICLN, &amp;amp; SCHD for a total of $9,153 and net loss of $289. This should cover most of the additional housing expenses and minimize losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what would you do from there, especially if I&amp;#39;m anticipating a big reduction in income for the next 6 months?  Been considering selling everything besides (V)ETFs and then shaving off additional equity as needed but idk if that would be most prudent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance. Didn&amp;#39;t mean for this to turn into a text wall.&lt;/p&gt;

For those not in the know TSM fabs like 50% of apple chips, all NVDA chips. They are the most sophisticated chip fabrication plant on the globe. 

TSM is hanging right around the bottom of the channel of the uptrend. 

now this is a solid company, solid financials, 2% annual dividend, diversifying into arizona (with struggles) and germany (with both comes a lesser ability to produce chips than the main Taiwan factory), which removes **some** of the risk of being solely in Taiwan. Maybe a japan factory as well?

If you bought around 93-92 dollars, set a stop loss at say 87 or 86 being a significant break in trend, or maybe even as low as 84 or 83, a real break in the trend, you would lose somewhere between 6.5% to 10%. 

now if TSM continues the uptrend and we go to 100 you are up 7.5%

if we go to 105 youre up 12.9%

if TSM suprasses a high on its trip down in 2022 around 109 to hit 110, you're up 18.2%

and it just continues up from there, i mean you hit 115 and the risk reward is totally worth it. So you're a long term holder buying into the bottom of the uptrend and setting a stop loss around 88-87, 5-6% risk to make maybe 20% on the high upside, maybe 12.9-7.5 on the lowside. 

its a decent bet.

A bit of background: I'm 27 years old, living in one of the European countries, and I've been involved in stock market investments for more than 3 years now. I started with stock picking, and it just so happened that during the COVID crisis in 2020, I bought quite a few stocks (most of them are from S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats) and other wide ETFs during the downturn. I continued to delve into the topic of investments, studied literature and some stuff, and realized that the stock-picking is not that I want to solely follow. The strategy that suits me is just a long-term investment in the broad market (FTSE All-World / MSCI World) to secure a stable passive income by the age of 45-50 and have a comfortable retirement. I've come to the conclusion that in my case, Irish accumulating ETFs are the most advantageous way, allowing me to defer tax payment until withdrawing the money and not pay taxes upon dividend receipt.  


The question here is that intellectually, I understand that it's more profitable for me to invest in Irish ETFs that accumulate dividends and don't pay them directly into my account but reinvest them in buying more stocks. However, I enjoy the fact of receiving dividends in my account, right when they come in and I get notifications, seeing the statistics. It seems to give me a certain sense of confidence, and it's just nice to see those income streams.  


Since I was about 19, I've enjoyed playing incremental, accumulating games (like idle/clickers) where I can see the results of my actions and how some characteristic accumulates. I mean, I liked compound interest in games, particularly the behavior of ""invested - received more soon.""

Take for example [Fidelity SPAXX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/performance-and-risk/31617H102?type=sq-NavBar). You can see a lot of yield info **relative to today**:

* 7-day yield 4.98%
* 1 year return 4.05%
* 3 year return 1.45%
* etc.

But what I can NOT find are the yields stated in an absolute way that's not relative to today. For example:

* 7-day yield as of 9/1/23
* 7-day yield as of 8/1/23
* 7-day yield as of 7/1/23
* 7-day yield as of 6/1/23

One can find graphs of stock prices **over time** all over the net. But I'm just now realizing you can't find yield prices over time hardly anywhere. (You can find it for really big things like U.S. Govt historical dividend yields. But not individual investments.)

I bought a large chunk of shares a year ago, after the war broke out, as I anticipated the business would survive. Actually, the business is quite well, all things considered.

The issue is with current majority holder, oligarch Verevsky and his fund Namsen. His goal is to take advantage of the war prices and gather full ownership of the company.

He, alongside with the board of directors, initiated a process of delisting from stock exchange. That made many investors selling as most doesn't want to stay with the illiquid shares. He made a call to buy shares for a very low price - 18.5 PLN, what made his engagement up from 37% to 76%.

Nevertheless, he needs over 90% to make mandatory squeeze-out. Last Friday, the company announced that 216 mln new shares were created and the auction was offered to just pre-selected number of participants. Currently, only 84 mln shares were present.

The new shares were sold for 1.15 PLN, while the ordinary shares closing price was 11 PLN!

607,investing,"Dear fellow investors, and fellow participants,

I'd like to share some insights into my investment journey. In January 2022, I embarked on my investment voyage, adopting a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) approach with monthly contributions into IWDA. In February, I deviated slightly from this pattern, making a lump sum investment equivalent to five months' worth of contributions, but then resumed the regular DCA strategy. Throughout this journey, I've maintained a long-term perspective and remained unfazed by temporary losses or seeing my portfolio in the red.

In 2023, I decided to diversify my holdings further by investing in four individual stocks, allocating funds equivalent to three months' worth of expenses to each. I successfully executed this strategy, and at present, I've deployed roughly one-third of my capital, while two-thirds remain in cash.

However, the cash portion of my portfolio is currently parked in a savings account. Regrettably, in the world of Europoor banking. While this cash provides a sense of security, it's not doing much in terms of growing my wealth.

**The rationale behind maintaining a significant cash position is tied to my mortgage, which is due for a rate adjustment in approximately three years and a few months. Currently, I enjoy a favorable interest rate of just 1.7%. While I'm prepared for the possibility of higher rates, I prefer to have a cushion of funds readily available to handle any potential increases. This financial safety net, which comprises the two-thirds of my cash holdings, serves as a precautionary measure to ensure I can comfortably address any future rate adjustments.**

**Of course, I'll continue to generate income, save, and invest during this period, further bolstering my financial position. Consequently, my query is twofold: Where should I consider placing this (for me substantial) cash reserve, and should I be open to slightly more aggressive investment options given my longer time horizon, recognizing that I won't require these funds in the immediate three-year window?**

Your insights and advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

625,investing,"A  big challenge with long-term buy-and-hold in index funds is that many people have trouble sticking with the strategy through bad times - even though they know they should stick to it - and sell.  

Here is what I have found works for me as a psychological trick:  I track my portfolios in Mint, but do so manually (no auto-updates).  I track them as an ""asset"" or ""cash"" with a fixed number I manually input.  So the number only changes when I change the number.  And my rule is that those numbers only ever stay the same or go up (as a portfolio increases), never down (in bad times), because I am not going to realize losses and will eventually recover over the decades.  The losses aren't real because they aren't realized.  I have found this makes it much easier to ignore losses - because Mint tells me that if I don't sell, I'll return to a given number XXXXX if I just stick it out and wait to bounce back.

Example:  Portfolio of index funds starts valued at $100,000.  Market downturn takes its value down to $75,000, but I keep it set at $100,000 in Mint.  Market eventually recovers to $105,000, and I add that value into Mint at that time.

Note that this approach DOES still punish you a bit during a downturn:  Let's suppose that during the downturn to $75,000, I deposit $5,000 a month from my checking account into my index fund portfolio.  That money effectively ""disappears"" from Mint, because it decreases the value of my checking account and does not increase the value of my portfolio in Mint.  (It just increases the holdings in my real portfolio, which remain below the $100,000 value in Mint.)   

In some ways, this is like a poor-man's version of a hedge fund:  It doesn't actually hedge market risk (a real hedge [usually](https://youtube.com/watch?v=DZ2QZg_1pHQ&amp;t=387s&amp;ab_channel=HowMoneyWorks) costs you returns), but it psychologically makes you feel like you are hedged against market risk and makes it less psychologically painful to buy-and-hold through a downturn, because the set $100,000 is basically a representation of your anticipated recovery if you hold.

 Another benefit is that it makes you feel like you are making ""progress"" toward your financial goals:  Even if my portfolio is down over an entire year, if I am gaining a bit in cash, or real estate, or whatever else in Mint, it reflects my net worth increasing over time, which provides another big psychological boost.

In short, this is just a psychological strategy, not an investment strategy.  But if it makes it psychologically easier for some people to actually execute on their intended investment strategy of long-term buy-and-hold in index funds, it could provide better returns.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A  big challenge with long-term buy-and-hold in index funds is that many people have trouble sticking with the strategy through bad times - even though they know they should stick to it - and sell.  &lt;/p&gt;

I have a good amount of money currently in savings and now I realize I’d rather invest it than holding it in a savings account(for obvious reasons). I already have money invested into multiple ETFs ie VOO and other Vanguard ETFs. However recently I realized that dividend ETFs could have some merit due to having such high dividends.

So my question is, what are the merits of either? I’m young and therefore reap the benefits of compound investment, but I also could use a stable income stream to supplement what I have today. I’m leaning towards VOO purely because it has a 1.5% dividend + having the 8% (nowadays it seems like more) inflation adjusted gains. Thoughts?

I'm looking at rearranging my dividend portfolio. I'm in the UK so use Trading 212 and have been putting money into an ""almost daily dividends"" portfolio.

The exchange ratio implies consideration of approximately $0.10 per Small Pharma Share based on the closing price of the Cybin Shares on the Cboe Canada exchange (&amp;quot;Cboe Canada&amp;quot;) on August 25, 2023, representing a 43.6% premium based on the 30-day volume weighted average prices of the Cybin Shares on the Cboe Canada and the Small Pharma Shares on the TSX Venture Exchange (&amp;quot;TSXV&amp;quot;) for the period ended on August 25, 2023. When the Transaction is complete, it is expected that existing Cybin shareholders and Small Pharma securityholders will own approximately 74.5% and 25.5% of Cybin, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

1) One if on Fidelity from a previous employer. This account has about 3k in a target date for for 2065 (LIWKX) that has 60% allocated to domestic stock and 36% allocated to foreign stock. When I go to ""Accounts and Trade"" tab =&gt; select my retirement account =&gt; then click ""View Balances"" I see my current balance along side my rate of return (11.5%) and other info on fees, starting balance for the year, change in market value, etc. What has me confused is I have paid $40 in fees. Looking at the expense ration for LIWKX it says its at .050% so $40 seems like a lot. 

Going to the ""Activity and Orders"" tab I see three categories occuring over and over again ""ADVISOR / CONSULTANT FEE"", ""Realized Gain/Loss"", and ""RECORDKEEPING FEE"". Is there anything I could do to minimize the fees?

&amp;#x200B;

2) The second 401k that is currently active has about 20k with $30 in fees the period of a year, which still seems kinda high? This is all invested in Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Fund (VTTSX) which has a .08% expense ratio. This one has a personal rate of return of 15.27%. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started looking more into asset allocation and want to open up a ROTH IRA in fidelity in either 1) A Target Date fund for 2065 OR 2) Invest 60% into FSKAX and 40% to FTIHX (I would imagine going this route would also minimize fees?).

710,investing,"A debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan is a loan that is made to a company that is in bankruptcy. The loan is used to provide the company with the money it needs to continue operating during the bankruptcy process.

In recent years, DIP loans have become increasingly complex. They are often tied to other transactions, such as rights offerings and backstop fees. This can give the DIP lender significant control over the reorganization plan process.

The research paper ""Standardizing and Unbundling the Sub Rosa DIP Loan"" by Kenneth Ayotte of UC Berkeley School of Law examines the problem of sub rosa DIP loans. A sub rosa DIP loan is a DIP loan that is used to effectively predetermine the terms of the reorganization plan.

The paper argues that sub rosa DIP loans can harm the interests of other creditors. It proposes two solutions to the problem:

1. Standardizing the terms of DIP loans. This would make it more difficult for DIP lenders to use their control over the loan to extract favorable terms in the reorganization plan.

2. Unbundling the terms of DIP loans. This would separate the loan from other transactions, such as rights offerings and backstop fees. This would make it easier for other creditors to assess the value of the loan and to negotiate with the DIP lender.

Constellation Software, Inc. &gt; &gt; CONSTELLATION SOFTWARE INC. DECLARES DIVIDEND AND FILES FINAL PROSPECTUS IN RELATION TO PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED RIGHTS OFFERING OF SERIES 1 DEBENTURES  
Toronto, Ontario – August 23, 2023 – Constellation Software Inc. (TSX: CSU) (the “Company”)  
announced today that it has declared a special dividend (the “Rights Dividend”) pursuant to which  
all common shareholders (the “Shareholders”) of record as of the close of business on September 1,  
2023 (the “Record Date”) will be entitled to receive, by way of a dividend-in-kind, one right of the  
Company (each, a “Right”) for each common share of the Company (the “Common Shares”) held.  
This dividend has been designated as an eligible dividend for purposes of the Income Tax Act  
(Canada) and any similar provincial and territorial legislation.  
The Company also announced that it hasfiled a final short form prospectus (the “Final Prospectus”)  
in relation to its previously announced rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) pursuant to which the  
Company will issue the Rights in satisfaction of the Rights Dividend that will entitle the  
Shareholders to purchase up to C$700 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured subordinated  
floating rate debentures, Series 1 of the Company (the “Series 1 Debentures”).  
The Series 1 Debentures will be issued as an additional tranche of, and will form a single series with,  
the outstanding C$282.2 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured subordinated floating rate  
debentures, Series 1 of the Company. There is no minimum principal amount of Debentures that  
must be issuable upon the exercise of Rights.  
The net proceeds of the Rights Offering are expected to be used by the Company to pay down  
indebtedness under its existing credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), with any remaining proceeds  
to be used for future acquisitions.  
The Rights will be issued in satisfaction of the Rights Dividend in the amount of one Right per  
Common Share. For every 3.03 Rights held, the holder of such Rights will be entitled to subscribe  
for C$100 principal amount of Series 1 Debentures. The Rights and the Series 1 Debentures will be  
qualified for distribution in each province and territory of Canada by way of the Final Prospectus  
and the Debentures have been registered in the United States on Form F-7 under the United States  
Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  
The Series 1 Debentures are expected to be issued on October 6, 2023 (the “Issue Date”) and will  
have the same terms and conditions as the currently outstanding unsecured subordinated floating rate  
debentures, Series 1 of the Company.  
The Series 1 Debentures have a maturity date of March 31, 2040 (the “Maturity Date”). The Series  
1 Debentures will be issuable only in denominations of C$100 and integral multiples thereof and,  
from and including the Issue Date to but excluding March 31, 2024, will bear interest at a rate of  
13.3% per annum (the “Current Rate”). From and including March 31, 2024 to but excluding the  
Maturity Date, the interest rate applicable to the Series 1 Debentures will be reset on an annual basis  
on March 31 of each year, at a rate equal to the annual average percentage change in the All-items  
Consumer Price Index during the 12 month period ending on December 31 in the prior year (which  
amount may be positive or negative) plus 6.5% (the “Floating Interest Rate”). Notwithstanding the  
foregoing, the interest rate applicable to the Series 1 Debentures will not be less than 0%. Interest, if  
any, will be payable quarterly in arrears in equal instalments on March 31, June 30, September 30  
and December 31 in each year. The Current Rate will only apply to the Series 1 Debentures in  
respect of the interest payments up to and including March 31, 2024. Effective March 31, 2024, the  
interest rate payable on the Series 1 Debentures will be based on the applicable Floating Interest  
Rate.  
All payments in respect of the Series 1 Debentures will be subordinated in right of payment to the  
prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the Company, which includes the Credit Facility.  
The Rights will be exercisable until 4:30 p.m. (Toronto time) (the “Expiry Time”) on September 29,  
2023 (the “Expiry Date”) at a price of C$133 per C$100 principal amount of Series 1 Debentures  
purchased, plus accrued interest in the amount of C$0.217 per C$100 principal amount of Series 1  
Debentures purchased on account of interest accrued on the Series 1 Debentures from, and including,  
September 30, 2023 to, but excluding the Issue Date. Rights not fully exercised prior to the Expiry  
Time on the Expiry Date will be void and of no further value.  
The Rights will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) under the symbol “CSU.RT”  
and will be posted for trading on the TSX until 12:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the Expiry Date, at  
which time they will be halted from trading. The TSX has approved the listing of the Rights and the  
Series 1 Debentures, subject to the Company fulfilling all of the requirements of the TSX.  
A copy of the Final Prospectus and, in the case of eligible Shareholders, statements issued under the  
Computershare Direct Registration System, accompanied by rights subscription forms representing  
the Rights to which they are entitled, will be mailed to registered Shareholders following the Record  
Date. Registered Shareholders wishing to exercise their Rights must forward the completed rights  
subscription forms along with the applicable subscription proceeds to Computershare Trust  
Company of Canada by no later than the Expiry Time. Shareholders who hold their Common Shares  
through an intermediary will receive materials and instructions from their intermediary.  
Further details regarding the Rights Offering and the Series 1 Debentures can be found in the Final  
Prospectus which has been filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov,  
and is available on the Company’s website at https://www.csisoftware.com/category/stat-filings.

I was thinking I would split my portfolio something like this:

10% India

My strategy is as following: 
I realise it’s a lot of western world, first-world countries, especially USA. But in my mind I should stick to politically and militarily stable nations with low levels of corruption and bureaucracy. This basically excludes all of Africa, Middle east (except Israel) and most of Asia. 

What I know of my own home EU, is that it’s a heavily taxed and bureaucratic mess and it’s share of total world-wealth has been shrinking while USA’s has stayed the same. On top of that it’s old money, old companies, old nations with workers who rather strikes than innovates. It’s hard doing business and starting new companies, e.g in Sweden it’s almost impossible firing people even if they are jot qualified for what you now need them to do. 

USA is an economical Juggernaut with low level of burocracy. They rule the world. They are not threatened militarily, politically or economically by anyone anymore. China is definitely on the decline so in the end it turned out no one could challenge Pax-Americana after all. The only real threat against USA today is internal polarisation.

I understand how the ‘power law’ reduces idiosyncratic risk, but some prestigious, titans of VC/SV have been very keen to raise industry-specific funds over the past few years in the hopes of catching fledgling industries, which obviously concentrates sector-specific risk.

I think often about a16z and how they have 4 separate funds that are each dedicated to crypto. The size of these funds are quite significant, with the latest crypto-only fund (raised in 2022) having an initial raise/starting capital of $4.5B. In aggregate, around 22% of a16z’s AUM is currently in crypto-only funds. I can’t help but feel that when the entire crypto-ponzi collapses, this could mark the death of a16z after LPs in these funds make near 100% losses on the crypto-focussed funds. I assume other notable VC houses like Sequoia will take a big hit, although a16z is by far the largest VC to have shovelled a substantial amount of its AUM into a giant ponzi, as far as I can make out.

I note that a16z’s ‘best bets’, namely Coinbase and AirBnB, have both slumped post-IPO, with returns of -79% and -30% over their public equity lives (so far), and so a16z may have a much harder time pulling off eye-watering valuations for their next round of IPOs, crypto or otherwise.

It seems like the market sentiment up until a couple weeks ago was that inflation would continue to moderate at a consistent pace, causing interest rates to plateau, and allowing stocks to be favorable.

In my opinion, the chances of inflation moderating at a consistent pace are low. If oil prices spike than wouldn't that cause a ripple effect of interested rates either climbing or staying at the current levels for longer? If that is the case, I would imagine there would be a slow bleed to stocks, especially the cash flow negative ones. 

There's always the chance of an unknown-unknown, Black-Swan event but what would be the most likely knowns to be the catalyst for a sell off? More banks using the repo market and failing? Credit default from commercial real estate or consumers?

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also considering factor investing as a diversification to market cap weighted risk, if anyone has any thoughts on that.&lt;/p&gt;

I can see an argument for either as the EW is obviously less concentrated but still has the advantage of being passively managed.

It looks like there isn't a clear winner in terms of historical performance.  However, these research papers say that non-FMC weighted funds are superior.  (FMC = floating market cap)

I've read that yield producing bonds are better held in 401K accounts.  But i've also read that equities - if you don't need the money short term - should be held in 401K accounts.  In my case, i'd feel better having some bond income I can rely on.

So lets say my target stock/bond allocation is 67/33, and I have 3MM equally distributed across 2 401K's and 1 taxable account.  Which is the better allocation...

OPTION 1:  401K (A) = 100% equities |  401K (B) = 100% equities | TAXABLE = 100% fixed income

OPTION 2:  401K (A) = 67/33  |  401K (B) = 67/33 | TAXABLE = 67/33

I like option 2 because it's much easier to rebalance (as each account is compartmentalized).  I don't like option 2 because bond yield is less, and it's less tax efficient.

VNQ - 4%

Portfolio 2:

VOO 48%

VT 48%

VNQ - 4%

I'm also wondering if I should drop the 4% VNQ or not or if I should add BND.I have 20-30 years to retirement and my risk tolerance is high.So the 2 main differences in these are the international equity exposure.

One method uses VT and the international exposure will fluctuate with the market. The other uses VTI and VXUS to control the international exposure at a fixed 20% (Jack Bogle's advice to never go over 20% into international).

I also added 50% to of the equity portion VOO because it seems that both Jack Boggle and Warren Buffet like the S&amp;P 500. This will make it heavyweight in the S&amp;P 500.

Overall, I can't decide who's right. Some people like just one of the core Equity ETFs I used (VT, VTI or VOO) and I tried to split the difference.

I added VNQ at 4% for diversity. I'm wondering if I should add BND, but the returns are just soo bad.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any critical feedback is greatly appreciated. These are 2 passive portfolios that i don&amp;#39;t want to touch for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

Situation - married with 1 child, M29, F33

We recently married and after this now have around 80k EUR to use for property in some way. Around 40k in investment accounts for retirement, currently put away 850 a month for that.

Currently living in a nice 2 bed apartment 800 euros per month. The rent is about 15% of our household income combined.

We plan to deploy around 70k in a 3 bed airbnb in Vienna. Flat price around 350k. Projected yearly income from this would be 30k, minus 16k mortgage and tax on profits and other costs its around 8k take home per year.

We then want to get a 2nd investment property as soon as possible via job savings, equity and airbnb income.

All while renting cheap as its flexible and offers flexibility with my job moving me around which can happen.

Is this a good strategy? Is it okay to rent reasonably while investing in rental properties in this way? We would want to get a family home in the long term but not in the next 3-5 years.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a thoughtful question to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

Disclaimer: I am an european based investor so I am using ETFs available in EU and fiscally optimized, so you could see unfamiliar tickers but please take in consideration the tracked indexes.

Parameters

1. After some research on Fama/French Factors I want to introduce the factor of Value and Quality into the Developed market stock ETFs tracking **MSCI World Sector Neutral Quality Index** and **MSCI World Enhanced Value Index** (if you know better index to use please let me know, these are the ones I found that I can invest -VTV for example is unavailable in EU- but would like to see alternatives). Equal weight between the 2
2. Introduce a size factor with Small Caps but with focus on Value since this is the portion of the SC that gives better returns. The only option here for me is mixing **MSCI US Small Cap Value** and **MSCI EU Small Cap Value**, unluckily I don't have options for World Small Cap Value in EU. Here I would overweight US Small Cap to sort of recreate a total market cap weight.
3. After long thoughts I decided to exclude Emerging Markets from the portfolio, since I am reading a lot on it and I am starting to get convinced that the risk/return is not so appealing due to more uncertainty of the political and financial landscape of these countries.

I have done different backtests and the results are interesting. First of all I noticed that there was a quite strong volatility and playing around with different hedges I have seen that a 10% Gold reduces yearly return of less than 0.1% on 25 years period but mitigates significantly the volatility. I am not a fan of Gold but I added into the test portfolio that is now as following

&amp;#x200B;

* **35% MSCI World Sector Neutral Quality Index ETF (XDEV)**
* **35% MSCI World Enhanced Value Index ETF (XDEQ)**
* **12.5% MSCI US Small Cap Value ETF (ZPRV)**
* **7,5% MSCI EU Small Cap Value ETF (ZPRX)**
* **10% Gold ETF (SGLD)**

I have then backtested it against SP500 (last 25 years)

and world total stock (VWCE last 20 years)

[https://imgur.com/bPjYAi7](https://imgur.com/bPjYAi7)

I tried do backtest for a longer period but cant find a tool to do it. If anyone has a way to do that would be fantastic.

As you see the portfolio performed significantly better in terms of total returns. On yearly returns it was almost 1% better than SP500 and 1,5% of Total World. 

Also I have calculated some indicators (at today)

Market cap = shares outstanding \* stock price

Say, for example, AMC does a 10:1 reverse stock split so shares outstanding goes from 58,000,000 to 550,000,000.

The stock price obviously increases as well. Well if stock price and shares outstanding increases why wouldn't this increase market cap?

Chatgpt says this is understandably wrong and Reverse splits involve shares outstanding decreasing. Well, this is confusing to me too. If shares outstanding decreases then why did AMC's increase?

&lt;p&gt;For example, I saw in the high yield section &amp;quot;GS Corp 4.4&amp;quot; which I assume is goldman sachs with an ask yield of 14.9% (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Cm7tYrK""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/Cm7tYrK&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is the yield so high? I don&amp;#39;t think goldman will go bankrupt anytime soon and neither does anybody else I assume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does it not have an expiration date?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it has no expiration, when will the price come back to 100 as we approach maturity?
It says &amp;quot;Next coupon payment date Feb 10, 2024&amp;quot; why is it so long?

""Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday called for more vigilance in the fight against inflation, warning that additional interest rate increases could be yet to come.

While acknowledging that progress has been made, the central bank leader said inflation is still above where policymakers feel comfortable. ""

Having listened to Powell's speech, he mainly pointed out that core PCE inflation is still too high at 4.1%. While headline inflation is lower right now at 3%, as soon as energy (or food) prices would go higher again, something you can expect going into winter, also headline inflation will go higher again if core inflation doesn't push back against it.

**So expect more hikes. Energy prices will move higher towards winter and if core doesn't come down drastically, overall inflation will stay high or move even higher. That's what Powell was basically referring to. His preferred indicator is core PCE minus housing.**

**Note:** Fed's own Nowcasting shows **PCE for August at +0,6%**, way above the number for July even when adding some room for error with their forecast.

How does one calculate a total projected portfolio growth when dollar cost averaging? I don't even know if that's phrased well enough, so I'll try to explain what I mean.  
  
The SP500 has a growth of \~51% over the last 5 years, which is an average return of \~8.59% annually.  
  
If one is to dollar cost average, say yearly of the same amount and a ""fixed"" 8.59% annual return for simplicity, the growths at the end of the 5th year: the initial investment made at the start of year 1 is +51%, the 2nd year investment is +39%, the 3rd year investment is +28%, the 4th year investment is 17.9%, the 5th year investment is +8.6%.  
  
The total portfolio growth at the end of the 5th year is therefore \~+28.9%.  
  
If one makes a 6th year contribution, which has 0% growth, the portfolio growth drops to 24%. But by the end of the 6th year it's up to 33%.  
  
Is there a way to calculate that growth number with inputs for years of investing, DCA amount, DCA frequency, average annual rate of return?  
  
I guess even more importantly, is this metric even important? I don't really see ""total growth"" represented and the focus is always that annualized average growth. I'm just curious after say 30 or 40 years of investing, what's the total gain on the portfolio? One would constantly be averaging in that 0% at their latest DCA contribution, but the older investments would (hopefully) have a very high return while newer investments are still low just based on time spent in the market.  
  
Obviously it's understood some percentages are higher, some are lower or even negative, and the annualized average is historically near that 8% (call it 6-10%ish).

&lt;li&gt;Rental properties - I can’t find any deals where at best I’m breaking even. Cap rate above 5% but ROI is still less than 4%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commercial Properties- maybe it’s where I live but it seems like these are such a loss and only for people who are going to buy and then operate a business inside. Unless you go huge and have over 5mm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construction - the cost to build per square foot is higher than the price to sell. So this is out. I have land for this and it’s not worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Businesses- Honestly this would be great but there’s no such thing as an absentee owner and bizbuysell is full of junk and everyone wants the bag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SaaS and E-Com - takes a ton of capital and seems over saturated (I work in this field and have lost on it already). Currently selling on MicroAcquire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leave Bonds, Index Funds, HYSA, and starting a company from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone out there making moves? I would love a mentor who is successful in one of these. I’m a WFH engineer wanting to branch out.&lt;/p&gt;

802,investing,"Hi all, I've been brushing up with this forum and some of the recommended books and finally decided to jump ship from Northwestern Mutual and do my own thing in Schwab. Problem is, the holdings they were using are ""institution customers only"" funds that are kind of built for wealth managers to tool around with (and get paid a lil extra too). So that means they have huge expense ratios and I think some other stuff I don't understand... Stuff that makes them not really the best option for a personal investor to have.

They are Russell Tax Managed funds with expense ratios around 0.9-1.0%. It's a basic mix of bonds and stocks, only about 7 holdings total. Unfortunately one of them was *never* sold since 2017, so it has a huge capital gain. I don't know how to get rid of it at this point without incurring a ton of taxes.

I think I can manage some of the other holdings, a couple of them are a net loss, even after 8 years somehow... so I think I could offset that by selling one with an equal net gain.

But yeah, it's a process I think, and I'm on the fence about doing it at all. I don't know if it's worth it to mess around with it at this point, aside from just rebalancing every so often.

Anyway, any thoughts are appreciated thank you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I&amp;#39;ve been brushing up with this forum and some of the recommended books and finally decided to jump ship from Northwestern Mutual and do my own thing in Schwab.

It would be a bit of a hassle to unblock it when I do want to trade because it would have to go to their fraud department for clearance since they will need to verify my identity but would give me peace of mind.

Does anyone have any experience with setting up such a thing at your brokerage and did you face any unforeseen issues? Anything I should be aware of if I choose to enable it (other than delays to trading)?

Over the past, I developed this habit of selling ETFs like QQQ/SMH and buying them back. This way, I secured my money (no loss) since 2021 December but a little gain appx 5% or less.

Even though I spot deep low good spot, I buy them some 10% or 20% of cash and sell them early to book profit, never had a guts to hold it.

Most of the times, I am missing the boat, continuous growth. I still feel bearish and trading then and there.

I recently tried bonds like TLT, but it went down from $98 to $95 range, sold it. I recently bought  APLY (thinking low volatility) around $19.5 but sold today by fear of losing money. When I buy, I think of hold long, but when I see nice jump or profit, my fear increases, selling it.

In my past, I bought TSLA at $41, NVDA at $55, FB at $50 and GOOGL $120. Had I kept those, I would have been multi millionaire by now, but sold everything with trading mindset.

Many of my friends told me, even close friend holding AAPL since 1998,  that trading not good, and try to make investing habits, but still my mind does not accept seeing huge negative on my account, say loss $10000.

I am mid 50s and naturally fear of losing money is common, but is trapped by trading mindset which I want to get rid of.

Read many books like Intelligent investor, Margin of safety etc and also reading many books, but that does not remove my fear of losing money.

Secondly, I had a small non-active rollover IRA that I just reactivated, maxed out and invested in broad market funds through fidelity.

I’ve also just set up two 529s for my kids that I put money in each month. 

So, here I am with only a small pension and an underfunded (newly) maxed out RolloverIRA. So now I’m looking for additional options to supplement my retirement to make up for the lost time. I talked with a fidelity advisor and he pointed out that I really don’t have many options. Because I’m considered a “high income earner” (even though living in this city + childcare bleeds me dry) ..with an over 250k income, I am not allowed to even set up a personal 401k, Roth, SEP IRA, or any other tax advantaged vehicle.

So what then are my options? How does one strategize a retirement when all the tax advantaged vehicles are for &gt;200k income earners?  Am I stuck with just a small pension, social security,  and whatever this Rollover IRA makes over the next 20 years?

852,investing,"We all heard of stock picking's ups and downs. The minority of stocks are the majority of market growth, and if you can find them you can outperform the market. You probably won't, because you're competing with bunches of other people who are smarter than you. Generally people are just taking more risk than they realize.

What about the opposite? Excluding stocks or sectors you consider junk whilst holding the market portfolio otherwise. For instance, if you held every bank stock but Credit Suisse over the past few years, you would have outperformed the sector. If you held every sector but crypto, you would have outperformed the market.

I heard of one study where it was found that small cap value stocks were found to underperform the market. This made no sense to the researchers as these stocks should outperform on average since they are riskier than the market. The study corrected this discrepancy by excluding stocks that met criteria for terminal decline.

The question is can one reasonably expect to identify stocks before or during terminal decline? For instance, with all the regulatory hoopla over digital money, it is likely wise to not own coinbase or the miners because even if they don't go to zero a lot of them will inevitably terminate in liquidation. This is not advising to short, because shorting costs money, but you may capture the upside benefit of their underperformance even if they do not go to zero.

Getting alpha returns is all about risk-reward tradeoffs and I personally don't mind any criticism because I am done with active investing of any kind.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all heard of stock picking&amp;#39;s ups and downs. The minority of stocks are the majority of market growth, and if you can find them you can outperform the market. You probably won&amp;#39;t, because you&amp;#39;re competing with bunches of other people who are smarter than you. Generally people are just taking more risk than they realize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the opposite? Excluding stocks or sectors you consider junk whilst holding the market portfolio otherwise. For instance, if you held every bank stock but Credit Suisse over the past few years, you would have outperformed the sector. If you held every sector but crypto, you would have outperformed the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard of one study where it was found that small cap value stocks were found to underperform the market. This made no sense to the researchers as these stocks should outperform on average since they are riskier than the market. The study corrected this discrepancy by excluding stocks that met criteria for terminal decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is can one reasonably expect to identify stocks before or during terminal decline? For instance, with all the regulatory hoopla over digital money, it is likely wise to not own coinbase or the miners because even if they don&amp;#39;t go to zero a lot of them will inevitably terminate in liquidation. This is not advising to short, because shorting costs money, but you may capture the upside benefit of their underperformance even if they do not go to zero. Likewise, Nikola stock experienced years of slow underperformance following the criminal charges against Trevor Milton, but his employees have used the scraps from that fraud to make a real truck factory.

855,investing,"Hi there!  
  
I started investing more than a year ago. Since then, I have been reading various books and following (IMO) credible people to learn how to evaluate companies for long time investing.  
  
I still have plenty of candidates to screen that I am interested in. However, I get stuck on some now since those are companies that are young (concerning being public). So, I find it hard to make a rational decision if it is worth a buy or not.  
  
Let me explain: I am a molecular biologist and had a job interview with a company that is dealing with synthetic biology (They did not take me but I found a job somewhere else). That topic was highly interesting. I read a bit into it and realized that there is huge growth potential in this industry for the coming years. Now, since I started screening biotech companies for the beginning (since this is something I know stuff about) I sometimes encounter the issue of not being able to evaluate a company based on them being too short on the market (aside from ALL other biotech companies that are overvalued or just hard to evaluate since the Pandemic just boosted all their share prices and revenue into oblivion for 2 year).  
  
Anyway, so I am specifically talking about Twist Bioscience, Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings and Azenta (maybe also Termo Scientific, but they are way too overvalued right now). So, for those companies, I cannot apply any of the standard valuations like calculation its ""fair"" value applying growth estimates through EPS and P/E. Also, discounted cash flow model is a problem since these companies are starting out and their numbers are red. Graham’s formula or the multiple valuation model is also useless since EPS and P/E are basically non-existent.  
  
I am fan of TWST. Have been a customer in the past and now again at my new position. Also, their plans, projects, and visions of TWST and DNA sound very intriguing and the CEOs seem rational, potent, and capable.  
  
I hope you see the dilemma I am in. There are potential candidates that I think have a big growth potential with a big intrinsic value (scientifically and culturally). However, I cannot predict the fair share price value due to limiting available data.  
  
What do you do in this situation? The only thing that seems to look ""good"" are revenue data and equity growth for these companies. Is it valid to just look at these datapoints? Because ROIC, EPS, cash or P/E are non-existing or in minus. Even though for example TWIST is a well-known and reliable company that obviously has a growing revenue steam.  
  
I am happy for any tips and discussions concerning this topic. I do not want your opinion if those companies are a buy or not. I want input concerning the process of making rational discissions based on the limited data available in this case and how to guestimate (?) the potential future of such innovative but young companies.

Don’t dividends and share buybacks indicate that the company has shifted from its Product Life Cycle “Growth” stage to “Maturity” stage? Doesn’t that mean that it isn’t a growth investment anymore?&lt;/p&gt;

868,investing,"Hi, i have some spare money that i want to spend. I have read that a lump sum investment is most of the times better. First i thought to invest it all at once in a S&amp;P ETF. Then i researched that the S&amp;P is a composite index of the 11 sectors in which IT sector is 27% and healthcare is 15% and financial is 10% and energy only 2,5%

So i thought i could shape them on my own predictions.

So my preliminary plan is following:

1000 $ iShares S&amp;P 500 Information technology sector (slight recession fears for Q1/24, still good idea? could also invest more since i expect most growth in IT sector in all the market)

1000$ iShares World Healthcare sector (etf has lost a few %, maybe the dip is there and  new vaccines about to be distributed this fall/winter and also because of demographics i expect growth in this sector)

1000$ iShares S&amp;P 500 Consumer staples (defensive even in recession)

1000$ iShares World Energy sector (i believe that energy prices will still rise and the energy corps. won't invest so much for growth and instead they will rise prises to profit because of climate change )

Because of the recent defaults in the banking sector like SVB i predict no growth rather a downturn in financial sector (10% of the S&amp;P index, might dampen the index). For consumer discretionary i am not sure. It all depends if there will be a slight recession as the current news is indicating or that is already priced in as it alwalys is in the stock market. Also if the interest rate hikes end, more growth for IT sector and probably consumer discretionary could be anticipated. For communications services sector i am not sure.

Feel free to comment on my predictions or on my strategy. Maybe i am delusional and a fool. I simply don't want to wait if the S&amp;P remains sideways for years when in fact some sectors grow and some are in downturn. Because of the broad diversification i fear that i loose potentional gains.

I've been trying to read up more on the various KPIs and ratios one can use to gauge the ""quality"" of a portfolio.  Once of those is the popular Sharpe Ratio designed to evaluate a portfolio’s risk-adjusted performance.  My question is pretty basic, and that is whether it is still fundamentally a value that relies on past performance to project potential future performance?  In other words, if you assemble a set of stocks and backtest them to derive Sharpe ratios, use of that ratio in the future is assuming the future will be similar to the past.

Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

880,investing,"Bonds are historically mediocre at returning positive real yields, which is why I've avoided them.  But it seems to me that using bonds to bet on an interest rate reversion seems promising.

Here are the premises, as I see them:

* 30 year T-bonds are paying [4.45%](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us)

* The Fed is seeking to return to 2% inflation.  During the 2010-2019 pre-covid era, at this inflation level, [30 year bond yields were about 1.5-2%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS30)

* There are good reasons to believe that the current episode of inflation is an economic readjustment from covid era shifts in demand, not a consequence of pre-covid low rates.

* If I use the zero-coupon bond equation value for interest rate r, par value V, years Y: Price=*P=V/(1+r)^Y* I get the following 30 year 3-year-holding period  nominal-dollar profits for holding bonds through an interest rate shift from rate r1 to r2, as *Profit = [(1+r2)^(Y-3)/(1+r1)^(Y)]-1*

    * +116% profit if 30 year bond rates drop to 'normal' level of 2% after 3 years

    * +66% profit if 30 year bond rates drop to 3% after 3 years

    * 1.2% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 5% after 3 years

    * 23.5% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 6% after 3 years

    * 40% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 7% after 3 years

If one is afraid of inflation during the holding period, one could pay a similar game with TIPS, which yield over 2%, but for recent history have tended to [cluster around 1%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII30).   In this case, buying TIPS at 2% and selling in 3 years at a 1% rate would yield a 38% real-dollar profit, or about 11% a year.

Personally, I think that it is far more likely for rates to hold steady or fall back to 2%, because the 2009 to 2020 2% inflation era seemed to work OK economically.

So under this reasoning, the sensible strategy might be to bail  out of stocks, pile into long-term T-bonds, and get back into stocks if and when stock prices (P/E) readjust to more closely reflect the traditional 4% equity risk premium, roughly   P/E=1/(2% real  bond yield + 4% equity risk premium )=17.  Or even if P/E doesn't fall, holding bonds through an interest rate decline would give one a lot more money to put into modestly historically overpriced stocks.
