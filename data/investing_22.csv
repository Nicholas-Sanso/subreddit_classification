My player 2 has VOO in their IRA, plus my work pension is deposited into a MidCap S&amp;amp;P 400 index and SmallCap S&amp;amp;P 600 index. We have roughly 38 individual dividend paying stocks in our IRA&amp;#39;s and a general brokerage account that we add approx. $1025 a month across the lot of them. My player 2 will have a very good pension/paid salary when they retire so my goal is to supplement the difference with dividend income (currently getting 7.2k/yr in dividends) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am 40 so I have roughly a 20 year horizon. I was very interested in VWELX but sadly Fidelity charges a $75 transaction fee for it. I know people seem to be big fans of SCHD but if anyone has any other recommendations or suggestions i&amp;#39;d really love to hear it! &lt;/p&gt;

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2023-11-17.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

Tesla cut the price of some Model 3 and Model Y versions in the U.S. after the company reported third-quarter deliveries that missed market expectations.  
  
The starting price for the Model 3 is listed at $38,990 on Tesla’s website, down from $40,240 previously. The long range Model 3 fell from $47,240 to $45,990. And the Model 3 Performance fell to $50,990 from $53,240.  
  
Tesla’s Model Y Performance sports utility vehicle now starts at $52,490, down from a previous price of $54,490.

Beginning at the end of last year, Tesla began cutting the prices of its cars across the world in a bid to stoke demand amid concerns over slowing consumer spending in markets like the U.S. and China and as competition in the electric vehicle space ramped up.

I&amp;#39;m curious as this really is a high expense ratio and I know I&amp;#39;m paying 2.5% in my fees. I just want to know if I have this correct. Thank you in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

Huge investing firm (let's call them **HIF**; their name appears in this subreddit frequently) ignored a formal written request (via snail-mailed official notarized forms, death certificate, ""letter of intent"", federal EIN number assigned to the estate) from the estate administrator (let's call them **EA**) for a distribution of the entire balance of a deceased employee 401K account, payable to ""The Estate of &lt;deceased full name&gt;"".

Instead, the HIF put all of the money into a different 401K investment account within their company. HIF had no permission from the EA to do this, and HIF did not inform the EA that they had done this.

Prior to sending the forms/docs to HIF, the EA was advised (during a phone call) by an admin person from the HIF *exactly* how to fill out HIF's ""swiss army knife"" of a distribution form in order to receive a check made payable to the estate of the account holder.

During a later conversation with HIF support (trying to figure out what was going on after hearing nothing after submitting the forms/docs), the EA was told that the 401K account for the deceased no longer existed (!). After several conversations with supervisors, it was learned that the entire balance had been placed into different, minty-fresh account named ""The Estate of &lt;deceased full name&gt;"".

The EA was instructed to create an online access via the HIF website, to login and then do ACH transfer (after having to wait 7 days from login creation) from the new investment account to the estate bank account.

Due to technical screwups by HIF in creating the new account, the EA was unable to request/create a login to the website for many weeks.

After lots of effort with tech support, the EA was finally able to login, BUT NOW could not create an entry for a target bank account for the ACH transfer, again due to technical issues occurring within HIF.

Many EA phone calls with HIF tech support, all sorts of things tried, all attempts to create target bank account entry are failing. Error message continues to suggest ""bad data entered"", but this error occurs with data auto-populated from their own database!

All of the above has taken over 3 months, lots of calls to the one-and-only HIF support number for during which time the value of the account has decreased by about 10% due to investment losses in the current stock market.

73,investing,"Long term yields have skyrocketed lately. Why? Several reasons, but most notably is major Central Banks unloading long term treasuries to support their local currency. Look at China and Japan for example. These guys are dumping billions of long term treasuries onto the open market. This creates disequilibrium and forces rates skyward.

Okay, we know this, we see this. But even with this happening, capital should be jumping in and scooping up these bonds without major impact on yields. Well, there is hesitancy. Why?

In the 2010's long term yields regularly hovered around 2-3%, eventually bottoming coming out of COVID due to Fed rate hikes, at roughly 0.6%. 0.6%! Take a minute to process that. People / banks / etc. were happily buying long term US debt and only asking for 0.6% yield.

In hindsight we now see this was incredibly foolish. Anyone who was overweight these bonds is now in a world of trouble. It's the reason we had multiple banking collapses in March. Central Banks are heavily underwater on their long duration assets as well. The market has now realized that long term yields were not properly priced for risk.

This means that for the foreseeable future, long term yields will not come down to anywhere near the levels we saw in the 2010's. There has been so much damage done, the market will demand higher long term yields. Even if the Fed cuts rates and cuts them hard, the market will not be going back to sub 2% yields.

Long term yields have a much higher floor now that we have seen the return of inflation. The damage has been immense to those who gorged on long duration assets pre-2022. The days of low long term yields are behind us. Unsure what that means for the market at large, all I can say is that the bond market has truly taken the message here.

76,investing,"All products traded in the market have two types of demand - real and speculative. The first means that market participants desire products for specific purposes. The second means they desire them to hold and ultimately exchange them on the market. For example. A desire for wheat to make food or gold to make jewelry, electronics, ornaments, etc. is a real demand. If, on the other hand, wheat or gold is desired only to be held and later exchanged, that is speculative demand.

The same is true for financial products. They have both real and speculative demand. When shares are desired for receiving dividends, buybacks or funds from liquidated assets, that is real demand. With bonds, real demand is those who want to receive coupons or face value at maturity. Units of fiat currencies are created with loans from commercial banks and purchases of government bonds by central banks, so the real demand is debtors who need them to repay those loans and bonds. If, on the other hand, stocks, bonds and fiat currencies are desired to be held and ultimately exchanged on the market, that is speculative demand.

So, everything traded on the market has both real and speculative demand. However, in 2009, a precedent occurred. The so-called cryptocurrencies started to appear. They are virtual coins that have only speculative demand. Whoever holds these coins, sooner or later has to exchange them on the market because there is no specific purpose they can use them for.

A situation where something is traded on the market but has no real demand has never been seen in human history. The only reason products are created and brought to the market is real demand that uses them for specific purposes. Speculative demand is only a byproduct of real demand. Speculators on the market make predictions about how valuable products are to real demand and then pay prices according to those predictions. For example. By wheat having a nutritional purpose, speculators approximately know how valuable it is to consumers and whether prices are cheap or expensive. Similarly, by fiat currencies having the purpose of paying debt to the banks and by debtors facing foreclosures in case of default, speculators know these currencies are worth to debtors somewhere in the range of pledged collaterals. Meaning, they will not trade houses for a specific number of currency units if they see that banks take cars as collateral when issuing that number of units.

As crypto virtual coins have no specific purpose and, therefore, no real demand, there is nothing to predict. There's no way to tell whether prices are cheap or expensive. In crypto, speculators pay prices solely in the hope that other speculators will pay them higher prices in the future. Essentially, they believe in the greater fool theory and have hopes of ever-rising speculative demand.

Throughout history, there used to be situations where large ratios of speculative and real demand were created. This caused market bubbles, the most famous of which is the tulip one. But never before has that ratio been infinite, with speculative demand above zero and real demand at zero.

All bubbles eventually but inevitably pop. Then, massive sell-offs cause prices to decline, often quite dramatically. The real demand is what stops prices from further decline. With crypto lacking such demand, there is nothing to stop the decline, and prices inevitably must fall to zero.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;All products traded in the market have two types of demand - real and speculative.

QUESTIONS: Should I be very worried? Is this kind of 'fluctuation' normal? Am I about to lose all my money? What would you do if you were me? 

Note: I have no prior experience with investing and I reside in a foreign country. The IRA is with Schwab which just happened to be who I bank with.

Edit to add: I was under the impression that this type of conservatively funded IRA would gain in value over years. I did not imagine I would lose my inheritance this way, it looks like it's down about $4,000 since it transferred to me.

Given the recent downturn in the bond market, I'm beginning to see potential in long duration bonds as a viable play. It's quite evident that they've taken quite a hit, and my gut feeling is that there might be an opportunity here to capitalize on potential upside.

To exploit this, I'm considering purchasing call options a year out, thus providing some leverage on a potential rally in bond prices without having to directly buy and hold the underlying assets.

However, I'm a bit conflicted on which long term bond ETF to target. There are numerous options, each with their own pros and cons.

Some of the candidates I've looked into:

TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF)
ZROZ (PIMCO 25+ Year Zero Coupon U.S. Treasury Index ETF)
EDV (Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury ETF)
Do any of you have insights or experiences with the above ETFs or perhaps another recommendation that I haven't considered?

Furthermore, if you have dabbled in call options for bond ETFs in the past, any advice on navigating this territory would be immensely appreciated.

98,investing,"All,

I would love to understand a few things about bonds and how stocks move when bond move.

1. Bond yield and broader stock market.

So it's a known fact that as bond yields go up, stock prices fall. Mainly, this is because higher yield mean lower valuations for companies as well as investors seeing more value in bonds that are almost 100% safe. Therefore money moves from stocks to bonds.

However, I don't get how or why this correlation would work in short term. For example, since the 10 year treasury yield is now going up since a week / month, indexes have fallen quite a bit. Would the valuations of companies really change much due to increase in yields in the short term?

Also, if investors are selling stocks and buying bonds to securing higher yields, wouldn't that actually bring the yield down? Why is it still going up?


2. Since the 10 year treasury yield had risen a lot recently, the difference between 10 year and 2 year yield is at a recent low (-0.4). If the yield curve were to reach almost 0 or become positive again, what would it mean for the stock market?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;All,&lt;/p&gt;

105,investing,"I watched Dave Ramsey explain why 401K loans are a bad idea and I understood his point... However, something didn't track with me and I got to thinking - If these are pretax dollars that an account owner has access to then wouldn't funding a 401K in order to take loans for investing opportunities give you extra spending power as well as extra compounding power?

First off, there are limitations on the size of the loan (50% of account value or 50k whichever comes first). Additionally, it has a higher interest rate of typically 1% greater than the prime rate. That said the interest is basically a forced saving rate since the account owner pays themselves back. I personally don't take issue with the fact that 50% is locked up because it remains invested offering a forced hedge. Regarding the interest rate, couldn't the interest paid then be included in the ""20% retirement savings rule"", since it is on top of principal repayment?

After making some conservative assumptions and doing some very rudimentary exel modeling - utilizing a 401k as an opportunity fund appears to make sense against saving/nonq investing after contributing for a couple of years. The drawback is that your loaned funds don't remain invested causing the account owner to miss out on potential gains, but if you were spending money in a nonq account then you're being taxed multiple times over. (While a loan is out the balance is protected from potential downside though and the interest mechanism essentially forces DCA). Account value past 100k is not beneficial to the strategy and could be backdoored each year while tax rates remain low. Again, actual retirement savings are not having their compounding interrupted as they are in different accounts.

113,investing,"From the wsj: https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/rising-rates-likely-hit-bank-balance-sheets-in-quarter-ebad3562

&gt;A surge in interest rates likely worsened unrealized losses on bonds and loans held by U.S. banks in the third quarter, further straining their balance sheets as they face pressure to pay more to keep depositors. 

&gt;Unrealized losses were a key cause of Silicon Valley Bank’s failure in March, which spurred other bank runs. That risk has ebbed. Total deposits at U.S. commercial banks were little-changed since the end of the second quarter, according to the Federal Reserve’s latest data, although they are down 5% since their peak level in April 2022. 

&gt;The higher rates are due to a robust economy, calm in the banking system and, more recently, signals by the Fed that it will likely keep rates higher for longer. 

&gt;That has led to earnings pressure for many banks, now paying higher rates on deposits and other funding sources while the returns on their older, fixed-rate assets stay low. Banks are lending more at the current high rates, potentially easing that strain.

&gt;Importantly, however, the industry has staunched deposit outflows for now. “I expect unrealized losses to increase,” said Alexander Yokum, a banking analyst at the investment-research firm CFRA. “For us, solvency issues are less of a concern, but the amount of profitability is a concern.”

&gt;Yields rose dramatically in the third quarter, especially for long-dated bonds. Yields on 10-year Treasurys rose three-quarters of a percentage point to 4.57%. 

&gt;Higher yields cause debt prices to fall, reducing the value of trillions of dollars in fixed-rate bonds and loans that banks hold, regardless of whether they intend to sell the assets. In some cases, the losses were equal to or greater than banks’ equity, or the buffer they hold to absorb such hits. That led to a crisis that brought down three regional banks earlier this year. 

&gt;The ensuing volatility gave banks some relief: Investors seeking safety bought Treasury debt, lowering benchmark yields and helping raise prices across debt markets, including those for banks’ fixed-rate assets.

&gt;Since then, rates have rebounded as the panic subsided. Growth in emergency borrowing has slowed under the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program, created after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March to help banks with short-term liquidity needs. The program had $103 billion of loans outstanding at midyear, but is up only slightly since then to about $108 billion. Such loans, now at a fixed rate of 5.54%, must be repaid within a year and are considered a relatively expensive source of liquidity.

&gt;U.S. banks’ unrealized losses on investment securities were $558 billion as of June 30, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The unrealized losses were up from $516 billion three months earlier, but down from their peak of $690 billion at the end of last year’s third quarter. More than half of such losses each quarter were on bonds classified as “held-to-maturity,” and so not included on banks’ balance sheets under the accounting rules. At the end of 2021, unrealized losses were negligible systemwide.

&gt;Part of the reason unrealized losses were down from last year is that banks have reduced their bondholdings, often letting them roll off as they mature without reinvesting the proceeds into new debt securities. Banks’ bondholdings as of June 30 were down 12% from a year earlier, according to FDIC data.

&gt;In some instances, banks have elected to crystallize their losses by selling bonds below cost and taking the hit before matters got worse. On Friday, Royal Bank of Canada
said its Los Angeles-based unit, City National Bank, would recognize realized losses in the third quarter after selling certain debt securities to another part of RBC.

&gt;In addition, RBC said it had injected fresh capital into City National Bank. RBC didn’t say how large the losses or the capital injection were, but that the losses would be eliminated at the RBC consolidated level. It said City National reinvested most of the sale proceeds in new, higher-yielding securities.

&gt;The FDIC doesn’t publish fair-value data for loans, and only banks that are publicly traded are required to report such data. For the current 24 members of the KBW Bank Index, unrealized losses on loans were $143 billion as of June 30, up from $120 billion a quarter earlier, but down from $153 billion at year-end, according to a Wall Street Journal review of their filings. Before this year’s bank failures, the index had included Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank
and First Republic, which have been replaced in the index by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and First Horizon.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the wsj: &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/rising-rates-likely-hit-bank-balance-sheets-in-quarter-ebad3562""&gt;https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/rising-rates-likely-hit-bank-balance-sheets-in-quarter-ebad3562&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I believed, upon completion of 8 weeks, my original invested amount will be returned/credited to my bank account, and then there will be a new debit (I tried looking up on net and found this video, where the person does mention that amount will be credited - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTDUOOVZ5pQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTDUOOVZ5pQ)). 

However, I don't see any amount returned/credited to my bank after completion of 8 weeks. And there has been a reinvestment with another 8 week tbill (there is no new debit as well, so seems it used the same initially debited amount for reinvestment.).

Here is what happened with an example (not real numbers, but exact same scenario) -

invested $10K. got the rate of 5%. so initial amount deducted from bank account was = 10,000 - (10,000 \* 5% \* 8) /52 = $9923

my expectation was that $10K will be returned. so I earn that $76 from first 8 week investment. And then if the rate was around same 5%, it will deduct/debit $9923 again from my bank account for another 8 week investment.

Instead, it just reinvested that $9923 again. Didn't credit 10K into my bank account. Didn't deduct/debit new $9923 from my bank account.

Did I lose the interest earned on initial investment ? If it returns only 10,000, then I will get the interest only once instead of twice.

Or will it return me 76 (first interest earned) + 76 (interest from reinvestment) + 9923 = 10076 (or around that number)?

Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I'm pretty sure I would get some right answers here.

Last year December or so, JOLTs reading was about 11 million. J Powell said back then that there were about **1.7 jobs per individual** in the US which indicated a lot of options to choose from for a lot of people. Unemployment back then was about 3% iirc.

Now JOLTs reading has been declining steadily and is expected to come in at 8.8 million this week. While this doesn't correlate directly with unemployment, shouldn't there still be some effect of JOLTs on unemployment?

I mean I feel like there will be a tipping point and if JOLTs falls below a certain level, as such there's **&lt; 1 job per individual**, is obviously gonna trigger a spike in unemployment.

Not exactly rocket science but i think that this doesn't really get discussed as much as it should. People seem to look at JOLTs and unemployment individually and based on data, it seems that labour market is still really tight. Maybe the reality is that it is not and we aren't too far from the tipping point. And if this is indeed the case, there's gonna be a market sell off because ""unemployment is rising at an alarming rate"".

123,investing,"We have a 3% mortgage rate with $237K left to pay off. Our house is worth roughly $450K.

We have a $70K cash cushion available right now - that's after a separate 6 month expenses emergency fund ($30K in a HYSA for easy liquidity) and fully funding our 401Ks and backdoor IRAs, HSAs and some other small investments (eg. 529 for the kids). We are also automatically setting aside an additional $50K annually to savings (which is how we have built to $70K).

What should we do? I know - purposely broad question.

Dropping the $70K on our mortgage doesn't make sense because of HYSA, t-bills, and other stronger performing investment opportunities. But, we are eager to get into a nicer newer home made for modern day living.

Our neighborhood is old and charming so the lot value is crazy high per sq foot because of its location. The homes here are also highly rentable (long term, not short term rental) and could easily command the price of our mortgage monthly.

One thought is to wait and add to the $70K till we have a down payment on the nicer newer home we want, keep + rent our current place and just let that equity build for free, taking advantage of our low locked in rate. Doing this would result in a much higher interest rate and overall payment on our new home. We could afford it but would no longer be saving the full $50K automatically annually.

We could also sell our current place, forfeiting our current rate but cashing in on the ~$210K in equity + the $70K savings, making for a strong down payment on the new home, which would substantially lower payments even at a high interest rate. For reference, dream home is around $700K max.

Of course we could just invest the $70K + future $50K annually as it comes in, well diversified, stay where we are and keep paying down the current mortgage with moderate aggressiveness and using that total equity + cash stockpile later in life.

So as most people probably know the US Treasuries have been on an upwards trajectory with the 30 year at around 4.7% (Highest its been since 2007). Now since interest rate hiking and basically done (as it looks at the moment maybe another .25 hike) treasury yields seem to be almost at its peak.

You guys think starting a position in TLT to catch that upside as the treasury yields fall within the next 12-24 months. Dont think it will go to its 1.4% yields where TLT was at like $170. But I could see 2% treasuries and that definitely bring upside for TLT.

We have recently sent the money to my sister whose in Canada, fully in American cash, and she will put it in a safe for the time being.

We own nothing in Canada. We can't even afford to live there (Ontario), hence why we've temporarily moved back to our country of origin (My mother and I, my sister is a dental hygienist who lives with her boyfriend so she doesn't pay rent).

The idea of owning our own place is certainly appealing, especially if any rental profit helps mitigate some of the rent we'd have to pay in Canada.

We have considered Colombus Ohio and Michigan Detroit. I understand that being landlords from abroad won't be a walk in the park, but an investment in one of the two cities would bring about $1,100-$1,300 USD (obviously that won't be our monthly intake) monthly if we invest in a property that's within our price range, rentable, and strategically placed.

I like to equate stock picking with picking lottery numbers. There is too much randomness and chaos in the market.

158,investing,"Hello!

I've seen a lot of post where people suggest to invest money to HYSA right now instead of putting extra payments (principal) on the mortgage, assuming HYSA APY &gt; mortgage rate. I did some math with my current mortgage rate and my HYSA's APY (discover). Numbers below:

* Current APY = 4.3% (4.21% apr)
* Mortgage interest rate = 2.63%
* Loan = $150,000
* 30 years to pay.

I have 3 scenarios,

1. You put extra $1000 towards principal every month.

2. Instead of the principal, you put extra $1000 towards HYSA each month for 5 years ($66,652 after 5 years). Then pay your principal @ year 5 with $66,652. After that, you started putting $1000 towards your principal.

3. You have $60,000 and you fully invested it to your HYSA for 5 years ($74,030 assuming no monthly deposits were done). On year 5, you paid $74,030 towards principal and started adding $1000 on the following months.

Can't post a picture but an image link in the comments.


According to the math above, S1 will save you the most money (least interest) but it will take you the longest to pay. S2 and S3 almost have the same savings but S3 will have you paying the loan the earliest.

Someone please clarify this to me. I feel like I'm missing something.

Thanks!

I figured I'd give this a shot to see if they are able to do any better than what I've been doing on my own (I believe I picked the most aggressive option they offered).

Up until now, my investment strategy hasn't really been much of a strategy, I just buy as much VOO as the wife will let me in a Roth IRA I opened at Vanguard and plan to sit on it for the next 20-30 years. I've been doing this since about 2010.

I have been risk averse, so most of it is in Blue Chip Tech companies who are well positioned to take advantage of the upcoming technological revolutions but also have solid revenue making product moats.

As I look towards diversifying my portfolio, I am struggling to find any industry that also meets the following demands:

* Solid products that will make money today and 50 years from now
* Sane P/E ratios (Keep it under 50 at least)
* Poised to take advantage of one of the upcoming technological revolutions (ie. can expand their market)
* Hard to beat Moat

Manufacturing companies are slowly revolutionizing, but I don't see their market expanding in a fashion that lets their stocks explode. Many others like mining &amp; energy seem to be so heavily regulated, that your investment is more a reflection of trust in the political class than the actual industry. 

The compute hardware industry makes sense to me, but I am already invested in non-Nvidia players and it is too close to Tech anyway. Novo Nordisk satisfied all those requirements, and I was planning on investing in it in January. Dragged my feet with it, and the train has passed.

43/male with pension that will cover all monthly living expenses starting at age 50
No debt/house paid
401k current value for me and wife roughly 2 million (max contributions every year)
Roth IRAs around 200k
175k cash
45k in individual dividend stocks

I am adding $1500 per week to my cash position right now. I am considering the following options:

Option 1: SCHD and VIG (65/35 split) - dollar cost into this at $2000 a week. That’s a bit over 700k in investment capital for the 7 years I have left. With growth (hopefully), it should be close to 1 million. The dividend would not quite get me to 3k per month, but I can supplement if i need. 

Option 2: 100% VTSAX - dollar cost into this at $2000 a week. That should also be around a million.  Then I just draw down at 3k per month. That should last for over 25 years and then I can move over to using our 401ks if it gets too depleted. 

I see option 1 being a slight tax drag, but like the idea of not selling shares. I also see the risk of SCHD not performing as well as VTSAX or companies cutting dividends. I also like VIG as it has good growth and dividend growth, but low yield.

Maybe another option is to stay cash getting over 5% until they drop rates. Obviously I might miss stocks popping up when rates drop. 

What are your opinion on this? Any other options I am not thinking of?

178,investing,"I'm considering investing in a NY muni money market fund as a form of tax-advantaged savings. For a high income earner in New York City, the tax-adjusted returns for short term NY munis currently exceed the tax adjusted yield from treasuries. But when I look at the average yield trend for any NY muni fund, they look way more volatile than I would expect. Take SWYXX as an example, which holds 0-3 month NY municipal bonds

[https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/resource/swyxx-snyxx-fact-sheet](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/resource/swyxx-snyxx-fact-sheet)

Every month, the seven-day average yield trend goes way up, then way down in a cyclical fashion. Given that the safe rate of return has steadily been creeping up (look at the yield trend of a 0-3 month treasury fund or ETF like SGOV), what could explain the yield trend behaving the way it does? Does it reflect changing yields of the underlying bonds themselves , or rather something about the way the money market fund operates?

Additionally, at the bottom parts of the seven-day yield trend, the money market fund's tax-adjusted yield is less than the yield of a short term treasury bill, even for the extreme case of an individual who makes the absolute highest marginal tax rate in NYC. So rationally, why would anyone keep their money in the money market fund?

EDIT: [This article](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/municipal-money-market-yield-volatility) gives some explanation for it. But then it makes me wonder, if I don't need immediate liquidity, but do not want to buy individual muni bonds, is there any way to invest in short-term munis and avoid the fluctuations in 7-day yield?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m considering investing in a NY muni money market fund as a form of tax-advantaged savings.

But when I look at the average yield trend for any NY muni fund, they look way more volatile than I would expect. Take SWYXX as an example, which holds 0-3 month NY municipal bonds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/resource/swyxx-snyxx-fact-sheet""&gt;https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/resource/swyxx-snyxx-fact-sheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every month, the seven-day average yield trend goes way up, then way down in a cyclical fashion. Given that the safe rate of return has steadily been creeping up (look at the yield trend of a 0-3 month treasury fund or ETF like SGOV), what could explain the yield trend behaving the way it does? Does it reflect changing yields of the underlying bonds themselves , or rather something about the way the money market fund operates?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, at the bottom parts of the seven-day yield trend, the money market fund&amp;#39;s tax-adjusted yield is less than the yield of a short term treasury bill, even for the extreme case of an individual who makes the absolute highest marginal tax rate in NYC. So rationally, why would anyone keep their money in the money market fund?&lt;/p&gt;

183,investing,"Wall Street Journal out with an article that lets you plug in 5 simple variables to get a valuation for Tesla.

The 5 variables are: how many cars Tesla sells in 2030, average selling price of a Tesla car in 2030 in today’s dollars, operating margin, cost of capital, and how much Tesla’s other operations are worth.

The Wall Street Journal has 4 pre-set scenarios:

1. Bearish - $58.5 billion valuation based on 5 million cars at $30k with 8% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $0 valuation for other operations besides cars

2. Default - $381 billion valuation based on 7 million cars at $30k with 10% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $200 billion valuation for other operations.

3. Bullish - $770 billion valuation based on 10 million cars at $30k with 12% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, $400 billion for other operations

4. Superfan - $2.33 trillion valuation based on 20 million cars at $30k with 15% operating margin, 8% cost of capital, $600 billion for other operations

Their assumptions are as follows:

&gt; Our model is based on estimates of Tesla’s future cash flows. It multiplies anticipated vehicle sales in 2030 by the average anticipated price to calculate revenue, and then applies the expected operating margin to arrive at operating profit. Estimates for the years before 2030 assume a smooth path in the variables from this year’s FactSet analyst consensus.

&gt; Operating profit is taxed at an 11% rate (FactSet consensus for Tesla in 2023). Cash flows are then calculated as posttax operating profit minus capital expenditures while adding back depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures are assumed to be a flat 7% of revenue and depreciation and amortization 20% of capital expenditures.

&gt; Estimated cash flows through 2030 are discounted back to their present value at the discount rate and aggregated. A terminal value is added to account for Tesla’s cash flows beyond 2030, assuming a steady-state growth rate of 5%. The total of all these discounted estimated cash flows gives the theoretical enterprise value of Tesla’s core automotive business now.

&gt; We have left the value of its other businesses as a separate assumption within the model to arrive at a total enterprise value. Market value would also include the company’s cash or debt position, which we have not modeled.

Personally, as a Tesla bull who owns the stock, I believe Tesla is worth north of $1 trillion based on 10 million cars at $38k and 17% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, and $200B for other operations. I also believe that assuming 5% terminal growth post 2030 is too low.

I'm no expert in investing but I just need to know if I need to move my money elsewhere. Over 3 years I contributed 10k to an Empower retirement account through work and I've only gotten a 1.1% return. Again, I'm not knowledgeable at all in investing but that sounds bad. 

Anecdotal but as a personal experiment I decided to try investing myself with pretty much zero knowledge in a Fidelity account just picking stocks at a whim and have a 7% return. Although I may have just gotten lucky I feel like a professionally managed account (which my Empower account supposedly is) should be getting a much higher return than someone just playing around picking stocks willy nilly.

EDIT: Ok I didn't provide enough info for everyone (again, I'm not terribly knowledgeable with this stuff) so here's the info everyone was requesting. Also note the way it's set up, I don't pick individual anything, I just choose what category and they do the rest. I chose ""Moderate/Aggressive"" as my category since it's what it recommended.

197,investing,"Hello everyone,

I (22M) just graduated college and I'm earning \~85k. I'm currently renting an apartment for $1500/month and this is on the lower end based on where I live. I was curious about purchasing a condo, as morgage payments seem to be much lower than rent and you get to build equity on the property. However, I plan on staying in this area for a few years then moving to a different part of the country, and renting out this property afterwards. I am not looking to  purchase a property within a minimum of two years, due to interest rates, housing costs, a lack of tax returns, and just building up my savings.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I was thinking what considerations go into this? Do you have any experience buying a property than ""converting"" it to a rental property after you move out? Apart from total monthly expenses (mortgage, interest rate, property tax, repair/maintenance, HOA fees, insurance), are there any monetary factors to consider?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a good reason to form an LLC when buying the property or when renting it out? Are there any tax advantages of doing so? I'd imagine if it's an older property, then this would be beneficial as you can reduce your tax burden during repair or maintenance.

203,investing,"Background: I have \~$60K in a Roth IRA that's invested in a basic weighted S&amp;P 500 fund. My regular 401K is also invested in basic index funds, and I'd like to do something different with the Roth. I have two philosophical issues with standard index funds. 

First, because they are weighted to market cap, a relatively small handful of stocks make up most of the index (The top 10 companies make up 30%).  I don't care how big Apple is, or their historical gains, I don't want a single stock composing 7% of my investments.

Secondly, I have moral/ethical concerns with a few of the large companies (who doesn't?), and I don't want my money going to buy their stock, even indirectly through a large index fund. I don't sleep well knowing I might profit from companies doing things that I believe are immoral and/or deeply irresponsible.

Problem: Anything other than a standard weight index fund will have large management fees. Even a 0.5% management fee will take a sizable cut from profits over 20-30 years.

So if it costs $0 to trade, could I just use an online broker to manually buy 100s of stocks, as long as I can buy fractional amounts?  Even if I rebalance once or twice a year, it could be thousands of trades. But it's a Roth IRA, so I don't have to worry about tracking gains/losses for tax purposes.

My regular 401K is also invested in basic index funds, and I&amp;#39;d like to do something different with the Roth. I have two philosophical issues with standard index funds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, because they are weighted to market cap, a relatively small handful of stocks make up most of the index (The top 10 companies make up 30%).  I don&amp;#39;t care how big Apple is, or their historical gains, I don&amp;#39;t want a single stock composing 7% of my investments.&lt;/p&gt;

If into the rollover, was planning on throwing it at all VTI, but not sure what to do with the individual  investment account after that.

Should I scrap any or all of these thoughts and start CHET accounts first the kids instead.

None of it is needed now, this is all with a long term mindset.

Does anyone know if a site where you can search a mutual fund and it lists its holdings with individual % change for each holding? 

I ask because the NAV is calculated and posted hours after market close. If one can see the individual holdings’ % change intra-day, you can gauge where NAV will be. If the top 20 holdings are all around -2%, you can assume the NAV will settle around  -2% on the fund.

227,investing,"Hi all, figured I'd do an update since my last post got so much traction. Please look at my history if you'd like to see previous post.

The first texts I received from him in September (after our 2 month hiatus), he said we could drop the IUL - great, I thought he got the hint. Set up a meeting last week with which he spent the entire 1.5 hr slot into asking why I didn't want to do the IUL and trying to convince me we should still do it. Again, sounded good and I had a better understanding of the product. He agrees to reduce the initial deposit from 100k to 50-60k and sends me the 52 page application again (with 60k written on the initial contribution line). For a second time, reading the contract made it clear to me that this was not what I wanted in my investing portfolio.

The following Monday (after my initial post on this subreddit), I again told him I will not be following through with the IUL with which he asked me to specify why. I said ""It's 52 pages of stipulations, you want me to specify one?"" His response: ""is there something specific or because there's so many pages?"" I recognized his snarky remarks, but left it alone. I kept it short and sweet because I wasn't in the mood to argue, my answer was still no. His words : ""I can see we are not ready for this level of investing."" I could literally feel the tantrum he was having 13 states away and it did bring me some pleasure. 

However, the passive aggressiveness continued. I received an email this morning with an attachment of a page from a book with the headline saying ""Investing Roadblock: Procrastination"". Was he seriously insinuating that I was ""procrastinating"" because I didn't want to go through with the IUL? I was LIVID. Next reply was me requesting dissolution of the contract and for full refund that the contract CLEARLY STATES I deserve if I am not satisfied with the service or recommendations. He was paid upfront for one year ($1500). Well, this was his response -
"" [...] People hire me to make the best decisions possible and challenge them when making questionable ones. [...]

As for a refund, we have spent numerous presentations and hours with you educating on all options and you have chosen to go against the advice without reason so unfortunately, we will not be able to provide a refund.  Best of luck in your future endeavors!""

I won't go off on here like I did in my email to the firm's CFO, but how DARE he, the self-entitled prick! I got into contact with the firm and received the refund in full, an apology from the administration (they were good people), and a promise that he will be dealt with. 

You try to break a legally binding contract and I'll come after you. I am thinking of reporting him to FINRA and SEC, but am unsure if these are the correct institutions for a formal complaint? I'll reiterate that the firm he works for has good people in it.

On the morning of 26 September 2023, TD Ameritrade customers in Singapore received an email stating that TD Ameritrade now intends to focus on Accredited Investors only, which are defined as individuals with:

* Personal income in excess of S$300,000 per year (or its equivalent in foreign currency)
* Net personal assets in excess of S$2,000,000 including residence (or its equivalent in foreign currency)
* Net personal financial assets in excess of S$1,000,000 (or its equivalent in foreign currency)

This expectedly excludes the large majority of retail investors.

**Beginning 27 October 2023, all remaining non-Accredited Investor accounts** will be charged a monthly account maintenance fee of USD$50. Accounts with balances less than USD$50 will only be charged an amount to reduce their cash balance to $0 (zero).

**As of U.S. market close on 1 December 2023**, non-Accredited Investor accounts will be restricted. We will no longer accept new trade orders to establish positions or deposits on any remaining accounts. However, you may still place liquidating orders to close positions.

**Starting at U.S. market open on 4 December 2023**, any remaining accounts (excluding those of Accredited Investors) with a debit balance (margin loan financed by securities lending) may have positions liquidated to bring these accounts to a zero or positive cash balance. We will no longer offer securities financing. 

Now Singapore is a small country that would be perfect as a sandbox to gauge the impact of a pivot in customer segments on TD Ameritrade's business. If it turns out well, I speculate that the pivot could be scaled to other markets as well.

Time to move to IBKR I guess.

251,investing,"30 year Treasury Bonds are yielding close to 4.7% right now. This will almost certainly be beat out by the market over the longterm, but what if you buy longterm treasuries but only hold them for a short(ish) term. 

The federal funds rate is (in my opinion) nearly peaked. I believe there will be 1 more rate hike this year and possibly 1 more in early 2024 before the Fed pauses and then begins reducing the federal funds rate down to the ~2.5% mark around 2026/2027. At this point, wouldn’t all of the treasury rates fall significantly from their current highs? This in turn would mean that the higher yielding treasuries bought today would be sold a significant premium because they would still have 25+ years to maturity at a significantly higher rate than what could be bought at auction. 

If I did my calculations correctly, a treasury yielding 4.7% with 27 years to maturity would be trading at a ~21% premium if the market rate for new 30 year treasuries drops to 3.5%. So if these assumptions are true, you would get a 4.7% annual return on your investment + an additional 21% return at the end of 3 years for a 35.1% return over a 3 year period on a risk free asset.

Say you and I both have an annual gross income of $50,000, akin to ordinary people we save only the leftover after expense on living necessities, what differentiates us are the following two things:   


1. How much leftover we have: I hold that life is too short to be wasted so I am not interested in keeping a large sum of money in my banking account, $5,000 each year is way too good for me, yet you are down to save $10,000 each year and willing to half your needs.   


2. I am a bit smarter and having more luck than you, that makes my annual return rate tripled outperform yours by 10% each year (lets say 5% vs. 15%).

**Saving is not hard,** I may still fail to realize 15% 10-yr CAGR after having a master degree on finance but you don’t have to be educated to know how to save. You just had a best time than I ever did bro.  
Saving is a certainty, but investing is not. You are saving $100 if you put $100 in your account, I may lose all if I bought, lets say $100 AMC shares.  


**Saving also enhances our flexibility**.  
The variables in our life is incalculable. Sometimes it brings luck, sometimes is just not that good, we have to learn to accept the reality even though it could blow us off the ground.  
But if you have some flexibility, at the very least you will have a soft landing when you are falling: you don’t quit the job at the expense of quitting the investment, you don’t pay the emergency bills at the expense of quitting the investment, and you don’t even have to ask someone for a hand because you have some in your saving account.

The immediate thought is doing a Backdoor Roth IRA and... I got myself into a bit of a pickle here. About a year ago I rolled over an old 401K into a Groundfloor (Peer-to-Peer Lending) Traditional IRA and I'm in the process of transferring most of the cash over to an Traditional IRA on Fidelity.

However... I have have $5K left in the Groundfloor ""LROs"" and all but $450 are non-performing or in default. 

If I understand correctly if I want to do a Backdoor IRA the ""pro rata"" rule applies and I'll need to calculate pre-tax and post-tax allocations. This also means I'll be paying tax on $4.5K of money that I'm probably never going to see again. This feels like a bad idea. 

So until those losses are reflected on the Groundfloor IRA I see myself having two options: 

  * Contribute to a Traditional IRA and don't take a deduction, or
  * Contribute to a Brokerage Account

I'm strongly leaning towards the latter as I feel it gives me flexibility while not losing too much of a tax advantage.

&lt;p&gt;So until those losses are reflected on the Groundfloor IRA I see myself having two options: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to a Traditional IRA and don&amp;#39;t take a deduction, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to a Brokerage Account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m strongly leaning towards the latter as I feel it gives me flexibility while not losing too much of a tax advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also learned my lesson and will not be ducking around with novel investments in retirement accounts without consulting a professional in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

\_\_\_\_\_\_  
A few years ago as a college freshman, I inherited about $45k and at the time didn't need it (received college scholarship) so I invested $43k in VOO. I didn't feel safe keeping it in my bank account as my abusive family had access so that's the choice I made knowing they wouldn't find out about it.

  
Now that I'm fresh out of college (studied CS), I moved back home to save money while I look for a job in software engineering. In the meantime, I work retail part-time and save a large portion of my paycheck (which isn't much)). I want to bulk up my emergency savings- but with retail its difficult, and the job search is taking longer than expected.

  
I thought about selling 3-4k worth of shares from VOO and putting it into a HYSA for my emergency savings. I currently have just $2k in my savings, and would need quite a bit if I move out in a year from now.

  
I have no net gains on that $43k, just about a $300 overall loss. Will I have to worry about any taxes or penalties if I do this?

Two commonly used orders, the sell limit and take profit orders, may appear similar at first glance, but they have distinct roles in the world of trading.

  
**Sell Limit Order**  
Think of a sell limit order as your golden ticket to ride the market's upswing. With this order, you set a specific price at which you're ready to sell an asset. However, here's the catch: the order will only execute if the market price climbs to or surpasses the price you've set.  This order type is particularly handy for traders who anticipate an asset's price will rise before potentially reversing.

  
**Take Profit Order**  
Take profit orders – your safety net for locking in profits. When you place a take profit order, you're essentially setting a predetermined price at which your position will automatically close, securing your hard-earned gains. It's like having a financial safety net that ensures you don't get too greedy and risk losing your profits.

  
In a nutshell, the main difference lies in their purpose: sell limit orders are your entry ticket at a specific price, while take profit orders are your insurance policy to lock in profits.

I think it might be a bit much so I was thinking of dropping the small cap and VTI. 

Also what are thoughts on CCRV? Seems to good to be true but it looks attractive for the div payout. No major growth but 30% yield. There has to be a catch, and I'm just not realizing it. 


And what are thoughts on tossing some of the big holding in the large cap index's such as apple/XOM/msft/Amazon. I know the obvious, more risk but bigger upside and that's tempting but then i know there is a lot of apple in VGT/VOO for example.

I moved most of my emergency fund into my brokerage account just before the holiday and purchased Visa (V) with it.  I discovered I couldn’t set stop losses and automatic triggers to sell to lock in gains on the same shares.  This ended up being quite stressful for me as I tried to set stops (for loss and gain) on portions of the shares, leaving me exposed to losses on some of the shares.  I was monitoring these shares daily, wondering if gains were temporary and what would happen the next day.  Should I lock in small gains to ensure I didn’t lose, or should I let it run?  I lump sum purchased and sold in four lots.  I tried to sell in a way to lock in minimal profit, but leave room to make more.  In the end, it was an unpleasant experience.

I moved most of my emergency fund into my brokerage account just before the holiday and purchased Visa (V) with it.  I discovered I couldn’t set stop losses and automatic triggers to sell to lock in gains on the same shares.  This ended up being quite stressful for me as I tried to set stops (for loss and gain) on portions of the shares, leaving me exposed to losses on some of the shares.  I was monitoring these shares daily, wondering if gains were temporary and what would happen the next day.  Should I lock in small gains to ensure I didn’t lose, or should I let it run?  I lump sum purchased and sold in four lots.  I tried to sell in a way to lock in minimal profit, but leave room to make more.  In the end, it was an unpleasant experience.

314,investing,"Hi everyone,

Three years ago, I started forcing myself to gain some financial literacy, because I had literally NONE. It's been a great journey from squandering my grandfather's inheritance, building up my credit card debt (the higher the number the better, right?) and being delinquent in paying capital gains tax. Well at this point, I'm debt free and have been investing for 18 months.

  
r/personalfinance was my introduction to the index style of investing. I read some Bogle literature and opened an IRA with Vanguard. My holdings are currently 90% VT, 10% AVUV and I intend to keep it mostly that way. I might diversify my SCV with another Avantis fund, but not more than 10% SCV total. I contribute $542/month, so this will be my second-year maxing contributions. 

  
In considering time horizons for different purposes, I realized that if I don't make a line item in my budget for a house downpayment and put it in treasuries or something, it will never happen. Even though it's controversial, I elected to invest these funds in equities for a 5-10+ year time horizon. If it's a bear market I'll just keep renting, whatever. I'm not comfortable borrowing from my IRA and I wouldn't borrow from my 401K either if I had one. Basically, I opened a brokerage account with Vanguard and contribute like $80/month. Of course, I'll up that number soon, but that's where I am. My holdings are 65% VTI, 20% QQQM &amp; 15% VXUS, but I'm having other ideas in line with value investing. 

  
To narrow down exactly what I'm asking, this account is for a specific purpose, a house. I have a separate chunk of money I keep in a MMF that is for buying my next car in cash, which will likely happen within the next 3 years (Toyota at 248,000 going strong). A set dollar amount each month goes into that account. My plan is that once I have to buy my next car, I'll immediately start INVESTING (not saving) the equivalent of a car payment each month. I'd be investing that money because I shouldn't need another car for 12-15 years. Depending on what the market is doing, I could even move some to bonds 5 years out. The crux of my question is: Does it make sense to keep this NEXT car fund money in a separate brokerage account from the home downpayment funds, or is it more practical if I lump it all together? I like the idea of having separate accounts for different purposes, but I wonder if I'd be missing out on some compounding gains by doing that. I don't know if the extra account would be worth the headache. 

  
Since I'm using more of the indexing approach with my IRA, I'll probably keep it with Vanguard. For the brokerage account, I've thought about moving it to Fidelity simply because they allow you to buy fractional shares. I don't like that Vanguard only lets you buy whole shares of non-Vanguard funds. I just ordered ""The Intelligent Investor"" and am planning on learning how to do a proper valuation. I want to build a portfolio of good companies (and at least 50% VTWAX!) that are on sale. Some will likely be buy and hold for a long time, some may just be a couple or a few years if I decide to trim winners or write off losers. Something is always on sale. I want to be able to pick a few companies, conduct a thorough valuation and allocate an equal percentage of a given lump sum to each. I might not even keep my allocation of individual companies above 10%. If it does well, it'll fund my safer investments. If it goes poorly, then I'm sure I'll take away a powerful life lesson somehow.   
Any suggestions are welcome. Have a great weekend!

# From Finch Beaks to Financial Peaks: Understanding Genetic Algorithms

Remember high school biology where you learned about Charles Darwin and his theory of natural selection? Darwin studied finches in the Galápagos Islands and noticed that they had different beak shapes, each finely tuned for their specific diets — some for cracking seeds, others for sipping nectar, and yet others for capturing insects. Over time, the finches with the most useful beak shapes survived and had baby finches, passing along their “winning” traits.

In the realm of computational science, particularly in the domain of optimizing algorithms, a similar evolutionary process takes place through a methodology known as genetic optimization. Imagine you are developing an algorithm to forecast stock market behavior. Various iterations of your algorithm demonstrate distinct strengths: some may excel in volatile environments, while others may be optimized for long-term trends. Genetic optimization acts as the computational equivalent of the Galápagos Islands; it identifies the top-performing strategies and combines their most effective features to create a new generation of even more robust algorithms.

# The Six Pillars of Genetic Optimization: A Biological Symphony in Code

Imagine you’re on the Galápagos Islands, watching a group of finches go about their lives. Some have beaks crafted for nectar sipping, while others have sturdy beaks perfect for cracking seeds. These distinct features aren’t random; they’re survival tactics, granting each bird access to a specific food source. Now, consider a finch family with both long and short-beaked parents. They have four chicks, and by a stroke of genetic fortune, one inherits a beak even longer than her long-beaked parent. This unique feature gives her exclusive access to deeper flowers, while her siblings with mid-length beaks struggle to specialize in either nectar or seeds. In this harsh survival game, her specialized feature gives her the upper hand. Yep, it’s survival of the fittest, Darwin-style.When we think of genetic optimization, we’re essentially talking about a six-step process, repeated over and over until we achieve our optimal solution. These steps are:

1. **Initialization**: Setting the Population and Fitness Metrics
2. **Selection**: Choosing the Fittest Candidates
3. **Crossover**: Mixing Traits (Recombination)
4. **Mutation**: Introducing Random Changes
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the New Generation
6. **Replacement**: Swapping Out the Old for the New

In this exploration, we’ll delve into each of these pillars to understand how the age-old wisdom of biology serves as the muse for modern algorithmic optimization. Each of these steps, intricately modeled after natural processes, works in concert to refine and evolve our algorithms toward the pinnacle of performance.

**Initialization: The Genesis of Algorithmic Optimization**

In the natural world, every ecosystem begins with a diverse population — be it finches on an island, bacteria in a petri dish, or whales in the ocean. In the realm of computing, our “population” is what we aim to optimize, and it’s often encoded as a string of numbers.Consider the world of algorithmic trading: we kick-start the process with a variety of trading portfolio strategies. Some might be conservative, triggering stop losses at a mere -3% and aiming for gains at +3%. Others might be more adventurous, with stop losses set at -30% and profits at +30%. These different portfolios make up our initial population.

After we have an entire population, we’ll convert each of our portfolios into an array of numbers. This is especially important for later parts of the algorithm like selection and mutation.

[We create many variations of a portfolio, then convert them into an array or tree-like structure](https://i.imgur.com/vuWpTBB.png)

After we have our population of individuals, we need to decide what it means to be a “fit” individual. For algorithmic trading, one way we can do this is by running trading simulations or backtests. We can then use the performance of the backtest and optimize for certain metrics, like sharpe ratio, percent change, or drawdown.

[We can optimize for different metrics, including percent change, maximum drawdown, and sharpe ratio.](https://i.imgur.com/KsrA3yb.png)

**Selection and Crossover — How our strategies “breed”**

Just as nature selects the fittest organisms to carry on their genes, so does our algorithm pick the best portfolios for the next generation. Though selection can be random, more often, it leans towards those that are ‘fit,’ or in our case, portfolios that perform well based on our chosen metrics.For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say individuals in a population mate at random. In our portfolio example, that means taking a random pair from the population and combining their genetic information.

[Two common forms of Crossover are “Random Crossover” and N-Point Crossover. The important thing here is that an offspring that looks like both parents is generated](https://i.imgur.com/ETp6kvw.png)

We perform this crossover operation tens, hundreds, or thousands of times. One common heuristic is to generate a new population that’s the same size as the old population. With that, we’ve now doubled our population size. Incredible!

**Mutation — Introducing Variation in the Population**

Let’s return to our Galápagos finches. Mutations in their genetic code might lead to subtle changes in beak size or shape. Most of these changes may be inconsequential or even detrimental. But every so often, a mutation could result in a beak perfectly suited for a previously untapped food source, allowing a finch lineage to dominate a new ecological niche.In the algorithmic world, mutations serve a similar disruptive yet constructive purpose. They introduce randomness into the genetic optimization process, helping to avoid local minima and explore the vast landscape of possible solutions. Just like biological mutations, algorithmic mutations can sometimes produce undesirable outcomes. However, on occasion, they can bring forth truly ingenious solutions that would not have been achievable through conventional methods. For example, in an algorithm designed for trading, a mutation might alter the parameters used to calculate the optimal point to buy or sell a stock. While this change may initially appear random and potentially harmful, it could unlock a strategy that significantly outperforms its predecessors.In practice, a mutation is typically performed by altering one or more elements in the array that represents a portfolio or any other object of optimization. The extent and impact of this mutation can vary widely. A “soft” mutation might involve the adjustment of a single parameter, such as the percentage at which a stop-loss order is triggered. In contrast, a “hard” mutation could involve significant alterations to multiple elements in the array, akin to a large-scale genetic mutation in a biological context. It is worth noting that the absence of physical constraints in the computational domain allows for a greater range of possible mutations compared to biological systems.

[A mutation alters the offspring in some way that’s distinct from characteristics of their parents](https://i.imgur.com/s5zGI8S.png)

Both in nature and in algorithms, mutations serve as one of the critical mechanisms for driving evolutionary progress, pushing boundaries both in the organic and digital realms.

**Evaluation and Replacement**

In biological ecosystems like Darwin’s Galápagos Islands, the process of evaluation is a relentless one, executed by the natural environment. Those organisms ill-suited to their surroundings — such as finches with beak shapes that do not facilitate efficient foraging — find their survival and reproductive prospects severely compromised. Conversely, organisms exhibiting advantageous traits not only survive but also pass these traits to subsequent generations, contributing to the evolutionary success of their lineage.Drawing a parallel to algorithmic trading, the evaluation phase serves a comparable function. Here, each portfolio, optimized for particular market conditions, undergoes an exhaustive evaluation process. This involves running a series of backtests and simulations that quantify their performance based on specific metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, percent change, and maximum drawdown. These metrics function as the ‘fitness criteria,’ allowing us to identify which portfolios are most capable of meeting or exceeding predetermined trading objectives.

[We convert the child back to a portfolio and evaluate its performance](https://i.imgur.com/iXh8iN3.png)

Upon the completion of the crossover and mutation stages, the newly created ‘child’ portfolios are reintroduced into the existing population. Each member of this augmented population is then evaluated based on the aforementioned performance metrics. Subsequently, the entire population is sorted in descending order of their fitness scores. To maintain population size and focus the evolutionary pressure, the least fit individuals are culled, leaving a new generation of portfolios that is incrementally superior to its predecessor.

[Evaluate the performance of all portfolios in the population, then retain only the top-performing ones, thus ensuring that each new generation is more fit than the last.](https://i.imgur.com/abKpe8z.png)

# Conclusion: Bridging Biology and Algorithmic Trading through Genetic Optimization

Artificial Intelligence is undeniably a multifaceted discipline that transcends mere language models or data classifiers. It is an embodiment of our drive to replicate and even surpass the efficiencies and wisdom found in nature. Genetic optimization serves as a striking testament to this truth, translating the principles of biological evolution into computational practices that refine and optimize algorithmic systems.Leveraging genetic optimization in the world of algorithmic trading offers us a cutting-edge approach to navigating the complex, dynamic landscape of the financial markets. Like Darwin’s finches, our trading algorithms evolve, adapt, and improve over time, driven by the unyielding forces of simulated natural selection. This technology, much like nature itself, offers no guarantees, but it does provide a framework for sustainable development and, potentially, remarkable innovation.Through the six pillars — Initialization, Selection, Crossover, Mutation, Evaluation, and Replacement — we’ve looked at how the science of genetics can inform and enrich our algorithms. Each pillar not only simulates a specific aspect of the natural evolutionary process but also serves as a critical component in our quest for computational excellence.For those of us who bridge disparate fields like biology and finance, the application of genetic optimization to algorithmic trading is more than just a technical achievement. It’s an exciting symbiosis of natural wisdom and artificial intelligence, and a potent reminder that in the world of AI, the possibilities are as limitless as evolution itself.

Some might be conservative, triggering stop losses at a mere -3% and aiming for gains at +3%. Others might be more adventurous, with stop losses set at -30% and profits at +30%. These different portfolios make up our initial population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we have an entire population, we’ll convert each of our portfolios into an array of numbers. This is especially important for later parts of the algorithm like selection and mutation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/vuWpTBB.png""&gt;We create many variations of a portfolio, then convert them into an array or tree-like structure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we have our population of individuals, we need to decide what it means to be a “fit” individual. For algorithmic trading, one way we can do this is by running trading simulations or backtests. We can then use the performance of the backtest and optimize for certain metrics, like sharpe ratio, percent change, or drawdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/KsrA3yb.png""&gt;We can optimize for different metrics, including percent change, maximum drawdown, and sharpe ratio.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selection and Crossover — How our strategies “breed”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as nature selects the fittest organisms to carry on their genes, so does our algorithm pick the best portfolios for the next generation. Though selection can be random, more often, it leans towards those that are ‘fit,’ or in our case, portfolios that perform well based on our chosen metrics.For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say individuals in a population mate at random. In our portfolio example, that means taking a random pair from the population and combining their genetic information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/ETp6kvw.png""&gt;Two common forms of Crossover are “Random Crossover” and N-Point Crossover. The important thing here is that an offspring that looks like both parents is generated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We perform this crossover operation tens, hundreds, or thousands of times. One common heuristic is to generate a new population that’s the same size as the old population. With that, we’ve now doubled our population size. Incredible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutation — Introducing Variation in the Population&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s return to our Galápagos finches. Mutations in their genetic code might lead to subtle changes in beak size or shape. Most of these changes may be inconsequential or even detrimental. But every so often, a mutation could result in a beak perfectly suited for a previously untapped food source, allowing a finch lineage to dominate a new ecological niche.In the algorithmic world, mutations serve a similar disruptive yet constructive purpose. They introduce randomness into the genetic optimization process, helping to avoid local minima and explore the vast landscape of possible solutions. Just like biological mutations, algorithmic mutations can sometimes produce undesirable outcomes. However, on occasion, they can bring forth truly ingenious solutions that would not have been achievable through conventional methods. For example, in an algorithm designed for trading, a mutation might alter the parameters used to calculate the optimal point to buy or sell a stock. While this change may initially appear random and potentially harmful, it could unlock a strategy that significantly outperforms its predecessors.In practice, a mutation is typically performed by altering one or more elements in the array that represents a portfolio or any other object of optimization. The extent and impact of this mutation can vary widely. A “soft” mutation might involve the adjustment of a single parameter, such as the percentage at which a stop-loss order is triggered. In contrast, a “hard” mutation could involve significant alterations to multiple elements in the array, akin to a large-scale genetic mutation in a biological context. It is worth noting that the absence of physical constraints in the computational domain allows for a greater range of possible mutations compared to biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/s5zGI8S.png""&gt;A mutation alters the offspring in some way that’s distinct from characteristics of their parents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both in nature and in algorithms, mutations serve as one of the critical mechanisms for driving evolutionary progress, pushing boundaries both in the organic and digital realms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation and Replacement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In biological ecosystems like Darwin’s Galápagos Islands, the process of evaluation is a relentless one, executed by the natural environment. Those organisms ill-suited to their surroundings — such as finches with beak shapes that do not facilitate efficient foraging — find their survival and reproductive prospects severely compromised. Conversely, organisms exhibiting advantageous traits not only survive but also pass these traits to subsequent generations, contributing to the evolutionary success of their lineage.Drawing a parallel to algorithmic trading, the evaluation phase serves a comparable function. Here, each portfolio, optimized for particular market conditions, undergoes an exhaustive evaluation process. This involves running a series of backtests and simulations that quantify their performance based on specific metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, percent change, and maximum drawdown. These metrics function as the ‘fitness criteria,’ allowing us to identify which portfolios are most capable of meeting or exceeding predetermined trading objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/iXh8iN3.png""&gt;We convert the child back to a portfolio and evaluate its performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon the completion of the crossover and mutation stages, the newly created ‘child’ portfolios are reintroduced into the existing population. Each member of this augmented population is then evaluated based on the aforementioned performance metrics. Subsequently, the entire population is sorted in descending order of their fitness scores. To maintain population size and focus the evolutionary pressure, the least fit individuals are culled, leaving a new generation of portfolios that is incrementally superior to its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/abKpe8z.png""&gt;Evaluate the performance of all portfolios in the population, then retain only the top-performing ones, thus ensuring that each new generation is more fit than the last.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion: Bridging Biology and Algorithmic Trading through Genetic Optimization&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence is undeniably a multifaceted discipline that transcends mere language models or data classifiers. It is an embodiment of our drive to replicate and even surpass the efficiencies and wisdom found in nature. Genetic optimization serves as a striking testament to this truth, translating the principles of biological evolution into computational practices that refine and optimize algorithmic systems.Leveraging genetic optimization in the world of algorithmic trading offers us a cutting-edge approach to navigating the complex, dynamic landscape of the financial markets. Like Darwin’s finches, our trading algorithms evolve, adapt, and improve over time, driven by the unyielding forces of simulated natural selection. This technology, much like nature itself, offers no guarantees, but it does provide a framework for sustainable development and, potentially, remarkable innovation.Through the six pillars — Initialization, Selection, Crossover, Mutation, Evaluation, and Replacement — we’ve looked at how the science of genetics can inform and enrich our algorithms. Each pillar not only simulates a specific aspect of the natural evolutionary process but also serves as a critical component in our quest for computational excellence.For those of us who bridge disparate fields like biology and finance, the application of genetic optimization to algorithmic trading is more than just a technical achievement. It’s an exciting symbiosis of natural wisdom and artificial intelligence, and a potent reminder that in the world of AI, the possibilities are as limitless as evolution itself.&lt;/p&gt;

In the USA, do retirees tend to buy an annuity or do they tend to leave their money invested and encash parts of the investments at regular intervals to generate a retirement income?

I am a new investor. I have only been studying investing for a couple months now. I’m 30m for reference. I invest currently in VOO and VXUS with an 80/20 split through Robinhood. I am going to continue to do this for my retirement (as my current job doesn’t offer a company 401k). 

However, I want to dabble in a little trading that will net a decent return in the short term, which I plan to reinvest in my VOO and VXUS. 

MGM was at $50.77 per share on July 1st of this year. Then came those cyber attacks, which have rightfully made people nervous and as a result (at least in my mind), the stock closed today at $36.54 per share. 

With football in season and the rise of sports betting, I believe this stock will recover at least a little bit, particularly since this mess with the cyber attack has been resolved and slowly, people may start feeling more confident patronizing an MGM establishment again. 

Not saying I would hold this one long term, and while it hit its all time high back in 2007, am I wrong in thinking there is still a bit of money to be made investing a couple grand into this stock and holding till it hits $50 or so again and selling it?

I am a 28F and hired a FA after graduating medical school. After our second meeting, he proposed starting an IUL with 6 figures (I've acquired money from an inheritance). After initial meeting, I was happy with the decision until I received the paperwork. It could've been written in another language for all I know, because it was 52 pages long of terms I've never heard of. 

I got cold feet and ghosted my FA, asking for a couple months because something seemed off. The pitch he gave me was the IUL was too good to be true and that's what set off alarms in my head. If this was so great, why weren't more people doing it? Why is it legal? How is the company keeping any money if they have allocate millions for death benefits?

We took a couple months break and reconvened a few days ago. I told him no to the IUL, but he spent another hour pushing me to do it, but recommending we do less money. I am put off by the persistent texts, emails, ""this is time sensitive, so get it back to me in 2 days"" knowing it was 52 pages long and I have no idea what I'm reading.

He said if the insurance company doesn't return with a great rate for me, we won't go through with it. However, I still feel like I'm being duped.

Please let me know your advice because my gut is telling me to run. How would you handle this situation?

Thanks so much.

Thanks for all of the replies! I am most likely not going through with the IUL since I've had bad feelings about it since it was introduced.

I don’t have any sort of financial mentor in my life so I’m looking for some insight, suggestions, opinions, etc. 

Here’s my current situation:

Wife and I together make $86,000 after taxes and health insurance. We budget our money with the 50/30/20 method and are now saving $1,400 a month. I had a job change this year and was unemployed for a bit, which caused us to drain our savings. We now have $3,400 in a HYSA (4.5%) and that’s where the $1,400/month will be going. 

I have a 403b from my old job that I plan on rolling over into my new job’s retirement option. I’ll be eligible for that in January. That’s at $37,000. I plan on contributing 6% once I’m enrolled in new retirement. 


Current debts: 
- Mortgage ($108,000 paying $725/month)
- Car ($10,200 paying $726/month)
- Home repair ($12,000 paying $190/month)

No CC debt or student loans

We are individually making more money than we’ve ever made before and want to capitalize on that. Priority #1 is to build at least 6 months expenses for an emergency fund. We are also looking to sell our home in the next 3-4 years. Beyond this, what would you do? What should we prioritize? Like I said we want to maximize our current situation and set ourselves up in the future.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have any sort of financial mentor in my life so I’m looking for some insight, suggestions, opinions, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my current situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wife and I together make $86,000 after taxes and health insurance. We budget our money with the 50/30/20 method and are now saving $1,400 a month. I had a job change this year and was unemployed for a bit, which caused us to drain our savings. We now have $3,400 in a HYSA (4.5%) and that’s where the $1,400/month will be going. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a 403b from my old job that I plan on rolling over into my new job’s retirement option. I’ll be eligible for that in January. That’s at $37,000. I plan on contributing 6% once I’m enrolled in new retirement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current debts: 
- Mortgage ($108,000 paying $725/month)
- Car ($10,200 paying $726/month)
- Home repair ($12,000 paying $190/month)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No CC debt or student loans&lt;/p&gt;

351,investing,"You’ve probably heard that coal is bad for the environment and the economy. That investing in coal is like throwing your money into a pit of fire. That coal is a dying industry that has no future.

But what if I told you that there are still some reasons to consider investing in coal? That coal might not be as doomed as you think? That coal could actually offer some opportunities that other sectors don’t?

Before you downvote me to oblivion, hear me out. In this post, I’ll explain why investing in coal might still be a smart move, despite the stigma and the challenges.

**Why the Stigma?**

Let’s start with the obvious: coal is one of the dirtiest sources of energy. Coal-fired power plants emit huge amounts of air pollutants and greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change and health problems. Coal mining also damages the environment and endangers the lives of workers.

That’s why there’s been a global shift toward renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro. These sources are cleaner, cheaper, and more sustainable than coal. They also align with the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria that many investors look for.

**Economic Reality**

But here’s the thing: coal still accounts for about 27% of the world’s total energy supply. And in some regions, especially in emerging markets and less developed countries, coal is still the main source of electricity. Why? Because coal is cheap, abundant, and reliable. It can provide a lot of energy with a small amount of fuel.

As the world population grows and more people need access to electricity, the demand for energy will increase. And while renewables are the future, they may not be able to meet this demand fast enough. Renewables depend on weather conditions and storage capacity, which can limit their availability and scalability.

That’s where coal comes in. Coal can fill the gap between the current and future energy needs. Coal can provide a steady and consistent supply of electricity, regardless of weather or time of day. Coal can also support the development of other industries that require a lot of energy, such as manufacturing and mining.

**Hedge Against Volatility**

Another reason to invest in coal is that it could serve as a hedge against market volatility. With everyone jumping on the renewable energy bandwagon, these markets could become oversaturated and unstable. The prices of renewable energy stocks could fluctuate wildly due to supply and demand imbalances, technological disruptions, or regulatory changes.

Coal, on the other hand, is an unpopular and undervalued sector. There’s less speculation and hype around coal stocks, which could make them more stable and predictable. Investing in coal could help you diversify your portfolio and reduce your exposure to risk.

**Technological Advancements**

You might think that coal is an old-fashioned and outdated technology that has no room for improvement. But that’s not true. There are actually some innovations happening in the coal sector that aim to make it cleaner and more efficient.

One example is carbon capture and storage (CCS), which is a process that captures CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants and stores them underground or in other locations. This way, CO2 doesn’t enter the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. CCS is not perfect, but it’s a step forward in reducing the environmental impact of coal.

Another example is high-efficiency low-emissions (HELE) coal technologies, which use advanced boilers and turbines to burn coal more efficiently and produce less emissions. HELE coal technologies can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 35% compared to conventional coal plants.

By investing in coal today, you could be indirectly investing in the future of cleaner fossil fuel technologies. You could be supporting the research and development of solutions that could make coal more compatible with environmental goals.

**Dividends and Valuations**

Finally, one of the most attractive reasons to invest in coal is that it offers high dividends and low valuations. Because coal stocks are unpopular and underappreciated, many of them are trading at low prices relative to their earnings and assets. This means that you could buy them at a bargain and potentially sell them at a profit later.

Moreover, many coal companies pay generous dividends to their shareholders as a way to reward them for their loyalty and patience. Dividends are regular payments that companies make from their profits to their investors. Dividends can provide you with a steady income stream and boost your returns over time.

For long-term investors who are looking for value and income opportunities, coal stocks could be a good option.

**The Risk Factor**

Of course, investing in coal is not without its risks. There are many factors that could affect the performance of the coal sector, such as:

Regulatory changes: Governments could impose stricter environmental regulations or carbon taxes on coal producers or consumers, which could increase their costs and reduce their profits.

Environmental activism: Environmental groups could pressure coal companies or their customers to switch to cleaner energy sources, which could reduce their demand and market share.

Renewable energy growth: Renewable energy sources could become more competitive and widespread, which could lower the price and demand for coal.

Coal supply and demand: Coal prices and production could vary depending on the availability and quality of coal reserves, as well as the global and regional demand for coal.

These risks are real and significant, and you should not ignore them. However, they are not unique to coal. Every sector has its own risks and challenges, and you should always do your own research and analysis before making any investment decisions.

**Conclusion**

Investing in coal is not a popular idea, but it might not be a bad one either. There are still some reasons to consider investing in this sector, such as:

Meeting the immediate global energy demand

Hedging against market volatility

Benefiting from technological advancements

Enjoying high dividends and low valuations

Investing in coal is not for everyone, and it’s not without its risks. But if you’re looking for an unpopular opinion that could pay off in the long run, you might want to give coal a second chance.

Here’s what I have at the moment:

$12k in checking account
$10k in 401k (haven’t been contributing but I am maxing it out this year and should have ~$28k by the end of the year) 
$20k in Roth IRA 
$103k in individual brokerage 

Much of my holdings have been in ARK ETFs (I know this was an awful decision, but I was young and made some poor choices). 

I’m wanting to exit those losing positions hopefully soon and sort out how else to allocate those funds. I will probably have the Roth IRA managed by my retirement company once I exit those positions so I don’t have to worry about it. I’ll also be getting quite the tax harvest from the selling the positions in my brokerage account. 

With all the losing positions I sell in my brokerage, I’ll have ~40k of cash to do whatever with. The other ~$63k is invested in TSLA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, AMD &amp; AMZN. I have a $30k position in TSLA, so that’s most of it. 

I’m thinking about taking the $40k I get from my losses and putting it in a HYSA, but not sure that would be the best thing to do. I think it would certainly be much less stressful than investing over $100k myself, but I also don’t think I’ll need the money very soon. 

I’m single and currently live in Denver (I hate it here), and would love to be able to go to a warmer place, potentially San Diego if I can afford it. I don’t know much about buying a house nor do I feel confident enough in a city to buy one, so still renting for now. My rent is 2.3k here, and would be much higher in a place like SD. I’m hoping to get a decent raise soon that would be closer to $200k, but not sure if it’s gonna play out yet or not. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Please be gentle because I know ARK was a mistake and I’m trying to do the right things now.

&lt;p&gt;$12k in checking account
$10k in 401k (haven’t been contributing but I am maxing it out this year and should have ~$28k by the end of the year) 
$20k in Roth IRA 
$103k in individual brokerage &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of my holdings have been in ARK ETFs (I know this was an awful decision, but I was young and made some poor choices). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m wanting to exit those losing positions hopefully soon and sort out how else to allocate those funds. I will probably have the Roth IRA managed by my retirement company once I exit those positions so I don’t have to worry about it. I’ll also be getting quite the tax harvest from the selling the positions in my brokerage account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the losing positions I sell in my brokerage, I’ll have ~40k of cash to do whatever with. The other ~$63k is invested in TSLA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, AMD &amp;amp; AMZN. I have a $30k position in TSLA, so that’s most of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking about taking the $40k I get from my losses and putting it in a HYSA, but not sure that would be the best thing to do. I think it would certainly be much less stressful than investing over $100k myself, but I also don’t think I’ll need the money very soon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m single and currently live in Denver (I hate it here), and would love to be able to go to a warmer place, potentially San Diego if I can afford it. I don’t know much about buying a house nor do I feel confident enough in a city to buy one, so still renting for now. My rent is 2.3k here, and would be much higher in a place like SD. I’m hoping to get a decent raise soon that would be closer to $200k, but not sure if it’s gonna play out yet or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Please be gentle because I know ARK was a mistake and I’m trying to do the right things now. I’m trying to get out of the mindset of recovering my losses through investments, and would like to be able to live more peacefully and not check the market every day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

359,investing,"Hi Folks,

I'm having a bit of trouble wrapping my mind around a financial concept, and I would be extremely appreciate of any insight some of you might be able to offer.   


I'll do my best to explain the situation to you in a concise way. Here it goes:  


I'm trying to determine how much to invest each period in a long-term hold strategy. Specifically, I'm trying to make guesses with a time value of money calculator as to how much my investment will be worth in a few decades. For this example, I assume I'll receive 10% back on my investment per year (on average over many years) before inflation is accounted for. I'll also assume that inflation is 3% on average, per year. I have been viewing my investments as making 7% to account for the 3% inflation in my example. 

However, if I am letting money sit for a long period of time (let's say 30 years), and I invest $2,000 each month at the beginning of the period, it doesn't take long before the interest earned on the principle of my investment will far outpace my expected monthly cash outflows in my overall personal budget, adjusted for inflation.  


Does it seem proper to look at my investment as much x% rate of return - y% rate of inflation? I ask because what boggles my mind is the point where my investments earn more interest in a period than I plan to spend in that same period. I understand the idea that inflation will make a dollar in the future less valuable than a dollar today), but for some reason, I can't help but think that I might be missing a key concept about rate of return vs. inflation  since at some point, the inflation on my monthly consumptions won't keep pace with the interest earned on a large enough principal balance (inflation adjusted).  


I hope that this makes sense. I have an accounting background, and I should know the answer to this, but I don't and  it's been gnawing at me for awhile. Maybe there is a term for what I'm trying to ask about, or maybe I have a poor understanding of time value of money and I'm looking at this problem incorrectly.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to know if anyone can help? I promise to pay it forward. Thank you for any insight that you can provide!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Folks,&lt;/p&gt;

371,investing,"Hi all, slightly unique situation here and would love to take in some general opinions or advice

In may 2021 I purchased a $700,000 townhouse with my roommate at a 3.5% interest rate. We planned to stay together for two years and then rent out the house as we go our separate ways while retaining 50/50 ownership. The time has come to make a decision. 

We are exploring property management company options, but between all the costs (management fee, pmi, mortgage, etc.), we will still be in the red by about $800 total (or $400 each) every month. Making some very generous assumptions (5% annual rent increase, consistent tenants, minimal repairs) we’ll be cash flow positive in about 5 years. 

We are both in comfortable positions career and life wise, and can reasonably expect stable jobs, full contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, full emergency funds, and enough to spend living enjoyable lives otherwise. 

The final factor is selling to OpenDoor, whose initial offer estimate is 832,000, but could be up to $885,000. In a best case scenario, selling to opendoor would net us both about $100,000, not factoring in what we’ve paid into the house so far. Zillow estimates our house at about $750,000, for reference, which I personally think is a far more reasonable assessment. 
 
So, the question comes down too if the monthly “investment” into the house will give greater returns than elsewhere, like S&amp;P. Not to mention we both need to agree on the same course of action. 

I’m inclined to keep the house as a form of diversification, but would appreciate input and thoughts from y’all, such as any experience selling to OpenDoor, co-owning a property with a friend, or any other of the unique investment choices I’m currently facing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, slightly unique situation here and would love to take in some general opinions or advice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the question comes down too if the monthly “investment” into the house will give greater returns than elsewhere, like S&amp;amp;P. Not to mention we both need to agree on the same course of action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m inclined to keep the house as a form of diversification, but would appreciate input and thoughts from y’all, such as any experience selling to OpenDoor, co-owning a property with a friend, or any other of the unique investment choices I’m currently facing.&lt;/p&gt;

372,investing,"Hi everyone,

I have a slight issue with understanding how the MIRR function behaves. I have read this [very useful paper](http://homepages.rpi.edu/~guptaa/MGMT2320/Handouts/ModifiedIRR.pdf) advocating the use of MIRR instead of IRR, but unless I am mistaken there is one weakness of the MIRR function that is not reflected.

From what I understand, and this is confirmed by manually doing the math, the MIRR function discounts investment outlays at a hurdle rate, compounds cashflows at an reinvestment rate (usually the WACC) and finds the IRR that makes the sum of the discounted investment outlays and the compounded cashflows equal to zero (this is the MIRR). Thus far, all good.

What I have a problem with is the behaviour of the function with the hurdle rate applied to future investment outlays. Consider this stream of cashflows: **year 0.** $(1,000,000); **year 1.** $500,000; **year 2.** $500,000; **year 3.** $550,000 and **year 4.** $(300,000). 

With a 10% WACC (ie, reinvest rate), the *MIRR* sensitivity to the **hurdle rate** is thus: **15%** - *12.5%*; **20%** - *13.1%*; **25%** - *13.7%*. The higher the perceived risk of the investment, the higher the MIRR because the investment outlay in year 4 is more discounted. Is this not problematic? If I deem a project riskier than usual, I should apply a higher hurdle rate, but this would yield a higher MIRR, leading me to prefer this project rather than another, less risky, just because distant investment outlays are more discounted. This is not intuitive to me and I would be happy to read your views on this. Many thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

Due to some weird fluke of circumstances, some of these assets, I am told, cannot be transferred via an inherited IRA and must be sent as cash only.  

What happened was parent 1 died, parent 2 died 5 months later but never claimed parent 1s assets.  So I had to make an estate and lay claim to them.  I had no issue getting inherited IRA from parent 2 assets.

&lt;p&gt;I’d really like to sell and invest the 175,000 for the future.  Would I not be able to safely make decent money on that lump sum? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work full time and this will not change my earning/spending either way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Sorry in advance on formatting, I’m writing this on my phone. 

My wife (28F) and I (35M) are going to be diversifying from apple and would love your opinions. I will give a brief background about us and also our financial situation. 

My wife is finishing her masters program in the spring of 24 and will be making about 100k a year. She will have about 70k in student debt. I am in tech and earn about 175-250k with zero debt. We have 1 daughter who is 3 years old. We live in a HCOL area in Northern California and fortunately have a paid off residence. 

The allocations below are held in a trust which took a 90k loss last year and gives us the opportunity to reduce allocation % in apple. Essentially we will be selling 90,000 in capital gains (roughly 690+ shares) and diversifying. 

(Trust)
Apple shares - 3,250 ($572,975)
Shwab CD - $125,000 (4.1% &amp; expiring in October 2023) 
Cash - 14.5k

Personal brokerage 
Apple shares - 620 ($109,306)
Nvidia shares - 15 ($6,720
Tesla - 10 ($2,670)
529 account - ($4,000)
VTI - $22,420 (Roth ira)
401k - $101,000 (VTSAX)
Cash - 35k

Our Schwab advisor is pushing for a self directed index through Schwab. The Schwab advisor  wants us to harvest losses in the future so we can diversify apple to even out the allocations. Minimum investment amount is 100k into this self directed index fund. Our longLong term goal is wanting to have a 10-15% allocation in apple. 

My question to the group is, what should my next step be? I’m a little skeptical about a self directed index fund because it’s a Schwab robo advisor with .4% fees. Should i just sell 75% of the entire trust and VTI or VOO it? We are very fortunate to be in this situation but are losing sleep at night with everything in 1 stock.

455,investing,"I am a large holder in $sq and have never seen such an improving business with such a dissociated stock price. 

When $sq was $52 in 2018, it’s revenue was $750m a quarter, or $3b a year. It has since 8xed it’s revenue, and is now doing $5.5b a quarter (2x it’s YEARLY REVENUE in 2018) or $22b revenue a year. Same exact stock price, dropping lower as we speak and hitting new 52 week lows.

This would be somewhat reasonable if SQ was showing negative growth (even then it wouldn’t be justified) but here’s why I think it should be a lot higher. 

1.) BTC in 2018 was $3.3k, cashapp has been offering BTC sales since Jan. 2018, today the price is $27k, so an 8x increase. This doesn’t even include the amount of users they’ve grown using the service.

2.) BNPL is on fire. As the recessions looms consumers are taking on debt to fuel their habits, great for Square’s afterpay and afterpay is hitting new revenue highs. Affirms stock price is crushing it while square slips to new lows.

3.) Monster Cash-app growth. In 2018, Square’s Cash-app was doing 400M in revenue a year, it is now doing 12 BILLION a year in revenue, with 3B of that being GROSS PROFIT. A 30X or 3000% revenue increase! 

4.) Square Terminals: In 2018, Square terminal revenue was $300m a year. Today, it’s 1.5-1.7b. A 500-600% increase 

5.) Unlike other growth stocks, it did not grow off the hands of the pandemic. An example of this would be Fiverr or Etsy, clearly it’s growth stems from people trying to make money at home. Squares growth is organic, while a lot of other growth stocks are superficial.

6.) As the recession looms, consumers will slowly flock away from everything that damages their wealth. With cashapp you can send money and not have to worry about chargebacks (like PayPal) and it’s completely free. 

Before anyone comments, I know the company has diluted shareholders but every company does this and when you configure it into actual percentages it’s a lot lower than other companies since the market cap of $sq is so high.

Tl;Dr Since 2018, Squares stock price has been the same but all biggest lines of it’s business have improved revenue between 400-4000%. 


There has to be a reason it’s constantly underperforming and hitting 52 week lows today. There is little to no short interest on the stock so people selling it are actually pressing the button. There’s no public info that I can find for it to be doing this badly. Other people are happily willing to sell at this price, so it’s making me think there’s something wallstreet knows that I don’t. Can anyone tell me why this stock may be a trap?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a large holder in $sq and have never seen such an improving business with such a dissociated stock price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When $sq was $52 in 2018, it’s revenue was $750m a quarter, or $3b a year. It has since 8xed it’s revenue, and is now doing $5.5b a quarter (2x it’s YEARLY REVENUE in 2018) or $22b revenue a year. Same exact stock price, dropping lower as we speak and hitting new 52 week lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be somewhat reasonable if SQ was showing negative growth (even then it wouldn’t be justified) but here’s why I think it should be a lot higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) BTC in 2018 was $3.3k, cashapp has been offering BTC sales since Jan. 2018, today the price is $27k, so an 8x increase. This doesn’t even include the amount of users they’ve grown using the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) BNPL is on fire. As the recessions looms consumers are taking on debt to fuel their habits, great for Square’s afterpay and afterpay is hitting new revenue highs. Affirms stock price is crushing it while square slips to new lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.) Monster Cash-app growth. In 2018, Square’s Cash-app was doing 400M in revenue a year, it is now doing 12 BILLION a year in revenue, with 3B of that being GROSS PROFIT. A 30X or 3000% revenue increase! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.) Square Terminals: In 2018, Square terminal revenue was $300m a year. Today, it’s 1.5-1.7b. A 500-600% increase &lt;/p&gt;

Strong core inflation, higher energy prices combined with resilient consumer demand and a still strong labor market means the Fed will most likely hike further in coming months. It's also expected that the Fed will raise their 2024/2025 dot plot chart outlining more hikes.

I'll have 600k in taxable brokerage that I need to last 15-20 years at a fixed $30k inflation adjusted withdrawal rate. I understand this is larger than the recommended 4%, but after 20 years then I can pull from some of my tax advantage accounts where I'll be at a safer withdrawal rate. I also plan to Roth IRA convert in this period of low taxation and if SHTF I can always go back to work as well, which is why I am taking this risk.

Ideally I'd like to avoid early withdrawal penalties on my tax advantaged accounts, but in order to do that I need to hedge against sequence of returns risk while also still allowing enough growth to support a 5% withdrawal.

My plan; **65% VOO, 10% AVUV, 25% BND**.

**No international?**

I do not think the US will under-performed the international market - opinions can be adjusted if I see it fit.

**Why large cap?**

I invested heavy into VOO and I can't just convert it to VTI and pay the capital gains taxes, nor do I think VTI vs VOO is that much different. I think medium and small cap add volatility and I'd like to have more control over that.

**Why small cap value?**

I think with the high CAPE ratio, I am forecasting may see a period where value stocks outperforms growth like in years before the latest bull market, which is why I wanted some value.; so that is where AVUV (small cap value) comes in where I pick up small cap and I add some value to help with sequence-of-returns, this also helps my portfolio get away from being so tech heavy (VOO) and more into finance where I think there is value but also growth potential.

**Why 25% bonds?**

Monte carlo suggest this much bond allocation is ideal for my needs of needing a 5% withdrawal but hedging sequence of returns.

When/if the market is down in the early years I plan to sell BND for more VOO to ride the uptick when it eventually comes.

482,investing,"Coke or Pepsi? These two companies have dominated the soft drinks industry for over a century. Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. A famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that some argue they have shaped modern marketing. Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, it's hard to say that today. Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.

So, which company is the better investment choice? We all know that Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, making up almost 7% of his portfolio. Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead? 

[Historically, Pepsi's total return has been higher than Coca Cola's.](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) That's been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let's take a look at the latest earnings. 

# Latest Earnings

At the end of July, [Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%,](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. Meanwhile, [Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6% and revenue estimates by 2.7%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi's stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then. 

# Valuation Metrics

Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. [Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), whereas [Pepsi stands at 24](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke's 9.6.

# Margins

The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. [Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) than [Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D)which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola's margins are more stable than Pepsi's, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that's a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.

# Capital Structure

The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of \~$250B and debts of \~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B).

However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke's $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it's nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.

Since that's the case, let's look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. [Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi's outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, [Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi's stock price has been doing better than Coke. 

# Dividends 

Coke does have a [better dividend of 3.2%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that's not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don't see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there's just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster. 

That's exactly what we see with Pepsi. [Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), that's true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke's at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list. Pepsi's payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don't think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%.

At this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but they are almost identical. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it's raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.

# Technical Analysis

Now, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can't really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi's price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn't closed below it. I think that's a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn't been doing too well. It's down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola's price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we've see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola's price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.

# Price Targets

My personal valuation models put Coca Cola's fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that's somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. [The Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.

On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That's a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi's free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That's why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can't say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. [Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.

# Final Verdict

Now, what's the verdict here? To me, it looks like the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I'm not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don't have any positions in either of these and I don't think I'll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%.

That's my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?

**TLDR; Pepsi looks better technically, Coke has a better valuation, but neither are really at a good price point for new entrants.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke or Pepsi? These two companies have dominated the soft drinks industry for over a century. Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898.

Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, which company is the better investment choice? We all know that Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, making up almost 7% of his portfolio. Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead? &lt;/p&gt;

Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let&amp;#39;s take a look at the latest earnings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Latest Earnings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of July, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%,&lt;/a&gt; but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6% and revenue estimates by 2.7%&lt;/a&gt; while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi&amp;#39;s stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Valuation Metrics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22&lt;/a&gt;, whereas &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi stands at 24&lt;/a&gt;. However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke&amp;#39;s 9.6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Margins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi&lt;/a&gt;which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola&amp;#39;s margins are more stable than Pepsi&amp;#39;s, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that&amp;#39;s a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Capital Structure&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of ~$250B and debts of ~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke&amp;#39;s $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it&amp;#39;s nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that&amp;#39;s the case, let&amp;#39;s look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases&lt;/a&gt; (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi&amp;#39;s outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares&lt;/a&gt;. Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi&amp;#39;s stock price has been doing better than Coke. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dividends&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coke does have a &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;better dividend of 3.2%&lt;/a&gt;. Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that&amp;#39;s not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don&amp;#39;t see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there&amp;#39;s just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s exactly what we see with Pepsi. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;#39;s true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke&amp;#39;s at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list. Pepsi&amp;#39;s payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don&amp;#39;t think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but they are almost identical. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it&amp;#39;s raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Technical Analysis&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can&amp;#39;t really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi&amp;#39;s price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn&amp;#39;t closed below it. I think that&amp;#39;s a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn&amp;#39;t been doing too well. It&amp;#39;s down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola&amp;#39;s price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we&amp;#39;ve see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola&amp;#39;s price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Price Targets&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal valuation models put Coca Cola&amp;#39;s fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that&amp;#39;s somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;The Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars&lt;/a&gt; and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That&amp;#39;s a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi&amp;#39;s free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That&amp;#39;s why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can&amp;#39;t say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi&lt;/a&gt; with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Final Verdict&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what&amp;#39;s the verdict here? To me, it looks like the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I&amp;#39;m not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don&amp;#39;t have any positions in either of these and I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR; Pepsi looks better technically, Coke has a better valuation, but neither are really at a good price point for new entrants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Basically I was making the case that stocks were a good deal even though they appeared overpriced based on the CAPE index since bonds and gold were much more overpriced. 

Here’s how the predictions turned out.

Prediction: Stocks are not overpriced on a relative basis/still a good investment:

Result: Nasdaq has averaged around an +8.1% annually in the past 3 years

Prediction: Gold is not a good investment because of the historically high gold to platinum ratio at the time.

Results: Gold returned -5.9% annually

Prediction: Bonds are overpriced / not a good investment

Results: Bonds have been the biggest loser in the past 3 years. Not sure exactly what metric to show on this but in 2022 alone 30 year US treasuries lost 39.2% of their market value.  The total bond index lost 13% in 2022.

Here’s a good reference index: Vanguard total bond market index VBMFX  annual return -7.1%

Overall: pretty accurate!  Just wish I zeroed in more on real estate as the winning option!

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the predictions turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prediction: Stocks are not overpriced on a relative basis/still a good investment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Result: Nasdaq has averaged around an +8.1% annually in the past 3 years&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prediction: Gold is not a good investment because of the historically high gold to platinum ratio at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results: Gold returned -5.9% annually&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prediction: Bonds are overpriced / not a good investment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results: Bonds have been the biggest loser in the past 3 years. Not sure exactly what metric to show on this but in 2022 alone 30 year US treasuries lost 39.2% of their market value.  The total bond index lost 13% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a good reference index: Vanguard total bond market index VBMFX  annual return -7.1%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall: pretty accurate!  Just wish I zeroed in more on real estate as the winning option!&lt;/p&gt;

But as I started to learn more and more about investing, I got introduced to factor investing and tilting and realised after learning that a small cap value tilt might actually be better than the initial percentage division I had. However, I do understand that many YouTubers/finance experts online advocate more for the large cap growth as an agressive mode of investment than a small proportion of them advocating small cap value. 


I'm just curious if my thought process in this decision makes sense: I buy 40% VOO as a broad index. I buy 10% Large cap growth in order to not miss out on the performance gains right now in the market. I buy 15% small and mid cap for slight tilt and 15% small cap value tilt as they perform the best in long term according to theory. The remaining 20 I use it for international with 10% of it for emerging and 10% of it for developed ex US. 


This way I'm thinking I could get exposure to what's in the peak right now(large cap growth) and use a best theoretical performer(small caps and small cap value) and also diversify with international so during us recession my portfolio doesn't go to 0. 


Btw, I have specifically avoided large value also because they have more dividend advantage which I cannot fully grasp being in a non US country which taxes dividends. Searching small cap growth has just given me bad results all over the internet so I'm skeptical of that too.

510,investing,"A) Okay so I just wanted some clarifications: The shares that we are buying on any exchange have already been sold by a company that went public during their IPO. That means the company has already benefited when they originally issued out their shares. So when we buy and trade shares, through index funds (ETFs), we're trading on a secondary market. 

B) When you buy index fund ETFs such as XEQT, VEQT you buy an index fund that tracks a specific market. So if you own 1 share of VEQT, does the cost of that one share get allocated based on the weight of all the aggregate holdings within the index fund? Or are you investing in just the market itself and the share price of VEQT does not translate to equity in the holdings?

I’m in my mid 20s, and I’ve been investing for 2.5ish years. I began to run into investing subreddits recently and have become aware that I’m missing the mark with a lot of what I’m doing. I’m only looking for long term investing advice. I have questions and would appreciate any help you provide. Here is where I’m at…

- Schwab Intelligent Portfolio
    - 70% stocks (FNDX, SCHX, FNDE, FNDA, FNDF, VOO, etc), 20% fixed income (SCHI, VMBS, SCHR, etc), 2% commodities (IAU), 8% cash
    - Do I just pull out of this portfolio? I’ve heard plenty of redditors mention it’s holding you back because of the cash percentage. Also, I don’t believe it’s the best investment strategy long term. If I do pull out and sell my investments here, while I’m at a loss, do I get taxed still? Not entirely sure how selling works because I haven’t sold anything since I started

- Schwab Personal Brokerage
    - Started this before the intelligent portfolio, and I still have some investments here. Ironically, this portfolio has consistently been doing better than the intelligent one.

- Roth IRA
    - Started investing into my Roth IRA this year. I don’t quite think I’ll max it out this year, but my plan is to do so going forward. I made the mistake of not understanding it, and it hasn’t been invested into anything since I began it months ago.
    - What do I invest my money here in? VTI/VOO? Something else? Also, am I allowed to transfer money from my brokerage accounts to my Roth IRA? I can probably max this year if I do that. 

- 401k
    - invested all in Vanguard target 2060. Should I keep this or change what I’m doing?
    - I will not max this either, but I will maybe increase my contributions to it going forward

- Regular savings account
    - Have saved about 5-6 months worth of expenses in case of emergency

I probably have 4% of my money in Roth IRA, 47% in brokerage accounts, 31% in 401k, 18% in savings account. I have a feeling I’m not doing this well, and I would appreciate more experienced investors to help me get on the right track.

I’m in my 20s and I understand the power of compounding interest and aim to invest in S&amp;P for the remainder of my working career.

I’m in the UK and currently invest each month in an investment ISA with Hargreaves Lansdown.

My question is - is there any merit in having investment ISAs at several company’s e.g. having another ISA open with vanguard. 

Is there any dangers with investing exclusively with one company? Is there any better way to do it?

I can't make 10,000 trades/sec the instant that news is released. I've realized this a lot more this year, I'm a software developer and I started working at a financial company so I've gotten a taste of what that looks like.

So what advantages do us individual investors have? I've thought of a few, and would be interested in hearing any other considerations.

* Lower position sizing - Don't need to invest $50 mil per trade, so can invest in smaller companies that large institutions wouldn't bother with.
* No bureaucracy - This doesn't apply to HFT systems, but you don't have to get approval and can move more quickly in some cases or react to events.
* Personal Experience - You can invest in what you know or have knowledge about from your day-to-day life that others may not have.

546,investing,"I have a good job.  I make about $125k a year but invest about $20k - $30k+ of that money every year.  So I probably live on $95k or less.

I've been doing this a long time and have a substantial retirement portfolio built up in an IRA.

There is some potential (maybe 50/50) that my company will lay me off inside a year.  If I have to find a new job at this time, I will likely take a pay cut, and/or have to move to a new place.  Potentially forfeiting the 2.875% mortgage on my current house and trying to buy a new house in this insane market.

On the other hand. . .

If I invest aggressively, I could generate maybe $200k+ per year in income off the portfolio.  Some back of the envelope math says I could:

* Take out $150k per year
* Pay taxes and penalties on this withdrawal that would leave me with maybe $115k after everything
* Reinvest the other $50k into more conservative investments.
* By the time I'm actually old enough to withdraw from the account, I'd have more than $1M in conservative investments built up (assuming an 8%) rate of return.  Plus I'd have my original portfolio balance.
* I also have a pension worth about $2k a month if I take it at 57, or $3k if I wait until 62
* Social security will take a substantial hit since I'm skipping a decade+ of my most profitable working years.

Pros I see:

* I can retire at 47
* I'll have a substantial and growing retirement fund until I hit normal retirement age
* If I get laid off I don't have to sweat taking another job, possibly at a paycut and uprooting my life if I have to move

Cons I see

* There's some risk here . .  the income could drop, the value of my investments could drop.  I wouldn't lose everything, but could easily take a 20% haircut.  I see the chance of this happening as low.Also, with each passing years that goes ok, my conservative investments build, reducing the risk.  I think the biggest risk to this strategy is in the first 3 years.

If something drastic happened, I cal always go back to work, although, as noted, I'll probably take a paycut.  I have some other retirement accounts I wouldn't touch either.  As a backstop as well.

* That's a lot of money to hand over to the government in taxes (which I'd have to pay eventually anyway) and penalties (which I'm choosing to eat in exchange for not having to work for a living a decade+ early.)
* My social security would take a substantial hit from missing my most profitable years of working
* My wife works, makes about $65k, and would want to retire also.  But for various reasons this could be ok if it didn't happen for another couple years.  However, she would walk away from a pension of about $25k per year if she retires before another 6 years.  She wouldn't want to wait.

This is only a potential fall-back plan.  If my employer doesn't lay me off, I'm happy to continue working.

But if they do. . .I'm seriously considering trying this and just checking out of the workforce.

""The European Central Bank on Thursday announced a 10th consecutive hike in its main interest rate, as the fight against inflation took precedence over a weakening economy.

The unprecedented series of rate rises has now hauled the central bank’s deposit facility from -0.5% in June 2022 to a record 4%. **A key reason for the hike appeared to be upward revisions in newly-published staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which see inflation averaging at 5.6% this year, 3.2% next year and 2.1% in 2025.**""

Here are the main rates that got raised again:

\- ECB Interest Rate Decision (Sep): **4.50%**  (previous 4.25%)

\- ECB Marginal Lending Facility (Sep): **4.75%**  (previous 4.50%)

\- ECB Deposit Facility Rate (Sep): **4.00%**  (previous 3.75%)

While some seem to be thinking this will be the end of ECB hiking, we all know if new inflation data comes in higher than expected they will continue to hike.

You read that right! On August 24 (NZST), we successfully launched our 40th Electron mission, called “We Love the Nightlife,” for Capella Space. Not only did we deliver Capella’s satellite to orbit, but we also demonstrated some significant milestones in evolving Electron into a reusable rocket. 

  
For the first time, we reused a Rutherford engine that had previously flown on our “There And Back Again” mission in May 2022. The engine worked flawlessly on its second flight as it took Electron to space. Then the first stage returned to Earth with a successful ocean splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. 

  
Hot on the heels of “We Love the Nightlife,” we’re launching another dedicated Electron launch for Capella. The ‘We Will Never Desert You’ mission is scheduled for lift-off from Launch Complex 1 as soon as 19 September. The mission will be our third launch for Capella this year – we're on a roll!

**Rise &amp; Sign: New Launch Deals Signed!**   


  
There must have been something in the air in recent weeks because we’ve announced 14 new launch deals across our Electron and HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) programs.    
**Here’s a look at what’s to come:**   
New HASTE launch for an undisclosed customer to take place at Launch Complex 2 (LC-2) in Virginia in 2024. We successfully launched our first HASTE rocket in June for Leidos on a mission called Scout’s Arrow. Learn more about HASTE! (HASTE rocket) 

  
Four new HASTE missions for Leidos under the MACH-TB program, scheduled to launch from LC-2 across 2024 and 2025.  

  
BlackSky, a leading provider of real-time geospatial intelligence and global monitoring services, which has launched on six Electron missions since 2019, signed a block buy deal for five Electron launches for their Gen-3 satellites beginning in 2024. Fun fact: BlackSky has used Electron as a launch vehicle more than any other single commercial customer!    


  
A new, double-launch deal with NASA to deliver their climate change research-focused mission, PREFIRE, is now scheduled to launch in May 2024. NASA's PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) mission will help close a gap in understanding of how much of Earth’s heat is lost to space, especially from the Arctic and Antarctica. This will be our 7th and 8th mission for NASA since 2018. (Graphic we made of 2 launches)  

  
Last but not least, we signed a deal with Japanese Earth imaging company Synspective to launch two dedicated Electron missions. Rocket Lab has been launching for Synspective since 2020 when the Company deployed the first satellite in Synspective’s synthetic aperture radar (SAR) constellation. Since that first mission, Rocket Lab has been the sole launch provider for Synspective’s StriX constellation to date, successfully deploying three StriX satellites across three dedicated Electron launches

Rocket Lab received the prestigious Industry of the Year Award at the Hancock Chamber Business &amp; Industry Awards Gala in August. The annual awards recognize outstanding achievements in citizenship, industry and business in Hancock County, Mississippi.    
We opened our facility at the Stennis Space Center in 2022 and the site will be used to test the new Archimedes engines for the Neutron rocket coming in 2024.   
When we expanded our Space Systems division, we created a vertical integration strategy where we could build essential elements of a spacecraft for our own satellites and those built by others. The idea behind this was everything going to space should have a Rocket Lab logo on it!   
**Speaking of…  NASA Psyche Mission**    
NASA’s Psyche mission, which will orbit a metal-rich asteroid of the same name in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is scheduled to launch in less than 30 days on 5 October 2023!    
The spacecraft will use a huge Rocket Lab solar array that will power the spacecraft during its 4-billion-kilometer journey.

**MethaneSAT Mission**  

  
MethaneSAT, scheduled to launch no earlier than January 2024, is an Earth observation satellite that will monitor and study global methane emissions to combat climate change. We are providing multiple elements to make this mission a success including developing the Mission Operation Center, the solar panels to power the spacecraft, and the separation system that will eject the satellite to its orbit. This mission is jointly funded and operated by the Environmental Defense Fund, an American NGO, and the New Zealand Space Agency – the country’s first space science mission!    
**Neutron Update**  
Neutron, our mega constellation launcher, continues its development on schedule. We’ve now begun Stage 2 tank testing including cryogenic fill and pressure cycles to determine structural and sealing integrity and performance, hydrostat test to prove the structural integrity of the structure, domes, and hatches, and the fill, press, vent and de-tank systems and procedures among other structural tests.

I have a question when it comes to investing in stocks that pay out dividends quarterly. 

Do I have to have my money invested in the stock for a certain amount of time before I am eligible to receive dividends?

For example, if the stock is to pay a dividend at the end of December. Will I be eligible to get a dividend if I invest in the stock at the end of November?   
Also, what if I sell my shares after the dividend is paid and buy again the month before the next dividend is to be paid?   
Is that a valid strategy at all?

&lt;p&gt;For example, if the stock is to pay a dividend at the end of December. Will I be eligible to get a dividend if I invest in the stock at the end of November?&lt;br/&gt;
Also, what if I sell my shares after the dividend is paid and buy again the month before the next dividend is to be paid?&lt;br/&gt;
Is that a valid strategy at all? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks &lt;/p&gt;

I’m a 46yo living in Greenville, South Carolina. I’m married with 2 kids still at home (19yo and 14yo) and my 76yo mother who lives with us. 

I make $90k with ~$5k bonus yearly. My 401k is $30k and I very recently moved it all from a 2045 TDF to Fidelity’s Large Cap fund with future contributions going to their S&amp;P Index Fund. I contribute 15% with a 4% company match.

My wife makes $125k with ~$5k bonus yearly. Her 401k has $230k and is in a 2045 TDF. She contributes 15% with a 4% company match. 

My mom gets Medicare at $1.6k per month with a savings of $2000. She was not able to save anything throughout her life (that’s a different story). It’s going to be tough conversations if any big medical bills occur. So far she’s been able to cover her medical expenses. 

We have $16k in traditional savings, and $15k in a taxable brokerage account allocated like so:
VOO - 30%
QQQ - 25%
VUG - 25%
VB - 13.5%
VXUS - 6.5%

We owe $296k on our mortgage at 3.5%. Around $225k equity in the home. We owe $32k at 1.9% on our 2022 Honda Pilot and have a 2019 Honda Civic just paid off. 

We’re in the process of tightening up on frivolous spending and want to put as much money to work for us as hard as it possibly can. I don’t have a final number on what we can invest each month, but it is non-negative, probably $2k/month comfortably.

Firstly apologies, I am very recent into investing so it’s all a bit overwhelming with all the various options for funds to invest in.

I’ve just moved my Lifetime ISA from Moneybox to Trading212, but with further research I’m a bit worried I made a mistake. A lot of the advice I’ve seen for passive investing is to open a Vanguard account, put all my money in a FTSE Global All-Cap and sit on it. Is there an alternative in Trading 212 that I can put my money in and let it sit for 20+ years?

Or would the recommendation be to switch again?

Any help appreciated.

My biggest losers are Disney and Square, with a cost of $1750 and $1170 respectively with a total gain of -$670 and -$800.

I wanted to know if it would be best for me to cut my losses and use the money to pay off my credit card bills and my car or to keep holding in hopes the stocks can get back close to what they were once worth.

600,investing,"Here is my bullish case for gold:  


**Gold as a Store of Value**  
\- Fiat currency can be printed endlessly, but gold cannot.  
\- The quantity of gold on Earth is limited, and all the gold ever mined would fit into a 20-meter cube.  
\- The purchasing power of a gram of gold is more stable than that of a dollar, which tends to decrease over time.  
\- This means that during periods of high inflation, the price of gold tends to rise, even though it experiences cycles of ups and downs.  


**Gold as a Safe Haven**  
\- Central banks stockpile gold, even though currencies are no longer officially tied to gold, it remains an effective means of building trust in a currency.  
\- When the conflict in Ukraine started, investors rushed to buy gold, causing its price to rise.  
This was not the case for stocks, which plummeted, or for currencies, which also suffered.  
\- Notably, gold has risen during the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the subprime crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic.  
\- It's important to note that gold does not generate income, unlike stocks or real estate investments.  
\- Gold primarily serves as an insurance policy, particularly effective in countries with high political or economic instability (e.g., Turkey, Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina).  


**Gold for Portfolio Diversification**  
\- Gold is also an effective way to diversify a portfolio and decouple it from financial markets. When the stock market declines, the value of gold tends to rise.  
\- Owning gold can be an effective way to shield oneself from market downturns.  
However, it's important to note that gold can also be volatile.  


**How to Invest in Gold**  
\- Buying Physical Gold: The most straightforward method is to purchase gold in the form of bars or coins. Online platforms are often the most convenient option.  
\- Buying Paper Gold: Not my favorite method to invest in gold. You can buy an ETF that tracks the price of gold (e.g., iShares Physical Gold or WisdomTree Physical Gold). Some ETFs invest in baskets of shares of gold mining and exploration companies.

Caravelle International (CACO) is a Singaporean shipping company that is listed on the NASDAQ as a foreign private issuer. That is, they don't have to file quarterly reports nor current reports. They two business segments, namely traditional shipping and a new business segment that's set to take off at the end of 2023 - wood desiccation services.

Fundamentals are good and you're paying almost nothing for it. But that's not what's important. The new wood desiccation segment is built off of an apparently revolutionary technology that reuses the ocean liner's exhaust gases to dry green wood while in voyage. Normally, wood is dried in wood drying kilns on-shore for anywhere between 60-100 dollars per cubic metre and the whole process takes around 45 days. It is expensive, a hassle in terms of logistics, slow and emits a lot of waste gases. This new technology promises to solve all of that and generate additional revenue through the collection of wood vinegar from the drying process, besides requiring only a one-time capex to be fitted onto ships with no additional ship hands needed. It is the only thesis I have for this company.

Here are the big red flags:
1. The documentation for this technology is presented in a doctoral thesis written by Dr Zhang, the CEO and founder of CACO and submitted to Universite Paris-Dauphine in 2018, of which I am unable to verify nor can I verify that Dr Zhang did attain his PhD from said university.

To the wood and shipping experts here: is such a wood desiccation technology even feasible in the first place? I'm sure this idea has been considered before.

2. IR information on their website is completely wrong. The email domain does not exist and the phone number leads to the wrong person. I tried contacting the CEO directly but no news so far.

3. It's registered as an FPI and was formed as a result of a SPAC merger.

4. Next to no information can be found on this company anywhere besides the official website.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;IR information on their website is completely wrong. The email domain does not exist and the phone number leads to the wrong person. I tried contacting the CEO directly but no news so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s registered as an FPI and was formed as a result of a SPAC merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next to no information can be found on this company anywhere besides the official website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there something I missed here? Is this company really a scam as I am prepared to believe? I am new to these kinds of micro cap stocks so I would greatly appreciate any feedback on my analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

Objective is to day-trade in a tax sheltered account so that there are no consequences while day-trading is conducted within that tax sheltered account.

I checked, IRA, Roth IRA, 401K, it seems that all these have the requirement that any contribution in these have to come from annual income or a portion of it. The issue is there is no income this year or any previous years. Its only my savings I plan on putting in a tax sheltered account.

So with this conundrum, are there any tax sheltered accounts in which I can contribute from savings money and not income money ? Or should I set up a income from day trading / investing first, report it as income and then use that income to put it in tax sheltered accounts ? but then again I won't be able to put anymore than 6500$ of my income into these tax sheltered accounts. (can I use previous years of unused contribution so add up 6500 unused amounts from last several years ?) 

In Canada, there is a tax sheltered account called TFSA where you can contribute non-income savings money, was wondering if US has anything like it as well ?

20% Fidelity SPAXX that has interest rate of ~4.97% (i assume this is default for cash sitting in Fidelity brokerage account, please correct me if i am wrong)

My father, brother and I own a few rental properties between us, but are looking to invest more heavily in additional properties. We would like to form a partnership of sorts where we are all 1/3 owners. We are in the beginning stages of discussion, however, one of us will bring the majority of the funds at first and the other two will manage the properties.

A few questions regarding this approach:

\- Does the main financier need to be the sole person on the LLC?

\- Assuming all of the rent money will need to go back into the main financier's IRA?

\- If this assumption is correct, how do we break the properties out later on? Is this even possible?

Please note, we are planning to buy a few properties at first with the IRA cash and NOT take a profit outside of paying off the main financier with a mortgage ""loan"" amortization type schedule.

&lt;p&gt;I make between 70-75k a year plus company vehicle, pay 2000/month on rent currently where I moved to, and a mortgage where I moved from that’s 400 mo, but rents for 700mo.  &lt;/p&gt;

For regular convertible preferred stock I would think that upon conversion, the common stock owner saves the preferred dividend like a loan paid back, but loses ownership % due to a higher number of shares outstanding.

12yr backtest with the same ETFs from my portfolio:

It underperformed the SP500 over the last 3 years, probably because the recent crash in long term treasuries. But overall provided more consistent returns with a higher sharpe and smaller drawdowns.

Many of those ETFs aren't very correlated to each other, which reduces volatility.

The portfolio avoids real estate, financials and consumer discretionary because they are highly correlated with each other, and have been prone to bubble and burst cycles. Their returns are IMO less likely to be drastically improved by technology.

- VGT (technology) is high risk high return
- VDC (staples), VPU (utilities), VHT (healthcare) are more defensive
- VOX (communications) and VIS (industrials) are somewhere in between risk-wise. I still add them because they could be revolutionized further by VR/AR, social media, battery technology, robotics, superconductors, etc.
- VDE (energy) hedges against inflation and geopolitical risk.

636,investing,"In an interview on CNBC, investor Warren Buffett said the following: “In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending”. He didn't give the exact reason why this would happen. He just added: “When it happens or how or anything else, I don’t know”. Here we will give the exact reason by demonstrating one fundamental flaw that all cryptocurrencies have.

Cryptocurrencies are publicly portrayed as innovative payment systems. We constantly hear stories about their fancy features like speed, decentralization, security, immutability, and scarcity. And that these features somehow make them better or superior to the fiat payment system. But what we never hear, is that crypto systems cannot solve one fundamental problem. A problem that trumps all those fancy features. Now let's see what exactly that problem is.

In barter or commodity-based payment systems, both parties in an exchange receive either goods or services. If one traded tobacco for a haircut or a cow for gold, both parties received items that satisfy human wants and needs. However, in payment systems like fiat or crypto, there is a problem. Nemaley, only one party receives goods or services. The other party receives just system units. They receive something that cannot be used to satisfy human wants and needs. So obviously, the system that issued such units must be able to solve this problem. The fiat payment system solves it, while crypto does not. Let’s now demonstrate this.

The fiat payment system has two stages. In the first stage, the banks create the units by granting loans or purchasing government bonds. With such created units, loan or bond beneficiaries go to the market and get goods and services. So that stage is when the said problem is created. The market gives up items that can be used to satisfy wants and needs and gets only system units. The solution to this problem comes in the second stage. Namely, given that banks have loan contracts with the beneficiaries, liens on their properties and in the case of government bonds that must be repaid, this forces the beneficiaries to give goods and services back to the market. Otherwise, they would not be able to get the units to pay their debt, and they would face foreclosures on their properties. Additionally, the issued units are  recorded in the balance sheets of the banks as their liabilities. That means that if the beneficiaries default, the banks must sell foreclosed properties for the units to close the unpaid debt and in that way remove liabilities from their balance sheets. And that is how the problem is solved. That is how the market gets goods and services back.

In crypto systems, however, there is no solution to the problem. These systems have only the first stage. The market initially gets the units as trades for electricity needed to maintain the systems. Electricity is a good that can satisfy a lot of needs and wants. But once the market traded that good for the units, and trades them further for other goods and services, these units are never withdrawn from the market. There is no debt-like mechanism with pledged collaterals to ensure regular withdrawal of the units from the market and the return of goods and services. Instead, the market is stuck with the units indefinitely, or at least until the systems collapse.

The creators of crypto systems create them to have all those fancy features that we mentioned at the beginning. From the outside, these features give the appearance of superiority to the fiat payment system. But none of that solves the said problem. In the long run, the market will reject payment systems with such a fundamental flaw. People will stop giving up goods, services, or fiat units that ensure the return of goods and services, for fancy management of units in crypto systems. Nobody can satisfy their wants or needs with decentralization, immutability, or scarcity. But only with goods and services.

638,investing,"I've been trying to figure out why anyone just trying to get the best short term safe interest rate on otherwise idle money would invest in T-Bills rather than a money market, today in late 2023.

I have some ideas why but am I missing anything?

1. T-bills at present offer a slightly higher interest rate.
2. T-bills have no expense ratio.  My guess is that is the reason for number 1 above.
3. T-bills rate won't change during the holding period. It's set until maturity. MM fund yields fluctuate.
4. T-bills can be traded.  For a profit sometimes. Or you can hold until maturity.

While Money Market funds have these advantages:

1. MM funds are more liquid.  You can cash out any time instantly. You can even write checks on a Money Market fund.
2. MM Funds could maybe be taxed at a lower rate if held long enouht to be considered long term capital gains.
3. MM Funds don't come with commissions in your brokage account by T-bills might.  I use Fidelity.

Did I miss anything?

My goal is to just make the most interest on money I don't intend to invest in the stock market for 6 months to a year.  So I've been considering T-bills for 6m or maybe 1 year maturity.   But then I look and the MM funds in my sweep or ""core"" accounts and they yield only a little lower.

With T-bills I GUESS it's about locking in a hopefully high rate if you expect interest rates to go down soon.  But right or wrong I don't. Not in the near future anyways.  T-notes or T-Bonds for longer terms I would think would be better for locking in what you THINK are going to be higher rates than possible lower rates a few years out.

This sounds like a no brainer but it is not since most consider current and expected future earnings to be the primary driver. 

For stocks demand is driven by people's need for saving for the future and passive income with their extra savings and short term speculation for price increases. 

Fed can increase the demand on stocks by inflating money supply as they did this during Covid and government can do it by reducing the tax burden on population. 

5 years ago when valuations are high, everyone including  Warren Buffet was pointing out interest rates as the reason for high valuations. Now we have reasonable interest rates but valuations are even higher because demand is still high due to inflated money supply, lower taxes and blind speculation that stocks will always go up. As always discussed here, the recommendation for anyone invest now independent from valuations and macro economic conditions so demand is decoupled from technicals.

For stocks, especialy blue chip stocks, there is limited supply inflexible to pricing.

This is the harsh learning for me but I still think at some point, technicals will kick in but who knows when this will happen.

Currently my portfolio is spread somewhat evenly across all 4 of these options.

Here's some random thoughts of mine from my investing journey since 2017.

**REIT**

I really like REITs because of the monthly dividend. There's just something about buying something and having it payout each month that is very desirable to me. Even knowing the returns will never be that of an individual stock win, I just *really* like the concept and consistency of the REIT. I'm tempted to dump 50% of my investments into REIT for this reason alone.

**Stocks**

As the old adage goes; Never buy an asset you don't understand. I figure that you should only buy a stock if you have a good reason, and I don't have much interest researching companies to try and find a good pick, though my mind could be changed on this if someone convinces me it's worth it.

I work in tech so I have a decent understanding of what tech companies do and I've had a few winners that I bought with *some* foresight. I bought AMD at $30 when I saw that Intel was releasing inferior processors at higher cost and trying to prevent hardware reviewers from reviewing them. I bought COIN near its bottom when I saw their stability in the wake of the crypto exchange disasters, and knowing a halving event is on the horizon (verdict is still out on this buy of course). Other stocks like ABBV have done well for me over the years, but I have absolutely no idea why because I know little about the healthcare industry. I lost some money on ABNB, and again I couldn't tell you why because I've never researched this company. I bought the stock a while back because I thought that ABNB would obsolete hotels.

On a long enough timeline, the value of any individual stock will fall to zero. So the question is, when do you sell? Seems to me that playing the individual stock game requires consistent ""maintenance"" and I wonder if it is worth the effort.

Also how much effort is worth spending on statistical analysis like P/E, market cap, volume etc.. ?

**ETF**

Safe and reliable. But it seems like *everyone* is buying these nowadays and recommending that you buy them. I've had VOO and SCHD as my main investments for a while now, and they *seem* to do well. but I can't help but wonder, If you do what everyone else is doing, how could you ever hope to perform above average? Or does it simply come down to the fact that if you are putting more into the market than the average person, you'll come out ahead with an 'average' return?

Is it possible for some kind of ETF apocalypse to happen where the market stagnates due to extreme diversification?

**Robo-investing**

On march of 2022, in the wake of the insane COVID stimulus rally, I came to the conclusion that I had no idea how to understand the market and decided to switch to Betterment. I set the risk to 'max' and started putting 50% of my investment money into Betterment and the remaining 50% into my personal brokerage split between stocks, ETF and REIT. Since then it's gotten me a 5.2% actual return with IRR at 11.2%

This investment vehicle doesn't seem much different that just buying some ETF myself, but maybe there is some happy middle-ground between overly-managed (stocks or human managed funds) and unmanaged (ETF) funds?

A major thorn in my side has been trying to understand foreign stocks vs US. Apparently there is an undulation where the U.S outperforms the rest of the world for several decades, followed by underperformance. I've bought some foreign stock ETFs but these have done poorly next to US companies. Betterment handles this automatically so I figure it's good to get some exposure here.

**Conclusion?**

Aside from derivatives and betting on crypto or individual stocks, the investment world seems like a homogeneous bowl of diversified funds. I'm kind of bored of investing and really just do it because I don't know how else to grow wealth aside from trying to get into real-estate.

&lt;p&gt;Robinhood 10 covered calls expiring Jan 17, 2025 are priced around $7.63. Again, completely reasonable that this could drop to $7, $8. But max profit would represent a 31% return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you don’t think Bitcoin or crypto in general is going anywhere, and you think coinbase will be the main beneficiary, would this call not be worth it, at over 1.12% potential max profit over the next 15 months? If prices drop, you can average down with each paycheck. Worst case, the stock is around $40 when $30 seems to be the floor and almost every other major crypto exchange has gone bust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robinhood despite all the hate, is not going anywhere and continues to expand its services. Their roadmap looks pretty interesting. I don’t use their platform because it’s not really suited for advanced trades but that could change with a revamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to invest about $5,000 to $7,000 monthly consistently over the next 2-3 years or longer into long term covered calls, and just not worry about the day to day stress of the market.

My question revolves around dividends. When a stock/ETF pays a dividend, should the amount of the dividend be recorded as a positive value? If I reinvest the dividend, should that txn be recorded as a negative value? My brokerage would show this on two lines: one line for the dividend paid and another line for the purchase of (reinvested) shares.

Is this correct?

I have reached a decent base for myself to build on in the market (around 15k) but now my short-term focus has shifted to rebuilding an emergency fund and cash position in case I should lose my job, go on holiday, move houses, (or another opportunity where I would benefit having easily accessible cash) etc.

I want to have around 12k in high yield savings or cash alternatives. The problem that I've found with myself is that I find it very easy to save money when buying into stocks (I don't want to weaken my portfolio+slightly more barriers to take money out) but as I don't have the best discipline with spending it takes longer for me to save when putting money into a savings account because it is so easy to access on a daily basis.

I am considering putting half of my cash into 4 week T-bills and half into a savings account in order to build my cash position to where I want it to be. Alternatively, I also have considered the option of doing the same with a bond-etf. Bond-etfs and T-bills are attractive to me because I won't be able to access this money as easily on a daily/weekly basis meaning I won't be tempted to spend it on going out vs a savings account. As far as I know I have both these options in either the US or Australian market. 

As I am still learning and I don't know much about bonds/bills, bond-etfs seems like an easy option I could buy right now but I don't know how they compare vs buying T-bills directly. It seems like there is a decent chance of having a negative return with bond-etfs but as I have a short horizon (probably about 12 months) maybe I don't have to worry too much about this.

I inherited a non-spousal traditional IRA from my parent, which is now in a Schwab Inherited IRA. They have the money invested in 14 separate ETF's / Funds. I want to sell it all and then just put all of it in SWVXX. 

I want to do this because I am in my 50's, not experienced or interested in trading at this time, and just want a safer place for the money to live while having liquidity. I do not want to pay an investment advisor to do this. 

The Schwab trade page is intimidating. Is there a simple way to sell everything? When I reviewed an order I was going to place, I selected ""sell all"" (of one fund), and selected ""market"" in the drop down. The current market value is $3,500 but the estimated sale price was only $1,700, so I canceled it. 

I tried this same procedure with another fund. Market value is $35,000 and it would give me about $34,700. These funds are nearly all a little in the red so this made sense, but the first one I tried does not make sense to me. 

Can someone help point me in the right direction to figure out how to *safely* sell all 14 funds so I can turn around and buy SWVXX?

I have recently sold a business and received a 7-figure windfall.

My public allocations have been deployed into ETFs and I am currently interviewing fund managers to determine the best private allocations.  

But herein lies my question for you investment wizards: should I wait a little longer before pulling the trigger on the private side and locking my money up for a significant amount of time and see what is coming down the pike for the US (and global) economy?  It seems the Oracle of Omaha and others are bearish on the near future of the stock market so wondering if I should wait to potentially buy stocks at a deep discount if the US economy and world economy enter into a deep recession.

What i'm looking for is a tool that automatically notifies me when a stock takes a big dip over a short timeframe (15% or more in a day for example, like you often see when a company misses earnings, etc).

It would be great to be able to tweak and filter stocks that I get a notification about, ie change the trigger amount, filter by market cap, sector, etc.

Does such a thing exist? :)

Thanks a lot!

edit: I should clarify that what I am looking to do is receive these alerts across all public stocks within the criteria I set. there's a few ways to do it on websites, but I want something that works in the background and pings me when a price movement meets my criteria.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, looking for advice/suggestions as i&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a tool for this already.

1. Unable to journal shares over

* I tried to employ Norbert's Gambit to save on Forex fees.
* Customer support (CS) said it would take 1-2 days, but after a week, it still had not been journaled over.
* After contacting CS again, they said they could only temporarily escalate the issue and journal the shares for a day. (meaning I had to execute the sale same day).

1. Unable to withdraw from Questwealth portfolio

* There is not easy way to withdraw everything from Questwealth (ie. no ""withdraw all"" button/option)
* They would not let me liquidate all assets in the portfolio and sit as cash, thus you simply have to guess at the portfolio value to withdraw everything
* After initiating a withdrawal and providing my banking details, they could not deposit the funds because I did not provide a void cheque (I have never known any banks to ask for a signed void cheque to DEPOSIT into an account, only for withdrawal)
* This ended up the account liquidating the assets then re-purchasing the shares at a higher price when the deposit did not go through.

1. Instant deposit is not actually instant

* I tried to fund an account via instant deposit. I thought it would be instant (hence the name), but after completing the transfer, it said ""funds are ready to invest after 1-2 days"" and I could not see the balance in the account.
* I then transferred more money using the ""slower"" pre-authorized payment method. They money came in much faster.
* After contacting CS, they said they could not even see the instant deposit transfer and asked for proof of deposit via a receipt. After providing the receipt, they said it would take ANOTHER 2-3 business days.

1. Customer Service

* All of their CS reps are always nice and all, however, I feel they have no idea what they are doing. They don't seem knowledgeable about the important things.

What set the Dragon Portfolio apart was Cole and Artemis' adoption of a fixed allocation approach.

In New Zealand, we do not have a capital gains tax, meaning investing within New Zealand doesn't incur tax on gains from selling shares as long as it doesn't fall under being a trader, rather than an investor.

Although there is no capital gains tax here, there are pseudo capital gains tax, and the FIF (Foreign Investment Fund) tax is one of those. It has 2 components: the tax on dividends exceeding 200NZD a year and capital gains off stocks where the investor CONTRIBUTED $50,000NZD in overseas assets. This only includes what the investor puts in, not accounting for increase in stock price.

I am employed by a company that is originally from the US, BUT operating in New Zealand as a New Zealand branch of that company (more accurate an ANZ or Australia/New Zealand branch). They have an ESPP program which allows the purchase of their stocks at a 5% discount, taken from your after-tax pay. Contribution % ranges from 3%-15%, letting you choose anywhere between that.

I want to invest in the US market, and I have done so. As much as I also invest in NZ, I don't want to keep my money in 1 market, that isn't efficient for growth or security for my portfolio.

* Berkshire Hathaway is the 7th largest market capitalization, behind Nvidia, with a valuation of $790 billion. (In comparison, BlackRock, well-known to the general public, has a market capitalization of $105 billion.)
* Berkshire Hathaway achieved $302 billion in revenue in 2022, a 9.37% increase from 2021.
* BH has over $73 billion in cash reserves.
* It holds stakes in companies like Coca Cola, Bank of America, and notably Apple, of which they own over 5%. It is basically an ETF (without dividends)

  
Warren Buffett is one of the world's best fund managers. He has some basic principles that we should all use:

* Invest only in businesses you understand, with favorable long-term prospects, led by competent management, and at reasonable prices.
* Look for a long-term competitive advantage in a stable industry.
* Seek exceptional companies at reasonable prices, not mediocre companies at bargain prices.  


  
The Risks I see:  


* The company's past performance has been incredible, but its current size will inevitably slow down its performance. 
* Warren Buffet is 93 years old. What is going to happen to BH when he die ? Even that seems ok: It's known that Howard Buffet will be the future Chairman and Greg Abel the future CEO when Warren is no longer around.

749,investing,"Hi all,

Mid 30s, looking to retire when I am due. I actually like my job. Savings totalling 300K. Leaving 100K aside for a near-future house downpayment.

I currently have 200K on 4-mo T-bills until I come up with a proper plan for that money. I see that long-term bonds yields are getting into a sweet spot &gt;4%. One of the possibilities I am contemplating is putting 50% of the capital on 30 yr bonds and the other 50% on VTI/VOO.

Rationale:

* I can probably lock in a 4.3 % yield annually.
* Maturity reached about the time I'll retire
* The bonds generate semiannual interest that I'll reinvest. Either on other bonds or ETFs.
* Assuming the interest can generate 3% interest on average, my 100K principal becomes \~300K by maturity date.
* Why not VOO/VTI and forget about it? Diversification (I plan on putting the other half on stocks). Also, will the mantra ""stock market produce 8% yield on average"" stay true in the future? I don't know, but I am sure the US Gov't will be there
* Inflation! Sure, there'll be inflationary periods, but that should be a fraction on the 30 yr timeline, no?

&lt;li&gt;How old are you? What country do you live in?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you employed/making income? How much?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The number was pretty shocking especially since it doesn't feel like I live all that extravagantly.   I've always planned to retire at age 45 or 50 or whatever (but I'll truthfully, I'll probably never retire, just start a new business and keep the mind strong) and my goal has always been $~~4~~ 5m in the stock portfolio so I can live on 4% of it which is $200,000 per year.  That seems reasonable, comfortable, and feasible especially if houses are paid off and college tuition is already put aside.

&amp;#x200B;

Well my buddy said, ""no, no, in 10 years your $200,000 spend per year is going to actually become $400,000 because the dollar will be worth way less! You actually need $10m to retire and keep your standard of living the same.""

My thought was, well I'm not saving cash that is weakening and losing to inflation, I'm owning stocks (mostly high growth stocks that trends along the DASDAQ).  Therefore every 10 years my portfolio will double historically if not more (we are currently at 283% on the 10 year coming off a massive low from Nov 2021 factored in).  So yes, my purchasing power might drop in 10 years and I need $400,000 to live the same way as $200,000 buys today but my portfolio will grow to match that if not exceed it especially if I'm only removing 4% each year and not the 6-10% it might grow on average.

What is the consensus here and who is thinking about this the right way?  Obviously being conservative and working harder to get that $10m nest egg is always the smartest option but is my train of thought flawed and I just don't understand something?

777,investing,"Hello all,

(TL;DR - income down and uncertain in the short term, big home improvement project coming up, way more money in stocks than savings. Need to tap into equities but unsure which ones would be best. Also seeking restructure/optimization advice on portfolio.)

Recent dip in income, trying to change careers, housing projects coming due - running into a situation where I think it would be more beneficial to liquidate shares and park in a high yield savings acct for less volatility with all the uncertainty in my short term future. Would love advice on which stocks/ETFs y'all think I should sell off or just general advice on my situation. 

Assets: currently ~$7k in checking/savings with upcoming deposit of $14k landing in the next few weeks. Bank offers 2% APY and I know I can get better returns elsewhere, just haven't really bothered as I keep most of my ""long-term"" money in stocks.

Income: TBD. Mortgage loan officer and times are tough. Followed a college to a new job with promises of greener grass but it isn't looking good. Pursuing career change for more stability. May take a few months+ for earnings to align with my target again. Wife works salary job @ $90k/yr.

Expenses: $2k/mo for my half of mtg + utilities + personal loan, $150 car payment. Round everything up and I'm probably $3k - $3,500/mo depending on how much fun I want to have on him weekends. 

Sitting on a $20k loan for the home project that I'm splitting payments on with the wife. Estimating another ~$10k+ on top for total project completion that will most likely come out of my pocket. Rate is 13.49%. Once the dust settles on the project plan is to pay it off aggressively depending on income. Got the loan as wife doesn't have full cash on hand and I'd rather have a slow trickle from my account rater than large lump sum payout. 

Got Robinhood in 2020 and quickly realized I have no idea what I'm really doing. Most of my money  is in ETFs but I think there's a fair amount of redundancy in my holdings and I'd probably benefit from consolidating. Some accounts are positive, some negative. Had to pay taxes last year but don't really anticipate that being the case for 2023.

I'm 28 so retirement is a far off horizon. Already maxing IRA and 401k so I consider my stocks to be more of a ""reserve"" account, ideally for long term growth but also access to additional funds if needed. Biggest fear I guess would be income stays low for a while while I figure things out, market tanks, now I'm selling stocks for pennies on the dollar to get by.

My thoughts/plan:

Sell off DAL, C, NDAQ, TAN, ICLN, &amp; SCHD for a total of $9,153 and net loss of $289. This should cover most of the additional housing expenses and minimize losses.

But what would you do from there, especially if I'm anticipating a big reduction in income for the next 6 months?  Been considering selling everything besides (V)ETFs and then shaving off additional equity as needed but idk if that would be most prudent. 

Thanks in advance. Didn't mean for this to turn into a text wall.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;

For those not in the know TSM fabs like 50% of apple chips, all NVDA chips. They are the most sophisticated chip fabrication plant on the globe. 

TSM is hanging right around the bottom of the channel of the uptrend. 

now this is a solid company, solid financials, 2% annual dividend, diversifying into arizona (with struggles) and germany (with both comes a lesser ability to produce chips than the main Taiwan factory), which removes **some** of the risk of being solely in Taiwan. Maybe a japan factory as well?

If you bought around 93-92 dollars, set a stop loss at say 87 or 86 being a significant break in trend, or maybe even as low as 84 or 83, a real break in the trend, you would lose somewhere between 6.5% to 10%. 

now if TSM continues the uptrend and we go to 100 you are up 7.5%

if we go to 105 youre up 12.9%

if TSM suprasses a high on its trip down in 2022 around 109 to hit 110, you're up 18.2%

and it just continues up from there, i mean you hit 115 and the risk reward is totally worth it. So you're a long term holder buying into the bottom of the uptrend and setting a stop loss around 88-87, 5-6% risk to make maybe 20% on the high upside, maybe 12.9-7.5 on the lowside. 

its a decent bet.

I bought a condo last week, all cash (basically our landlady told us to leave, and we were sick of getting kicked around from place to place, so just decided to buy the damn thing).

The condo maintenance fees plus property taxes comes to $1,000 per month. I'm considering purchasing $150,000 worth of 20 or 30 years long term government bonds, currently yielding a juicy 4.x%. That kind of deal will pay half my condo fees almost into perpetuity. Risk free!

Now of course this comes with massive duration risk, meaning that the nominal value of these bonds will plunge if interest rates were to rise. But considering that I don't intend to sell them and I'm keeping them only for the interest to pay my condo maintenance fees, that might not be a huge problem.

My goal is to secure myself in the worst possible scenario - let's say a market crash, followed by a 30-year bear market, where I lose my job and won't work again. Not likely, I know, but I want to prepare for it nonetheless.

798,investing,"Hello everyone. I'd like to bring up a question, more rooted in human psychology I bet, but closely tied to finances and investing. I'd appreciate hearing your opinions and finding out if I'm not alone in this, and what to do about it.  


A bit of background: I'm 27 years old, living in one of the European countries, and I've been involved in stock market investments for more than 3 years now. I started with stock picking, and it just so happened that during the COVID crisis in 2020, I bought quite a few stocks (most of them are from S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats) and other wide ETFs during the downturn. I continued to delve into the topic of investments, studied literature and some stuff, and realized that the stock-picking is not that I want to solely follow. The strategy that suits me is just a long-term investment in the broad market (FTSE All-World / MSCI World) to secure a stable passive income by the age of 45-50 and have a comfortable retirement. I've come to the conclusion that in my case, Irish accumulating ETFs are the most advantageous way, allowing me to defer tax payment until withdrawing the money and not pay taxes upon dividend receipt.  


The question here is that intellectually, I understand that it's more profitable for me to invest in Irish ETFs that accumulate dividends and don't pay them directly into my account but reinvest them in buying more stocks. However, I enjoy the fact of receiving dividends in my account, right when they come in and I get notifications, seeing the statistics. It seems to give me a certain sense of confidence, and it's just nice to see those income streams.  


Since I was about 19, I've enjoyed playing incremental, accumulating games (like idle/clickers) where I can see the results of my actions and how some characteristic accumulates. I mean, I liked compound interest in games, particularly the behavior of ""invested - received more soon."" It seems to stem from my childhood, perhaps some personality trait or something that influenced me - I'm not sure.  


Does anyone have any ideas on what to do? I'm thinking maybe to develop a strategy that I can reasonably reconcile with, to create two portfolios?

The issue is with current majority holder, oligarch Verevsky and his fund Namsen. His goal is to take advantage of the war prices and gather full ownership of the company.

He, alongside with the board of directors, initiated a process of delisting from stock exchange. That made many investors selling as most doesn't want to stay with the illiquid shares. He made a call to buy shares for a very low price - 18.5 PLN, what made his engagement up from 37% to 76%.

823,investing,"Dear fellow investors, and fellow participants,

I'd like to share some insights into my investment journey. In January 2022, I embarked on my investment voyage, adopting a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) approach with monthly contributions into IWDA. In February, I deviated slightly from this pattern, making a lump sum investment equivalent to five months' worth of contributions, but then resumed the regular DCA strategy. Throughout this journey, I've maintained a long-term perspective and remained unfazed by temporary losses or seeing my portfolio in the red.

In 2023, I decided to diversify my holdings further by investing in four individual stocks, allocating funds equivalent to three months' worth of expenses to each. I successfully executed this strategy, and at present, I've deployed roughly one-third of my capital, while two-thirds remain in cash.

However, the cash portion of my portfolio is currently parked in a savings account. Regrettably, in the world of Europoor banking. While this cash provides a sense of security, it's not doing much in terms of growing my wealth.

**The rationale behind maintaining a significant cash position is tied to my mortgage, which is due for a rate adjustment in approximately three years and a few months. Currently, I enjoy a favorable interest rate of just 1.7%. While I'm prepared for the possibility of higher rates, I prefer to have a cushion of funds readily available to handle any potential increases. This financial safety net, which comprises the two-thirds of my cash holdings, serves as a precautionary measure to ensure I can comfortably address any future rate adjustments.**

**Of course, I'll continue to generate income, save, and invest during this period, further bolstering my financial position. Consequently, my query is twofold: Where should I consider placing this (for me substantial) cash reserve, and should I be open to slightly more aggressive investment options given my longer time horizon, recognizing that I won't require these funds in the immediate three-year window?**

Your insights and advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

841,investing,"A  big challenge with long-term buy-and-hold in index funds is that many people have trouble sticking with the strategy through bad times - even though they know they should stick to it - and sell.  

Here is what I have found works for me as a psychological trick:  I track my portfolios in Mint, but do so manually (no auto-updates).  I track them as an ""asset"" or ""cash"" with a fixed number I manually input.  So the number only changes when I change the number.  And my rule is that those numbers only ever stay the same or go up (as a portfolio increases), never down (in bad times), because I am not going to realize losses and will eventually recover over the decades.  The losses aren't real because they aren't realized.  I have found this makes it much easier to ignore losses - because Mint tells me that if I don't sell, I'll return to a given number XXXXX if I just stick it out and wait to bounce back.

Example:  Portfolio of index funds starts valued at $100,000.  Market downturn takes its value down to $75,000, but I keep it set at $100,000 in Mint.  Market eventually recovers to $105,000, and I add that value into Mint at that time.

Note that this approach DOES still punish you a bit during a downturn:  Let's suppose that during the downturn to $75,000, I deposit $5,000 a month from my checking account into my index fund portfolio.  That money effectively ""disappears"" from Mint, because it decreases the value of my checking account and does not increase the value of my portfolio in Mint.  (It just increases the holdings in my real portfolio, which remain below the $100,000 value in Mint.)   

In some ways, this is like a poor-man's version of a hedge fund:  It doesn't actually hedge market risk (a real hedge [usually](https://youtube.com/watch?v=DZ2QZg_1pHQ&amp;t=387s&amp;ab_channel=HowMoneyWorks) costs you returns), but it psychologically makes you feel like you are hedged against market risk and makes it less psychologically painful to buy-and-hold through a downturn, because the set $100,000 is basically a representation of your anticipated recovery if you hold.

 Another benefit is that it makes you feel like you are making ""progress"" toward your financial goals:  Even if my portfolio is down over an entire year, if I am gaining a bit in cash, or real estate, or whatever else in Mint, it reflects my net worth increasing over time, which provides another big psychological boost.

In short, this is just a psychological strategy, not an investment strategy.  But if it makes it psychologically easier for some people to actually execute on their intended investment strategy of long-term buy-and-hold in index funds, it could provide better returns.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A  big challenge with long-term buy-and-hold in index funds is that many people have trouble sticking with the strategy through bad times - even though they know they should stick to it - and sell.  &lt;/p&gt;
