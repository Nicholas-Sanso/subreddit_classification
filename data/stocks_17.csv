12,stocks,"So I went with an advisor last September at Morgan Stanley. He re did my portfolio and then started talking to me about selling covered calls on my position of ETN. I explained to him that that options sound good as long as we have the possibility of closing out the option so to negat the risk of having the contracts exercised. He confirmed we could do that and said this was basically free money.   


We made anywhere from 1800 to 2000 on each contract. All was well but a couple months even more back i kept telling him we need to close out and just take whatever little premium we can get. I've done this with other options in the account   


But he never did it.  I pay him a monthly fee to manage the account so I just figured of course he knows what he's doing more then i do. which is true. which is why i'm paying a professional.   


well, he now has 5 open contracts that in theory could be called which would force me to sell all my entire ETN position and well below current market price.   


Even after i told him not to open more contracts he went ahead and did right when i hung up with him lol   


I don't know what to do now, i contacted his branch manager who appears to be on my side in all this thankfully.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

They could instead pay off all their outstanding notes, but considering the low rates on them, they could earn a risk free net return elsewhere.

Doubling their dividend could be an attractive option. They have been paying only .04 a quarter when they use to pay .16.

UBER vs LYFT. I own both but kind of wishing I didn't. They've both been discussed a lot here and on other subs and I think a lot of the sentiment surrounding Lyft has to do with their own personal experience with Lyft and how it's either been slower or more expensive, etc. You obviously can't understate the importance that food delivery has had with Uber and that's something that Lyft didn't capitalize on. But still- I'm up +123% on Uber and down -24% on Lyft. Considering they essentially have the same business model, that's pretty insane. And considering how well Uber is doing, if Lyft can't do well now- can they ever? Should I just be hoping they get acquired?

Speaking of acquisition bait- I foolishly bought Bird (BRDS) a year ago and it's since down a whopping -91%. It's obviously not coming back up and they could get acquired but idk if it's worth holding out for. As much as I believe in scooters as a first/last mile option, it seems like between the local governments not supporting parking programs and people refusing to share space on the sidewalk- the shine has worn off and the startups have fizzled out. Again, if they can't do well now when everyone else is doing well- is it time to cut my losses?

Beyond Meat (BYND) is another one where I'm down -22% and just hoping that someone picks them up and bails me out. I still eat their products but I'm ready to admit that the stock isn't going anywhere.

Last one- CVS. Down -15% after trying to only buy at what I thought was going to be the all-time low (lol). What is happening? It's crazy to me. It's the one stock that I genuinely don't understand. I don't even know where to start or how to end. 

I have quite a few more stinkers- TWOU (-57%), GAN (-56%), HBI (-42%), INND (-96%), OTLY (-56%), PTRAQ (-99%), and VFC (-55%). I'm sure each have their own story.

&gt;""To grow a business of this complexity this rapidly with such a recent inflection is remarkable supply chain performance.

&gt;""These are remarkable results, particularly in the context that the company is looking at so much unmet demand; the breadth of AI spending is clearly growing and appears to be durable. The company is executing across silicon, systems, software, and supply chain as the market is inflecting. It's fair to argue that the stock price discounts much of that, with an elevated multiple, but we don't see that changing.

&gt;We continue to prefer to be conservative on EPS and aim for a higher multiple given the longer-term importance of the TAM.

In August 2023, foreign investors set a new record by divesting $9.8 billion in Chinese stocks, driven by escalating concerns over China's crumbling property market. This historic monthly sell-off highlights the crisis's impact on the local stock market, with offloaded stocks totaling 71.6 billion yuan ($9.8 billion), the highest since the mainland-Hong Kong stock trading link began in 2014.

Rocket Lab successfully reflew an engine on an Electron launch Aug. 23 as the company moves a step closer to reusing the entire rocket booster.

The Electron rocket lifted off from the company’s Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 7:45 p.m. Eastern. The “We Love the Nightlife” mission deployed a Capella Space radar imaging satellite into a 640-kilometer mid-inclination orbit 58 minutes after liftoff.

The launch was originally scheduled for July 30 but scrubbed because of data from a sensor in one engine that indicated low igniter pressure. A second attempt on Aug. 6 was also scrubbed.

Rocket Lab decided to replace the entire booster with one that the company had just completed. The new booster, unlike the original one, was designed for recovery.

“The call was made to bring forward that recovery booster and swap the payload onto this Electron to tighten the turnaround to get back to the pad for Capella and accelerate our efforts to make Electron a reusable rocket at the exact same time,” Rocket Lab spokesperson Murielle Baker said during the launch webcast.

The booster not only was designed for reuse but also, among its nine Rutherford engines, was one that had flown on an Electron launch in May 2022. The engine had gone through what Rocket Lab described as multiple full-duration hotfire tests to confirm it could be flown again.

“The data is in, perfect performance from the reused engine and the stage,” Peter Beck, Rocket Lab chief executive, tweeted after the launch.

During an Aug. 8 earnings call, Beck suggested that reflying a Rutherford engine, then scheduled for some time before the end of the year, was one of the final steps before the company is ready to reuse an entire booster.

“From there we’ll schedule the first reflight of a full stage booster,” he said in the call, but did not offer a timeline for doing so beyond noting that additional improvements to support reusability were planned for the 45th flight of the vehicle.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-reuses-engine-on-electron-launch/""&gt;https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-reuses-engine-on-electron-launch/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

41,stocks,"Basically this is something I have seen a bit looking at valuation/analyses of companies online in the early 2000s, and I wanted to spark a discussion on the reasoning for/against the use of a liquidity discount. 

I just want to first cover some of the popular rationale for a liquidity discount. Usually the major point is of course in the name, liquidity, being that for many micro caps and small caps, in order to exit your position, you are likely to have to exit a large position at what was previously less than market price or you’re an investor that due to circumstance (say a mutual fund), values liquidity and the ability to sell out of a position in a day without losing a significant amount of value. 

The other main point I’ve seen is really just the positive correlation between illiquidity and volatility of stock price which kind of relates to the previous point but is different. 

The context for me is my investment in Nathan’s Famous (NATH) who has a great business model built by a moat on protecting and expanding their IP while monetizing it through licensing, food distribution, franchising, and company-operated restaurants. They have a low beta of 0.20, of course beta is market-relative volatility but the low volatility is clear, giving a cost of equity under basic formula of 5.70%, if you adjust debt and keep utilized ERP, it is still 8.20%. It has average liquidity of 14k daily or about $1M daily which I think is enough liquidity for a 300M MC company that no liquidity discount is needed and an 8% to 10% discount rate seems reasonable to me, but besides business stability which is definitely there, how much liquidity discount should there be, or should there even be one in mine and similar cases?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically this is something I have seen a bit looking at valuation/analyses of companies online in the early 2000s, and I wanted to spark a discussion on the reasoning for/against the use of a liquidity discount. &lt;/p&gt;

Peloton on Wednesday reported a wider-than-expected loss and a quarterly drop in new subscribers that it blamed on its recall of its Bike seat post and seasonality, sending shares plunging about 20%.

The company fell short of analysts’ earnings estimates but beat sales expectations.

Here’s how the fitness company did in its fourth fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

Loss per share: 68 cents vs. 38 cents expected

Revenue: $642.1 million vs. $639.9 million expected

The company reported a net loss of $241.8 million, or 68 cents per share, for the three-month period that ended June 30, compared with a loss of $1.26 billion, or $3.72 a share, a year earlier.

Sales dropped to $642.1 million, down $678.7 million a year earlier.

The company’s fiscal fourth quarter, which falls during the summer months, is traditionally slow not just for Peloton but also for other fitness retailers. Consumers have a tendency to pull back on workouts during the season as they travel and take part in other summer plans.

In May, CEO Barry McCarthy warned the fourth quarter would be among its most challenging from a growth perspective. For the first time, Peloton projected a decline in subscribers.

It ended the quarter with 3.08 million subscribers, up 4% year over year and in line with the company’s expectations. But compared with last quarter, subscribers declined by 29,000. Peloton attributed the drop to a “seasonal” slowdown in hardware sales and higher-than-anticipated churn.

“Peloton’s FYQ4 performance is a reminder we operate a seasonal business,” McCarthy wrote in a letter to shareholders.

“The slowdown exceeded our expectations through May and through the first three weeks of June as consumer spending shifted toward travel and experiences,” he wrote. “Then eight weeks ago the trend reversed itself, and we began to see a reacceleration in hardware sales.”

Peloton also believes the recall of its Bike seat post, which had a tendency to detach and break unexpectedly during use, created more churn than it expected. The metric stood at 1.4% for the quarter. The company suspects 15,000 to 20,000 people decided to pause their monthly subscriptions during the quarter while they waited for their seat post to be replaced.

The recall, announced in May, impacted more than 2 million Bikes the company had sold since January 2018 and cost $40 million in the quarter, far more than Peloton expected, McCarthy said. To date, the company has received 750,000 requests for replacement seat posts, which is also more than it had anticipated. So far, Peloton has fulfilled 340,000 requests and expects to wrap up the rest by the end of September.

Peloton narrowly reached positive free cash flow status on an adjusted basis, but doesn’t expect that will last during the next two quarters due to expected slowdowns in hardware sales, timing of inventory payments, marketing spending and the cash needed for the seat posts. However, it does expect to reach free cash flow positivity in the second half of fiscal 2024.

In premarket trading, Peloton’s shares plunged about 30%, but they regained some ground after the market opened. McCarthy commented on the stock price during his call with analysts, saying there is “enormous disconnect between the stock price” and the work the company is doing to drive growth.

“I don’t mean to sound like one of those CEOs who’s completely disconnected from the stock price, because it’s not lost on me,” said McCarthy. “But I have never been more optimistic, more excited about the future of the business.”

Strategy changes on the path to growth McCarthy, a former Netflix and Spotify executive, has spent the last three months focusing on new strategies aimed at getting the fitness company back on a path to growth.

The company has been working to capture customers who don’t have thousands of dollars to splurge on a stationary bike or treadmill by offering a rental program and a certified refurbished option. The rental service, which recently launched in Germany, now has more than 48,000 subscribers. The refurbished line brought in 6,500 sales during the quarter.

Both are “proving to be important growth initiatives,” McCarthy told shareholders.

Part of that strategy is the company’s rebrand under the guidance of its new Chief Marketing Officer Leslie Berland, a former Twitter (now known as X) executive. The retailer has positioned itself as a fitness company for all that is just as invested in its app as it is its pricey connected fitness products, such as its Bike, Tread and Row.

In May, it unveiled a series of new pricing tiers for its fitness app that includes an unlimited free membership option (with no credit card required) and levels that cost $12.99 and $24 monthly. The app allows consumers to watch Peloton’s fitness classes and build their own workouts from wherever they are, including their gym.

Since the relaunch, the company has clocked more than 900,000 app downloads, over two-thirds of which were non-Peloton members. It is also seeing more purchases of its higher-priced membership tier than it expected. It ended the quarter with 256,000 free monthly active users.

“The anytime, anywhere, anyplace message is absolutely landing,” McCarthy said on a call with analysts.

“The last objective \[of the relaunch\] was to remind people that, and particularly with the launch of the app, that it’s more than just a stationary bike company and that message is also finding traction.”

Peloton is also seeing “meaningful positive shifts in perception across a range of measures” including gains among Gen Z consumers and others who may be older but still new to fitness. Peloton is also seeing a shift in the types of people who are downloading its app toward men, Gen Z, Black and Hispanic consumers.

As part of the rebrand, Peloton is beginning to offer a variety of “limited edition bike frame colors and graphics to both the consumer and commercial markets,” McCarthy said.

“For the last ten years Peloton has been the Henry Ford of stationary bikes. We sold any color bike frame you wanted as long as you wanted black,” he told shareholders. “I’m excited to announce a change in strategy. ... Expect to hear more about this exciting initiative this fall.”

Peloton has also been leaning into its business-to-business strategy to further drive revenue and capture new customers. Earlier this month, it announced the launch of Peloton for Business, which allows companies to offer access to the app and its connected fitness products through its benefits offerings.

Clients include Volvo, which has Peloton bikes in its company fitness center and offers employees access to the Peloton app, its all-access membership and discounts on hardware, including the Bike, Bike+, Tread and Guide. Dropbox offers a similar package to its employees.

Peloton also launched a new program aimed at partnering with NCAA Division 1 schools. The new strategy kicked off Tuesday with its announcement that it will be partnering with the University of Michigan to create co-branded Peloton bikes that will be used at the school’s various fitness facilities – and along the sidelines at the school’s football stadium, known as the Big House.

“Expect to hear more announcements about additional global partners in the weeks ahead,” McCarthy said.

It also launched a new discounted offering for college students of its “One” tier, which typically costs $12.99 a month but will be cut to $6.99 a month.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/23/peloton-pton-earnings-q4-2023.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/23/peloton-pton-earnings-q4-2023.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I will highlight some notable quotes from the recent interview with former St. Louis Fed James Bullard. He resigned on Aug 14, 2023. Although he was known as one of the most hawkish Fed member, he was also correct over the last 2 years in expecting inflation to be sticky, and expecting the Fed to hike way more than what anyone ever anticipated. He is also one of the most bullish, arguing that the economy is more resilient than people think. He is also in the camp of shorter lag for rate hike, arguing that most of the rate hike effect have already passed through to the real economy (you can observe that when he said the easing of financial condition after SVB is feeding into a stronger 2H 2023).

&amp;#x200B;

There's an interesting statement where he said there're a lot of recession scenarios in the June 2023 FOMC dot plot (not the Fed staff forecast made by economists at the Fed, but the actual dot plot by FOMC members. In June and July, Powell said he disagreed with the Fed staff recession forecast, and the Fed revised up full year 2023 real GDP growth from 0.4% to 1%). No current Fed officials will ever admit they have a recession in their forecast. Only former Fed officials like Richard Clarida and James Bullard can talk openly about these things. To get around using the word ""recession"", Fed officials might use words like ""softish"" or ""bumpy"" landing, which are equivalent to a mild recession. I've even seen big banks like Morgan Stanley consider a mild recession as ""soft landing"", and they were the early soft landing forecasters, along with Goldman Sachs.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Bullard**: I think it’s turning out that the **Fed’s policy has been very successful**, and I think that will be the **buzz at Jackson Hole**. I don’t know what will be in the speeches, but the **talk will be that this has been quite successful**.

&amp;#x200B;

There were a lot of **heavy predictions of recession**. I think those were just **overblown**.

Because of the SVB situation, **rates actually went down in the spring**. And there’s been an unwitting **easing of financial conditions**, which is feeding into a **stronger second half for the U.S. economy**. And now everyone’s scrambling to **reprice based on that stronger economy.**

&amp;#x200B;

The f**aster growth is a bit of a threat** because the **forecast was that you’d have very weak growth or even a recession**, and now that **doesn’t really look like** it is **materializing**. So you’d have to **upgrade your outlook for inflation** probably based on that alone. You still have a **very tight labor market**, and now you have a **reacceleration in the U.S. economy**. The **risks are tilting** a little bit more toward the idea that **inflation won’t fall as fast as anticipated.**

&amp;#x200B;

Bullard: I’m **skeptical that we’re returning** to that **\[pre-pandemic environment of low interest rate and low inflation**\]. You’ve got **inflation above \[the Fed’s 2%\] target**, and it’s probably **going to be relatively sticky above target.** Roughly speaking, the **policy rate** would **have to be higher than** the **inflation rate during that whole period when inflation is above target**. That sounds like a **higher interest-rate regime** than the **one that has existed since 2008.**

&amp;#x200B;

And in the **’70s, you had similar shocks and the Fed didn’t react enough or fast enough.** They **stopped up short**, and you got a **decade of high and variable inflation**. This time **we reacted more appropriately** and more effectively, and now we’re **getting the fruits of that** by **getting inflation down.**

&amp;#x200B;

Bullard: The \[Fed’s rate-setting\] **committee will have to re-evaluate its forecast in September** for the summary of economic projections. And those **projections in June still had a big element of a recessionary scenario**—which at least, as of today, looks like it’s **blown out of the water**. That suggests that the **committee would keep its rate increase in there for sometime this fall**. It seems like you’d **probably follow through on the rate increase** that was **penciled in in June.**

The bigger question for markets, though, is **whether the economy really does accelerate quite a bit in the second half of 2023** and the **committee feels compelled** to, let’s say, **go above 6% on the policy rate**—possibly because some of the **inflation readings turn around and blip up** or maybe have a little bit of a **sustained increase.**

**I don’t think markets** are really **ready for that. But that’s an increasing risk** now.

&lt;p&gt;The f&lt;strong&gt;aster growth is a bit of a threat&lt;/strong&gt; because the &lt;strong&gt;forecast was that you’d have very weak growth or even a recession&lt;/strong&gt;, and now that &lt;strong&gt;doesn’t really look like&lt;/strong&gt; it is &lt;strong&gt;materializing&lt;/strong&gt;. So you’d have to &lt;strong&gt;upgrade your outlook for inflation&lt;/strong&gt; probably based on that alone. You still have a &lt;strong&gt;very tight labor market&lt;/strong&gt;, and now you have a &lt;strong&gt;reacceleration in the U.S. economy&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;risks are tilting&lt;/strong&gt; a little bit more toward the idea that &lt;strong&gt;inflation won’t fall as fast as anticipated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullard: I’m &lt;strong&gt;skeptical that we’re returning&lt;/strong&gt; to that &lt;strong&gt;[pre-pandemic environment of low interest rate and low inflation&lt;/strong&gt;]. You’ve got &lt;strong&gt;inflation above [the Fed’s 2%] target&lt;/strong&gt;, and it’s probably &lt;strong&gt;going to be relatively sticky above target.&lt;/strong&gt; Roughly speaking, the &lt;strong&gt;policy rate&lt;/strong&gt; would &lt;strong&gt;have to be higher than&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;inflation rate during that whole period when inflation is above target&lt;/strong&gt;. That sounds like a &lt;strong&gt;higher interest-rate regime&lt;/strong&gt; than the &lt;strong&gt;one that has existed since 2008.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the &lt;strong&gt;’70s, you had similar shocks and the Fed didn’t react enough or fast enough.&lt;/strong&gt; They &lt;strong&gt;stopped up short&lt;/strong&gt;, and you got a &lt;strong&gt;decade of high and variable inflation&lt;/strong&gt;. This time &lt;strong&gt;we reacted more appropriately&lt;/strong&gt; and more effectively, and now we’re &lt;strong&gt;getting the fruits of that&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;getting inflation down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullard: The [Fed’s rate-setting] &lt;strong&gt;committee will have to re-evaluate its forecast in September&lt;/strong&gt; for the summary of economic projections. And those &lt;strong&gt;projections in June still had a big element of a recessionary scenario&lt;/strong&gt;—which at least, as of today, looks like it’s &lt;strong&gt;blown out of the water&lt;/strong&gt;. That suggests that the &lt;strong&gt;committee would keep its rate increase in there for sometime this fall&lt;/strong&gt;. It seems like you’d &lt;strong&gt;probably follow through on the rate increase&lt;/strong&gt; that was &lt;strong&gt;penciled in in June.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger question for markets, though, is &lt;strong&gt;whether the economy really does accelerate quite a bit in the second half of 2023&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;committee feels compelled&lt;/strong&gt; to, let’s say, &lt;strong&gt;go above 6% on the policy rate&lt;/strong&gt;—possibly because some of the &lt;strong&gt;inflation readings turn around and blip up&lt;/strong&gt; or maybe have a little bit of a &lt;strong&gt;sustained increase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t think markets&lt;/strong&gt; are really &lt;strong&gt;ready for that. But that’s an increasing risk&lt;/strong&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

* The new contract includes pay raises for both part-time and full-time workers.
* It also includes other improvements to work rules including an end to forced overtime.
* Workers began voting on the new contract on August 2.

American Airlines also approved 46% increase in compensation and the UAW is also demanding 46% increase in compensation, voting on August 22nd whether or not to authorize a strike.

UPS workers ratified a massive five-year labor deal that includes big wage increases and other improvements to work rules and schedules, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said Tuesday.

The deal passed with 86.3% of votes, the highest contract vote in the history of Teamsters at UPS, according to the union.

“Teamsters have set a new standard and raised the bar for pay, benefits, and working conditions in the package delivery industry. This is the template for how workers should be paid and protected nationwide, and nonunion companies like Amazon better pay attention,” Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien said in a statement.

UPS and the Teamsters union, which represents about 340,000 workers at the delivery giant, reached a preliminary deal last month, narrowly averting a strike that could have rippled throughout the U.S. economy as the previous contract expiration on July 31 approached.

UPS moves $3.8 billion worth of goods a day, about 5% of the country’s gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The parties had until July 31, when the previous labor contract was set to expire, to reach a deal and avoid a work stoppage. Workers began voting on the new contract on August 2. It’s the single largest collective bargaining agreement ever reached in the private sector, according to the union.

Part-time workers will make no less than $21 an hour, up from a minimum of $15.50 currently, according to the union. Part-time pay was a sticking point during labor negotiations. Full-time workers will average $49 an hour. Current workers will get $2.75 more an hour this year and $7.50 an hour more during the five-year contract.

UPS drivers will average $170,000 in pay and benefits at the end of the five-year deal, CEO Carol Tomé said on an earnings call earlier this month.

The company cut its full-year revenue and margin forecasts, citing the “volume impact from labor negotiations and the costs associated with the tentative agreement.”

The union is the latest labor organization to push a major U.S. company for better pay, schedules and other work rules in the wake of the pandemic and decades-high inflation.

On Monday, American Airlines
pilots ratified a four-year deal that includes roughly 46% increases in compensation, including 401(k) contributions, a deal the carrier sweetened after rival United Airlines reached a richer agreement with its pilots’ union. Delta Air Lines

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street tried to build momentum following positive sessions for the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 109 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures both added about 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite posted its biggest advance of the month during Monday’s main trading session, rising 1.6%. The S&amp;P 500 added close to 0.7%. The two benchmarks snapped a four-day slide, and the Nasdaq notched its biggest one-day advance since August. The Dow ticked down 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Notably, the broad market index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were able to post gains even as the yield on the 10-year Treasury reached its highest level since November 2007, gaining about 9 basis points to trade at 4.34%. Tech shares historically struggle in a high-rate environment, making the tandem rise with yields on Monday more striking for Wall Street.
*****
&gt; “We’re seeing a positive return in the stock market, [which] we didn’t see last week. We think rates are going to be higher for longer and maybe the stock market’s okay with it,” Katy Kaminski, chief market strategist at AlphaSimplex, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; To be sure, some on Wall Street are not confident the rally can continue for much longer.
*****
&gt; “Typically, spikes in Treasury yields expose other areas of weakness. The rise in yields will make debt refinancing even more burdensome. … Another reason yields are rising is that investors are beginning to get realistic on the Fed’s path (more rate hikes may come),” said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.
*****
&gt; “This is a risk to tech stocks and growth stocks with high PE multiples. Therefore, we expect additional downside in the equity market is likely,” Horneman continued.
*****
&gt; Consumer retail giants Lowe’s and Macy’s reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday before the bell. Lowe’s gained 2.5% premarket after posting mixed results but reaffirming its full-year guidance, while Macy’s stock price edged lower on a cautious forecast for the full year.
*****
&gt; Investors are keeping a close eye on Nvidia’s earnings due Wednesday. Its shares rose more than 8% Monday, making it one of the largest tech gainers. The company is largely seen as a bellwether on the AI-boom and sentiment.
*****
&gt; On the economic data front, Wall Street will be looking toward the Philadelphia Fed’s nonmanufacturing survey, as well as the Richmond Fed’s manufacturing survey results. Existing home sales data for July is also scheduled for release Tuesday morning.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s remarks at Jackson Hole on Friday for more insight on the central bank’s inflation outlook.

72,stocks,"In the world of finance, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed how trading is conducted. One prominent AI model that has garnered attention is ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI. While AI has shown remarkable capabilities, especially in natural language processing, it is essential to explore whether human stock traders still possess a distinct edge. In this article, we delve into the nuances of stock trading, highlighting the unique qualities that make human traders superior to ChatGPT.


**Intuition and Emotional Intelligence**
Human stock traders possess an innate ability to leverage intuition and emotional intelligence when making investment decisions. They can factor in market sentiment, news events, and global trends that might not be fully captured by AI models like ChatGPT. For instance, during times of economic uncertainty, human traders can intuitively navigate market volatility, adjusting their strategies based on a nuanced understanding of the prevailing emotions. This aspect of human trading can significantly impact decision-making and yield successful outcomes.

**Adaptability to Market Dynamics**
Markets are inherently complex and dynamic, influenced by various factors such as geopolitical events, economic indicators, and unexpected news. Human traders are better equipped to adapt to these changing dynamics, as they can quickly process and interpret new information. Unlike ChatGPT, which relies on pre-existing data and patterns, human traders can apply their knowledge and adapt their strategies in real time to capitalize on emerging opportunities or mitigate risks.

**Contextual Understanding**
Stock trading involves more than just numbers and patterns. It requires a deep understanding of the broader economic and business landscape. Human traders possess the ability to discern contextual cues that might not be evident in datasets used by AI models. This understanding allows them to anticipate market shifts and make informed decisions based on their comprehensive grasp of market dynamics.

**Complex Decision-Making**
The decisions made by human traders often involve multifaceted considerations that go beyond quantitative analysis. Factors like company leadership, industry trends, and long-term growth potential play a vital role in investment choices. Human traders can synthesize various pieces of information, apply critical thinking, and make judgments that are not solely reliant on historical data – a level of complexity that AI models like ChatGPT might struggle to replicate.

**Unpredictability and Black Swan Events**
Financial markets are susceptible to black swan events – rare, unexpected occurrences that can have a profound impact on global economies and markets. The COVID-19 pandemic serves as a recent example of such an event. Human traders have the cognitive flexibility to respond to unprecedented situations and adjust their strategies accordingly. Their ability to think beyond conventional patterns is crucial when faced with these unforeseen challenges.

**Ethical Considerations and Accountability**
While AI models like ChatGPT lack moral agency, human traders are accountable for their decisions. They are bound by ethical considerations and the consequences of their actions. This accountability fosters responsible decision-making and prevents the implementation of strategies that might yield short-term gains at the expense of long-term stability – a restraint that AI models might not inherently possess.

**Subjective Evaluation of Data**
Human traders have the capacity to evaluate data subjectively, considering qualitative factors that might not be directly quantifiable. This allows them to develop a more holistic view of a company's potential and make investment choices that align with their convictions. For instance, they can assess corporate culture, values, and future prospects through a lens that AI models might struggle to replicate due to the inherent subjectivity involved.

While AI models like ChatGPT have showcased remarkable capabilities in various fields, the realm of stock trading remains an area where human traders maintain a distinct edge. The ability to leverage intuition, adapt to dynamic market conditions, understand context, make complex decisions, and respond to unpredictable events sets human traders apart. Furthermore, the ethical considerations, accountability, and the capacity for subjective evaluation of data make human traders an indispensable presence in the financial world. As technology continues to evolve, it is crucial to recognize and preserve the unique qualities that humans bring to the art of stock trading.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the world of finance, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed how trading is conducted.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Evidently they have a lot of orders currently with big deposits, along with a backlog of 1,900,000 orders waiting to be filled with a late 2023 or early 2024 release date.  
According to this article, that is a five-year backlog.  

“Tesla Cybertruck Orders Surpass 1.9 Million, 5 Year Wait Times” 

There are now over 1.9 million orders for the long-awaited Tesla Cybertruck, per a crowd-sourced data tracker. Speaking on an Earnings Call earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that demand for the Cybertruck is ""so off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.”

Given that Tesla plans to produce 375,000 Cybertrucks a year at peak capacity, new orders will technically take around 5 years to arrive. 

It seems to me that Tesla would be a great place to jump in if it falls to $200 per share.  I don’t see it going much lower than $200.00

82,stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- An exchange-traded fund that aimed to track CNBC anchor Jim Cramer’s stock picks is planning to shutter just five months after launching.

The Long Cramer Tracker ETF (ticker LJIM) will stop trading Sept. 11, according to a press release Monday. The fund, which buys stocks recommended by the host of CNBC’s Mad Money show, has only managed to attract $1.3 million in assets amid gains of just 2.2% since its debut in March.

Tuttle Capital Management chief executive Matt Tuttle launched LJIM alongside the $3.4 million Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF (SJIM), which bets against Cramer’s stock calls and will continue to trade. While LJIM has actually outperformed its bearish Cramer counterpart, Tuttle says he is shutting the fund after failing to attract the attention of the CNBC host. 

“We started LJIM in order to facilitate a conversation with Jim Cramer around his stock picks as the other side to the Short Cramer ETF,” Tuttle said in the press release. “Unfortunately, Mr. Cramer and CNBC have been unwilling to engage in dialogue and instead have chosen to ignore the funds, therefore there is no reason to keep the long side going. Going forward we will just focus on the short side.”

A CNBC spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Despite a slide in August, LJIM has gained about 2.2% on a total return basis since inception, with Nvidia Corp., Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Oracle Corp. among its biggest holdings. SJIM, which also short-sells Cramer’s picks in addition to buying companies he recommends against, has dropped 4.4% over that span. 

Tuttle told Bloomberg’s Trillions podcast in March that he and two colleagues monitor Cramer’s television appearances and social media accounts to put together the fund’s actively managed portfolios, which charge 1.2%. A CNBC spokesperson said at the time that Cramer encourages long-term investing through “a balanced portfolio that includes index funds and individual stocks.”

----------------------------

According to the latest New York Federal Reserve employment survey released Monday, the average “reservation wage,” or the minimum acceptable salary offer to switch jobs, rose to $78,645 during the second quarter of 2023.

That’s an increase of about 8% from just a year ago and is the highest level ever in a data series that goes back to the beginning of 2014. Over the past three years, which entails the Covid era, the level has risen more than 22%.

The number is significant in that wages increasingly have been recognized as a driving force in inflation. While goods prices have abated since pushing overall inflation to its highest level in more than 40 years in mid-2022, other factors continue to keep it well above the Fed’s targeted rate of 2%.

The New York Fed data is consistent with an Atlanta Fed tracker, which shows wages overall rising at a 6% annual rate but job switchers seeing 7% gains.

Employers have been trying to keep pace with the wage demands, pushing the average full-time offer up to $69,475, a 14% surge in the past year. The actual expected annual salary rose to $67,416, a gain of more than $7,000 from a year ago and also a new high.

Though there was a gap between the wage workers wanted and what was offered, satisfaction with compensation and upward mobility increased across the board.

With markets on edge over what the Fed’s next policy step will be, more signs of a tight labor market raise the likelihood that policymakers will keep interest rates higher for longer. At their July meeting, officials noted that wages “were still rising at rates above levels assessed to be consistent with the sustained achievement” of the 2% inflation goal, minutes from the meeting said.

Monday’s survey results also showed some other mixed patterns in the labor market.

Job seekers, or those who have looked for work in the previous four weeks, declined to 19.4% from 24.7% a year ago. That came as job openings fell by 738,000 to 9.58 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The likelihood of switching jobs fell, dropping to 10.6% from 11% a year ago, while expectations of being offered a new job also declined, to 18.7% from 21.1%.

88,stocks,"Once in a while, I get a message or an email, with a certain company name that has a price/book ratio below 1, and the question at the end is ""What am I missing"" or ""Does this make sense""?

The goal of this post is to elaborate on why a low price-to-book ratio doesn't necessarily mean a company is cheap. The post is divided into the following segments:

\- The theory

\- Example - Big Lots

\- Going concern

\- Conclusion  
**The theory**

The theory is quite simple. If a company has a price-to-book ratio of 1, the market price is in line with the book value of the company.

If the ratio is below 1, you can buy the **book value** of the company for a lower price. Should you buy a company with such a ratio, you get more than what you pay for (**in accounting terms**). 

On the other side, if the ratio is above 1, you'll be paying a premium compared to the **book value**.

I've bolded a couple of words, and that's where the catch is.  
**Example - Big Lots**

Although the theory is simple, the practice is not so much.

Let me introduce you to Big Lots, a furniture &amp; home decor retailer.

Its market cap is roughly $210m. Let's assume that you have the option to buy the entire company for $250 (a premium is often paid for a transaction of this type). **This is the price.**

If you take a look at the book value (which is total assets minus total liabilities), that is equal to $550 million! **This is the book value.**

Based on these two numbers, we can calculate a price-to-book ratio of 0.45.

So, can you not buy the entire business for $250, sell all the assets, pay all the liabilities, and collect the remaining $550? In this case, **we assume that the book value is equal to the liquidation value.**

  
*Imagine that you've done this. You've paid $250 million and now you own Big Lots. Now what?*

Let's see what that would look like in practice: Big Lots has total assets of $3.66 billion and total liabilities of $3.11 billion.

The 3 big buckets when it comes to assets are:

\- $1.1 billion of inventories  
\- $1.5 billion of operating leases (Right-of-use assets)  
\- $750 million of property, plant, and equipment

This explains over 90% of all the assets. So, how can this be converted into cash, so the liabilities can be settled, and you are left with $550 million?

&amp;#x200B;

***Inventories***

  
How can one get rid of $1.1 billion of inventories? There are two main ways:

1. As this is a retail company, you can choose to sell them through regular business operations. The catch? The company is not profitable. Over the last quarter, it sold $730m of inventories for $1.1 billion in net sales and reported a net loss above $200m. To sell $1.1 billion of inventories, it would take around 5 months, and it is quite clear that the outcome will not be $1.1 billion in cash, but closer to $700m (assuming the company losses $400m throughout these 5 months). But imagine what this would look like. You have all the stores with 100% inventory, then 80% inventory, then 50% inventory, then 20% inventory. It is unlikely that the inventory will go down to 0 unless special discounts are offered. Which means the $700m mentioned above, might be an overstatement.
2. You could call a competitor, and offer them the inventory. You'll likely hear a positive answer and an offer of $500m or $600m. Wait, you might ask, isn't the book value $1.1 billion? How come the offer is so low? Big Lots paid $1.1 billion to the manufacturing companies, to buy the inventory and have it delivered to their stores/warehouses. The competitors can do exactly the same, for the same price. In addition, the competitors don't have to order $1.1 billion at once and tie a lot of their capital. They could order a lot less. Therefore, you, as the new owner of Big Lots, have no negotiation power.  


Already, you can see that the **book value is not equal to the liquidation value**. This is only one of the three main assets of the business.

  
***Operating leases (Right-of-use assets)***

The previous owners/managers of the business, have signed numerous leasing contracts (for properties, equipment, vehicles, etc.) and these assets provide value to Big Lots. Canceling these contracts would also remove the lease liability on the other side of the balance sheet.

So, this should be straightforward, right? Not really, no.

To expect that you can ring anyone, and cancel the contract ""as of tomorrow"" is unreasonable.   
There will either be a notice period or a cancellation fee/fine.

  
***Property, plant and equipment***

At least this one should be easy, right? Well, I have some bad news.

Selling land &amp; buildings in today's market might not be the most difficult task. But how about all the equipment and vehicles that the company owns? I'm referring to the small ones such as stalls and cash registers, all the way to their forklifts and delivery vehicles.

To get rid of them on short notice, you'd have to sell them at a discount.

&amp;#x200B;

***What else is missing?***

This is not all. How about the employees? Liquidating a company of this size will not happen without severance pays.    
**Going concern**

So, why do we have those book values if they don't represent the liquidation value? Because there is something called **""going concern""**. It is a fundamental assumption, that the company (in this case Big Lots), will remain operating into the foreseeable future, rather than undergo a liquidation.

Therefore, the financial statements have been prepared on a **""going concern basis""**.  
**Conclusion**

This is a simple example, that illustrates how different the liquidation value might be compared to the book value. Imagine if there was $1 billion of goodwill on the balance sheet. That's not something that you can sell.

Let me be clear, this post has nothing to do with Big Lots and its value. It is solely here for educational purposes. There are plenty of scenarios that could happen to the company in the future. It could become profitable again, it could get acquired, it could go bankrupt, or it could be in a tough spot for a long time.

On the other side, think of companies with high price-to-book value in the tech industry. These companies do not have to invest heavily in assets, so using the price-to-book ratio is completely pointless.

Big Lots paid $1.1 billion to the manufacturing companies, to buy the inventory and have it delivered to their stores/warehouses. The competitors can do exactly the same, for the same price. In addition, the competitors don&amp;#39;t have to order $1.1 billion at once and tie a lot of their capital. They could order a lot less. Therefore, you, as the new owner of Big Lots, have no negotiation power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, you can see that the &lt;strong&gt;book value is not equal to the liquidation value&lt;/strong&gt;. This is only one of the three main assets of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Operating leases (Right-of-use assets)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous owners/managers of the business, have signed numerous leasing contracts (for properties, equipment, vehicles, etc.) and these assets provide value to Big Lots. Canceling these contracts would also remove the lease liability on the other side of the balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this should be straightforward, right? Not really, no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To expect that you can ring anyone, and cancel the contract &amp;quot;as of tomorrow&amp;quot; is unreasonable.&lt;br/&gt;
There will either be a notice period or a cancellation fee/fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Property, plant and equipment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least this one should be easy, right? Well, I have some bad news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selling land &amp;amp; buildings in today&amp;#39;s market might not be the most difficult task. But how about all the equipment and vehicles that the company owns? I&amp;#39;m referring to the small ones such as stalls and cash registers, all the way to their forklifts and delivery vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get rid of them on short notice, you&amp;#39;d have to sell them at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What else is missing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not all. How about the employees? Liquidating a company of this size will not happen without severance pays.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Going concern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why do we have those book values if they don&amp;#39;t represent the liquidation value? Because there is something called &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;going concern&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a fundamental assumption, that the company (in this case Big Lots), will remain operating into the foreseeable future, rather than undergo a liquidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the financial statements have been prepared on a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;going concern basis&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple example, that illustrates how different the liquidation value might be compared to the book value. Imagine if there was $1 billion of goodwill on the balance sheet. That&amp;#39;s not something that you can sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear, this post has nothing to do with Big Lots and its value. It is solely here for educational purposes. There are plenty of scenarios that could happen to the company in the future. It could become profitable again, it could get acquired, it could go bankrupt, or it could be in a tough spot for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, think of companies with high price-to-book value in the tech industry. These companies do not have to invest heavily in assets, so using the price-to-book ratio is completely pointless.&lt;br/&gt;

# Introduction:

DUOL is a freemium app that offers language learning in a gamified form. It is the largest language learning app by subscriber in the market and the only one which can be used almost entirely free. Management's path forward is well defined, releasing an additional tier that utilizes generative AI to personalize the learning experience and leveraging off any future AI development to help with their business. Management has identified 3 broad areas that they are working on (1) how well they teach, (2) how well they monetize and (3) how well they retain.  


# Investment Thesis 1:

***Advantageous Business Model***  
DUOL is free to use as compared to their competitors, this easy access to DUOL may be advantageous as 67% of people want their language learning app to be free ([SOURCE](https://civicscience.com/the-word-on-language-learning-apps-whats-behind-their-growing-popularity/#:~:text=Single%2Dlanguage%20speakers%20are%20likely,become%20fluent%20in%20another%20language)). Their close competitors such as Rosetta Stone, Babbel and Busuu all require a monthly subscription. DUOL is currently the only language learning app to be able to offer their services for free (excluding in-app purchases) as they are supplemented by their advertising arm of the business. DUOL is the only one able to set up a significant advertising arm due to their very high Monthly Active Users (MAU).  


# Investment Thesis 2:

***Strong Word of Mouth Advertising***  
With the largest MAU out of all of their competitors this advantage snowballs on its own, DUOL is able to save a significant portion on advertising as their MAU helps DUOL to advertise. By posting their ""streaks"" or achievements e.g. year in review it helps to spread the word for DUOL. ""80% of Duolingo’s users were acquired through word of mouth"" ([SOURCE](https://www.adexchanger.com/strategy/organic-marketing-is-duolingos-lingua-franca/))  


# REVENUE:

  
DUOL’s management has recognized 2 sources of revenue  (1) “Bookings” and (2) Revenue. The difference is that Bookings represent the total potential revenue that can be collected from subscribers, whereas revenue is when DUOL has actually given the goods and services and can recognize revenue. I believe that in my forecast I should forecast revenue rather than bookings as subscription revenue is not actual revenue in pocket yet, subscribers could cancel at any point of time so I will apply the conservatism principle here.   
  
For Monthly Active Users(MAU), I’ll use Q4 of each year’s numbers.   
To Forecast MAU, I believe that DUOL’s subscriber growth trajectory will be similar to other subscription based model e.g. NFLX. They will experience explosive growth followed by mediocre growth as they switch to focusing on monetizing existing MAU. As DUOL has just started catching on, I assume that the high growth period will be 5 years followed by mediocre growth of 2 years before tapering to slow growth for the rest of my forecast. High growth Y/Y was taking historic trends, mediocre and slow growth is taking about half of the previous phase’s Y/Y.  
  
For Paid Subscribers, I’ll use Q4 of each year’s numbers.   
To Forecast Paid Subscribers, I took it as a %MAU. Opting for less granularity, I assumed that they follow historic trends and only had a meager increase. The reason for a meager increase is because I believe that consumers taste and preference for subscription remains more or less the same throughout my forecast.  
  
To Forecast Monthly Revenue/Paid subscribers, I’ll assume that the first 2 years the declining trend will continue as management has stated that they “lowered pricing -- prices in several countries to get our prices more in line with each country's GDP per capita.” - Q4 2022 Earnings Conference. After the 2 years, as the economy begins picking up I’ll assume a modest growth in monthly revenue/paid subscribers. And given that DUOL max will be developed and released to a greater extent I’ll assume that this helps the Y/Y as well. Overall Monthly Revenue/Paid Subscribers from 2020 had only a CAGR of 0.8% for my base case which I believe is realistic.  


# COST:

***Cost of Goods Sold***  
DUOL’s 2022 10-K has stated that COGS mainly comes from “third-party payment processing fees charged by various distribution channels”. Apple charges a 30% fee for app purchases. DUOL’s gross margins are slightly above this 30% fee at 73% mainly because there are other revenue sources that circumvent the app store e.g. Advertising. Opting for less granularity I’d forecast gross margins at 70% overtime as DUOL’s revenue sources becomes mainly subscription.   
  
***Operating Cost***  
R&amp;D, the fluctuations in R&amp;D will follow the CapEX cycle of 3 years of being half of historic average and 3 years of ramping up to scale for monetization before tapering off.   
  
Marketing, DUOL has stated that most of their advertisement is organic meaning that they don’t create ad campaigns but rather other users of a social media platform create content about DUOL. I’d assume that DUOL follows historic averages.  
  
G&amp;A, “We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. However, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will remain steady or decrease as a percentage of our revenues as our revenues grow faster than these expenses over the long-term.” - 2022 Q4 10-K. I assume that the nominal amount for G&amp;A grows at a meager rate before holding it constant at the end of the monetization phase.  


# CAPEX:

  
Management wants to capitalize past R&amp;D, “to continue to compound the returns we've seen from our past R&amp;D investments, so we don't plan to hire as many people as we did last year.” - Q4 2022 Earnings Conference. So I'd assume that CapEX has 3 years of being half of historic average and 3 years of ramping up to scale for monetization before becoming capital efficient.  
  


# Change in NWC Schedule:

  
  
***Day A/R and A/P***  
I don’t think that there is much room for DUOL to improve day A/R given that most of their receivables are from the AppStore and PlayStore. And management also has stated their intent to not shift payment methodology off the Stores according to the 2022 Q4 Earnings conference. I assumed the same will happen for Day A/P.  
  
***Deferred Cost of Revenue and Revenue***  
Forecasted as a % of revenue, it’s hard to predict which customers will or will not pay so I opted for less granularity.  


***Others***  
Forecasted as a % of revenue, I opted for less granularity.  


# WACC:

  
***Cost of Equity***  
RFR (1M Avg) = 3.82%  
Market Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DUOL/)) = 0.36  
Earnings Yield (1M Avg) = 3.98%  
S&amp;P 500 (1M Avg) = $4467.72  
Growth Forecast ([SOURCE](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/credit-suisse-ups-sp-500-year-end-forecast-4700-2023-07-18/#:~:text=The%20S%26P%20500%20is%20currently,company%20earnings%20and%20to%20buybacks))  
4050 = (4700 x 3.98%) / (1+R) + (4700 x (1+7%)) x 3.98% / (1+R)\^2 + (5029 x 3.98%) x (1 + 2%) / (R - 2%) / (1+R)\^3  
R = 9.12%   
ERP = 5.30%  
COE = 5.73%  
***Cost of Debt***  
DUOL does not have a bond rating, neither can I use a synthetic rating as DUOL has a negative EBIT. So the best case scenario here is to use management’s discount rate for debt. ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/y2RuXSG))  
COD taken to be 6.92%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21%  
After Tax COD = 5.47%  


Weightage   
Management has broken down operating lease ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/95wZU0H))  
Assuming that 2022 is lease cost is the only interest expense going forward.  
MV Debt = 60.4M   
Average Stock Price (1M Avg) = $123.40  
Shares O/S = 40.6M  
MV Equity = 5010.0M  
%Equity = 98.8%  
%Debt = 1.2%  
WACC = 5.73%  


# SANITY CHECK:

([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/vQV7JAj))  
Worse Case: Subscriber Y/Y 9% CAGR  
Base Case: Subscriber Y/Y 12% CAGR  
Best Case: Subscriber Y/Y 15% CAGR  
Under the base case scenario, DUOL will be reinvesting a very large sum (inclusive of R&amp;D) for below historic ROIC by a significant margin. And I’m assuming a Y/Y CAGR of 12% for subscriber growth compared to 2022’s 40+% Y/Y. I do believe that my assumptions are realistic.  


# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, I value DUOL at $192.29 in my base case. I do believe that management has a clear direction in which they wish to take the firm in and have held true to their belief in AI since the very beginning. I believe that the language learning app is a product where consumers want it to be low maintenance i.e. Logging in daily to continue the streak without having to break the bank. With competitors product having a subscription model it stresses the consumer out having to ""make their moneys worth"".

By posting their &amp;quot;streaks&amp;quot; or achievements e.g. year in review it helps to spread the word for DUOL. &amp;quot;80% of Duolingo’s users were acquired through word of mouth&amp;quot; (&lt;a href=""https://www.adexchanger.com/strategy/organic-marketing-is-duolingos-lingua-franca/""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;REVENUE:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUOL’s management has recognized 2 sources of revenue  (1) “Bookings” and (2) Revenue. The difference is that Bookings represent the total potential revenue that can be collected from subscribers, whereas revenue is when DUOL has actually given the goods and services and can recognize revenue. I believe that in my forecast I should forecast revenue rather than bookings as subscription revenue is not actual revenue in pocket yet, subscribers could cancel at any point of time so I will apply the conservatism principle here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Monthly Active Users(MAU), I’ll use Q4 of each year’s numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Forecast MAU, I believe that DUOL’s subscriber growth trajectory will be similar to other subscription based model e.g. NFLX. They will experience explosive growth followed by mediocre growth as they switch to focusing on monetizing existing MAU. As DUOL has just started catching on, I assume that the high growth period will be 5 years followed by mediocre growth of 2 years before tapering to slow growth for the rest of my forecast. High growth Y/Y was taking historic trends, mediocre and slow growth is taking about half of the previous phase’s Y/Y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Paid Subscribers, I’ll use Q4 of each year’s numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Forecast Paid Subscribers, I took it as a %MAU. Opting for less granularity, I assumed that they follow historic trends and only had a meager increase. The reason for a meager increase is because I believe that consumers taste and preference for subscription remains more or less the same throughout my forecast.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Forecast Monthly Revenue/Paid subscribers, I’ll assume that the first 2 years the declining trend will continue as management has stated that they “lowered pricing -- prices in several countries to get our prices more in line with each country&amp;#39;s GDP per capita.” - Q4 2022 Earnings Conference. After the 2 years, as the economy begins picking up I’ll assume a modest growth in monthly revenue/paid subscribers. And given that DUOL max will be developed and released to a greater extent I’ll assume that this helps the Y/Y as well. Overall Monthly Revenue/Paid Subscribers from 2020 had only a CAGR of 0.8% for my base case which I believe is realistic.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;COST:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cost of Goods Sold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUOL’s 2022 10-K has stated that COGS mainly comes from “third-party payment processing fees charged by various distribution channels”. Apple charges a 30% fee for app purchases. DUOL’s gross margins are slightly above this 30% fee at 73% mainly because there are other revenue sources that circumvent the app store e.g. Advertising. Opting for less granularity I’d forecast gross margins at 70% overtime as DUOL’s revenue sources becomes mainly subscription. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Operating Cost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R&amp;amp;D, the fluctuations in R&amp;amp;D will follow the CapEX cycle of 3 years of being half of historic average and 3 years of ramping up to scale for monetization before tapering off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing, DUOL has stated that most of their advertisement is organic meaning that they don’t create ad campaigns but rather other users of a social media platform create content about DUOL. I’d assume that DUOL follows historic averages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G&amp;amp;A, “We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. However, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will remain steady or decrease as a percentage of our revenues as our revenues grow faster than these expenses over the long-term.” - 2022 Q4 10-K. I assume that the nominal amount for G&amp;amp;A grows at a meager rate before holding it constant at the end of the monetization phase.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CAPEX:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management wants to capitalize past R&amp;amp;D, “to continue to compound the returns we&amp;#39;ve seen from our past R&amp;amp;D investments, so we don&amp;#39;t plan to hire as many people as we did last year.” - Q4 2022 Earnings Conference. So I&amp;#39;d assume that CapEX has 3 years of being half of historic average and 3 years of ramping up to scale for monetization before becoming capital efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Change in NWC Schedule:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Day A/R and A/P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think that there is much room for DUOL to improve day A/R given that most of their receivables are from the AppStore and PlayStore. And management also has stated their intent to not shift payment methodology off the Stores according to the 2022 Q4 Earnings conference. I assumed the same will happen for Day A/P.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deferred Cost of Revenue and Revenue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forecasted as a % of revenue, it’s hard to predict which customers will or will not pay so I opted for less granularity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Others&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

DUOL does not have a bond rating, neither can I use a synthetic rating as DUOL has a negative EBIT. So the best case scenario here is to use management’s discount rate for debt. (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/y2RuXSG""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;

Base Case: Subscriber Y/Y 12% CAGR&lt;br/&gt;
Best Case: Subscriber Y/Y 15% CAGR&lt;br/&gt;
Under the base case scenario, DUOL will be reinvesting a very large sum (inclusive of R&amp;amp;D) for below historic ROIC by a significant margin. And I’m assuming a Y/Y CAGR of 12% for subscriber growth compared to 2022’s 40+% Y/Y. I do believe that my assumptions are realistic.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I value DUOL at $192.29 in my base case. I do believe that management has a clear direction in which they wish to take the firm in and have held true to their belief in AI since the very beginning. I believe that the language learning app is a product where consumers want it to be low maintenance i.e. Logging in daily to continue the streak without having to break the bank. With competitors product having a subscription model it stresses the consumer out having to &amp;quot;make their moneys worth&amp;quot;.    &lt;/p&gt;

94,stocks,"Hey everyone! This post is going to breakdown Netflix. I am going to provide a detailed overview of the company and then find out if it meets our four investment principles (Circle of Competence, Competent Management, MOAT &amp; Margin of Safety). This is a very long post because I want to explain my rationale. This analysis is going to be broken down into four sections:

1. History/Overview of the Company
2. Qualitative Analysis
3. Quantitative Analysis
4. Buy Price

**History of Netflix:**

Netflix launched in 1998 as an online movie rental service. When Netflix began, they offered a subscription package allowing members to rent as many movies as they want for $19.95. The deal was that Netflix subscribers can keep DVDs, up to three at any one time, for as long as they wish. At the time, Netflix's largest competitor was Blockbuster, and funny enough, Netflix offered to sell their business to Blockbuster in 2000 and Blockbuster rejected the deal.This turned out to be a huge mistake for Blockbuster because Netflix forced Blockbuster into bankruptcy. How did Netflix go from offering their business to stealing consumers away from Blockbuster? There are four reasons which I will break down but the overarching answer is that Netflix just offered far more favourable options to consumers at a much lower cost. Let me explain.  
*Better deals:* Subscribers can order a movie online with next-day delivery. Netflix subscribers were able to hold on their DVD as long as they needed without late fees. When it's time to return a movie, a subscriber puts it back into the postage-paid mailers that came with and drops it into a mailbox with no shipping fees.  
*Forward thinking:* Netflix was investing in technology and consumers really liked the personalised recommendations by their software (Netflix recommends titles based on user's previous choices). Brick and Mortar stores like Blockbuster relied on store clerks who knew nothing about their customers' movie tastes.  
*Lower operating costs = better value for consumers:* In 2004, Netflix's logistics systems included only 30 distribution centres throughout the United States. A typical Brick and Mortar store like Blockbuster would take more than 500 video stores to serve the Los Angeles area, while Netflix served the same market with only one warehouse. Because of lower operating costs, Netflix were able to pass on those cost advantages to consumers, offering subscription rental around 50% cheaper than same-store subscription rental.  
*Online streaming:* Netflix invested in online streaming since they recognised that video-on-demand was gaining popularity. Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010.  
**Overview:**

Netflix is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 238 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Netflix is available virtually everywhere except in China and Russia. Members can play, pause, and resume to watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.While consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of “winning moments of truth”. In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.  
**Qualitative Analysis:**

Reed Hastings is currently Chairman of the Board and is the founder of Netflix. Reed Hastings has a history of purchasing Netflix shares indirectly and has a good compensation structure.

There is no doubt that Netflix has a lot of competitors. They compete against linear TV such as broadcast and cable television and other video streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Apple TV, Disney/Hulu, Youtube, HBO. However, Netflix does hold competitive advantages:

* *Linear:* Netflix is much more flexible over linear TV. Netflix is not competing for scarce time-slots whereas linear TV present programs only at particular time. Netflix is on demand, whenever someone wants to watch a show.
* *Netflix produces their own content with their own studio and this is becoming a major source of Netflix:* There is an argument that states Apple and Amazon does the same. Firstly Apple TV is operating at a loss in that segment and is relying on its more profitable lines to make up for that segment. Amazon Prime recently started operating at a profit however there are a few things worth noting.

1. Amazon Prime memberships are available in only 27 countries, whereas Netflix is available in over 190 countries. Furthermore, Amazon is very diversified so they have a limited focus, whereas Netflix's only focus is providing entertainment to consumers.
2. Netflix has a successful track record of producing local stories to reflect the different tastes in different countries and made them available and popular worldwide. Think of Netflix originals such as Money Heist (Spain), Squid Game (South Korea), Alice In wonderland (Tokyo, Japan). Without Netflix, a lot of international series and movies would have never achieved global penetration.  

3. Netflix original films bypasses the Cinemas and Netflix gets original access: This also makes Netflix a competitor to theatres, except that theatres have limited seats and time slots, Netflix does not.
4. Furthermore, Netflix licenses from other studios in the first pay TV window (the ""pay one"" window). This means Netflix gets first access after theatrical release of licensed content. Pay-one movies debut very well after theatrical release with a lot of viewership and Netflix has the ability to carry the film for 18-24 months. The result: Netflix has more viewing time than their competitors.

**Quantitative Analysis:**

Although Netflix has a bigger market share compared to other streaming platforms (some countries Youtube has the lead), Netflix market share is just under 10% so there is still significant room to grow.

This is where it is important to pay attention when it comes down to valuing Netflix. At first glance, it looks like membership growth is decelerating from 20% growth to under 10%. However, there are a couple things to consider.

* Last year, Netflix stock price plummeted due to losing memberships in Q1 and Q2. When Netflix reported losing -0.2 million subscribers in Q1, this was because they withdrew there services from Russia that resulted in a -0.7million impact on paid net adds; therefore, excluding this impact, paid net add would have been +0.5m.
* At the time, Netflix just announced paid sharing and there was a lot of initial negative reaction with consumers deleting their Netflix accounts. However, this turned out to be temporary and Netflix subscriber growth quickly improved after that. (One thing to keep in mind is this: *20 years ago, people were paying $5 for a single new rental DVD release, and around $60 for cable. Back then, the general cost of goods and services aren't anywhere like it is today due to inflation*. ***People will always pay for entertainment, so Netflix paid sharing impact on subscriber growth was always going to temporary.***
* Netflix has entered into the advertising business and so far it is proving to be successful. Consumers are benefitting because of lower price points, Netflix is benefiting because of increased subscriber growth and the advertising segment has better margins.  
How did I calculate Free Cash Flow?

Netflix pays a substantial amount each year for content and it is hard to determine what portion of that content spend is considered maintenance capital expenditure and what portion is considered growth capital expenditure. To make this process easy, I have calculated free cash flow by taking:

* Cash Flow from operations + Additions to Content Assets - Amortization of content Assets - Purchases of Property &amp; Equipment = Free Cash Flow.  
I also believe that this is a conservative estimate of Free Cash Flow because amortisation is on an accelerated basis. Over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is amortised within 4 years after it first becomes available. There are tax laws preventing management from speeding up depreciation of tangible property but since intangible assets such as content is extremely difficult to measure, management can speed up the amortization process. ***Management is incentivised to do this because a higher amortization expense (which is a non-cash expense) reduces the amount of taxes Netflix has to pay!***  


**BUY PRICE:** 

If you made it this far in the post then congratulations. My buy price ranges from ***$182 to around $250***. I have used the discount cash flow calculator using the current year free cash flow (2022). The former assumes a growth rate of 15% with a 15% discount rate. The latter assumes a growth rate of 10% with a 10% discount rate. I missed out on a bargain last year but I only began looking into Netflix a few weeks ago.  
I'll end this analysis with this quote.

&lt;p&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;
This is where it is important to pay attention when it comes down to valuing Netflix. At first glance, it looks like membership growth is decelerating from 20% growth to under 10%. However, there are a couple things to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last year, Netflix stock price plummeted due to losing memberships in Q1 and Q2. When Netflix reported losing -0.2 million subscribers in Q1, this was because they withdrew there services from Russia that resulted in a -0.7million impact on paid net adds; therefore, excluding this impact, paid net add would have been +0.5m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the time, Netflix just announced paid sharing and there was a lot of initial negative reaction with consumers deleting their Netflix accounts. However, this turned out to be temporary and Netflix subscriber growth quickly improved after that. (One thing to keep in mind is this: &lt;em&gt;20 years ago, people were paying $5 for a single new rental DVD release, and around $60 for cable. Back then, the general cost of goods and services aren&amp;#39;t anywhere like it is today due to inflation&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People will always pay for entertainment, so Netflix paid sharing impact on subscriber growth was always going to temporary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netflix has entered into the advertising business and so far it is proving to be successful. Consumers are benefitting because of lower price points, Netflix is benefiting because of increased subscriber growth and the advertising segment has better margins.&lt;br/&gt;
How did I calculate Free Cash Flow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix pays a substantial amount each year for content and it is hard to determine what portion of that content spend is considered maintenance capital expenditure and what portion is considered growth capital expenditure. To make this process easy, I have calculated free cash flow by taking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash Flow from operations + Additions to Content Assets - Amortization of content Assets - Purchases of Property &amp;amp; Equipment = Free Cash Flow.&lt;br/&gt;
I also believe that this is a conservative estimate of Free Cash Flow because amortisation is on an accelerated basis. Over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is amortised within 4 years after it first becomes available. There are tax laws preventing management from speeding up depreciation of tangible property but since intangible assets such as content is extremely difficult to measure, management can speed up the amortization process. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Management is incentivised to do this because a higher amortization expense (which is a non-cash expense) reduces the amount of taxes Netflix has to pay!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY PRICE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far in the post then congratulations. My buy price ranges from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;$182 to around $250&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I have used the discount cash flow calculator using the current year free cash flow (2022). The former assumes a growth rate of 15% with a 15% discount rate. The latter assumes a growth rate of 10% with a 10% discount rate. I missed out on a bargain last year but I only began looking into Netflix a few weeks ago.&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll end this analysis with this quote.&lt;br/&gt;

During Q2 plce, cri, and gil sales had decreased, but were better than expected. PLCE stated that sales were better due to strong e commerce, and unexpected early back to school shopping; which are two things GPS is capable of experiencing too. In Q1, both gps and plce expected the consumer to be wearker, however retail sales data was not bad. PLCE also guided for better margins in Q3 because of decreasing cotton and shipping prices, layoffs, and reduced inventory.  
  
  
GPS is also getting a new CEO, who was previously the COO at MAT. However this isnt a regular reshuffling of the execs, as GPS hasnt had a designated CEO since July 2022. If they don't manage to deliver with their financials, the guidance of finally getting a permanent CEO should be great.

101,stocks,"Is anyone else surprised that san francisco approved driverless taxis in the city??? I thought this would take years for regulations to pass


Anyways this is good news for tesla right? it looks like San Francisco might be the starting/testing ground for teslas robotaxi

For fun

Let's run through some rough numbers here, I'll probably be wrong on most of this

Right now uber drivers make 25-35 an hr on average in SF.

With tesla, they'll probably charge half that,  so let's say 15$ an hr.

People will be lending their cars out for robotaxi and tesla can supply their own cars too, but let's say people volunteer their tesla 

If tesla takes a 50% cut, that's 7.50 an hr, let's say they operate for 12 hrs a day


Well go with Roughly 10,000 teslas roaming around SF giving rides 

10,000 teslas giving rides for 12hrs a day at 7.50 an hr equates to about 

300 mill in a year Roughly in net profit. Not bad for 1 city.



At that rate it's most likely going well,  so it'll be approved slowly around the country, so maybe 50 cities 

Multiply 300 mil by 50, you have 16 bil in net profit which should raise marketcap by 160 to 300 bil

Oh and uber will most likely be doomed in the process as this is pretty much their core business.


This is a rough guess and estimate , tesla might change the numbers around in terms of profit sharing

106,stocks,"BP is a dividend-growing stock that is moving towards renewable energy while continuing to produce oil and gas. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the pandemic have affected the company's fundamentals, but they are stabilising and exhibiting growth potential. Due to its low valuation and strong dividend and buyback programme, BP makes an appealing investment. 

  
Although the corporation recognises that renewable energy sources hold great promise for the future of energy, it also takes advantage of business opportunities in the oil and gas industry. The corporation invests substantially in LNG (liquified natural gas), one of the most significant potential, and it will gain more notoriety as Europe stops importing natural gas from Russian pipelines. As Europe switches to renewable energy, BP can support the continent's gas demand.  
Across the board, BP is significantly investing in renewable energy. For customers waiting for their autos, it makes investments in EV (electric vehicle) charging stations and convenience stores. The fuels of the future, hydrogen and biofuels, are also investments. While hydrogen is clean, primarily green hydrogen, biofuels are carbon neutral. Having access to new green fuels and charging infrastructure will put BP in a good position going forward. Electricity will be used for transportation, and hydrogen and biofuels will be used in industries.

  
A recession is a significant risk for energy industries. During recessions, expenditure declines, which lowers demand for fuel and energy. Now that the economy must deal with rising rates, which decrease investments and spending, there is a possibility of a slump. The EPS of BP will be adversely impacted in the near and medium term if the world experiences a recession.  
The oil and gas sector, which makes up the majority of BP, will remain unchanged over the next few decades. The business also hopes to expand by making investments in brand-new areas related to renewable energy and green electricity. The corporation doesn't have the same advantage it does in oil and gas because it lacks knowledge in these areas.

I've come to the conclusion that TA is reasonably good at predicting where a stock will go, at least good enough to narrow down which stocks are worth looking at. but it seems to be pretty bad at finding good entry points. 

So I'm starting to dive into chart patterns to try to find those good entry points. I'm worried that by looking at a chart long enough, I'll find patterns that aren't really there. 

Two that I'm looking at now are $CAT and $NWS. CAT looks like it's about to break out from a falling wedge. NWS might be a flag? But the period right after the pole seems unusual and the flag has dropped down a lot. 

What do y'all make of these charts? And just more generally, any advice on reading chart patterns would be nice. I'm kinda scepticle about them. I'd think if they were very reliable everyone would spot them and play off of that, it seems to easy. Does anyone here trade chart patterns successfully?


edit: ok, so this sub really doesn't like TA or chart patterns. Message received. I'm just doing paper trading for now so I'm going to test it myself and see how it goes.

I&amp;#39;ve come to the conclusion that TA is reasonably good at predicting where a stock will go, at least good enough to narrow down which stocks are worth looking at. but it seems to be pretty bad at finding good entry points. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m starting to dive into chart patterns to try to find those good entry points. I&amp;#39;m worried that by looking at a chart long enough, I&amp;#39;ll find patterns that aren&amp;#39;t really there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two that I&amp;#39;m looking at now are $CAT and $NWS. CAT looks like it&amp;#39;s about to break out from a falling wedge. NWS might be a flag? But the period right after the pole seems unusual and the flag has dropped down a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

Sure its small term pain knowing that certain projects are on hold. There is a lot of content in the coffers that they can still continue to produce without additional writing.

Most of the major studios also have other revenue streams that power them through. Let's just take Disney to start. They have $8.3B coming in from parks. They have $5.5B coming in from Streaming. They have 1.9 Billion coming in from cord deals.

Look at Comcast, they have Peacock streamers, they have their existing cable business, they have their internet business (mixed with cable subscribers), they have their mobile unit.. they have plenty to keep powering their way through.

Then you have weird companies like Apple and Amazon who can take virtual losses forever in entertainment and not care. Netflix is weird because of all its custom content but has a massive catalog of back content to keep subscribers happy for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

What stocks to look at are the ones that rely only on content to stay alive. Those are the companies to be paying attention too. For instance I'd be very interested in how Warner Bro's/Discovery are going to be doing.  I'd also look at Sony who owes a lot to their entertainment divisions for profits (sure they do electronics and niche other areas), but they own some of the larger studios.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't want to make this a political topic but the Writers guild really needs to re-think their leverage. Sure the major studio's wont have new content coming out and already put a massive backlog and delays to projects. The major studios now are conglomerates that own so many other businesses they can keep moving along. They also don't realize that these studios will keep generating revenue but don't have to pay any of the writers, actors, production, etc... they have a freeze on money coming in but also a freeze on money going out.  The problem with industry consolidation + multi-faceted businesses is you lose your negotiating leverage.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear other peoples thoughts on this. What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

Especially their fear of AI As they know will becoming after their jobs. Netflix already was using it to determine what  shows and themes would be the most productive for returns. Disney/ILM started using it to replace opening credits. Disney even hired the group that for the end of Mando Season 2 were Luke showed up, another group of people showed they could do a better Deep Fake and they hired them. If I'm not mistaken Netflix used AI to write one of black mirrors episodes.

AI is coming and I can see why writers are so fearful. People are so naive on the idea that AI is coming for jobs even creative.

&amp;#x200B;

If anything I'd love to hear from people some of the VFX studios if they are public? That would be were I would start putting money into. Ones that are progressive and have a massive catalogue. It sucks ILM is private (Disney owned), Pixar (Disney Owned), Dreamworks, etc.

I wish Epic which powers the majority of games but also the Volume that is used in almost all new TV productions.... was public but they are private for now.

**At the end of the day the stocks to pay attention to are:**

The Chips Needed to Make these: Intel, Nvidia, AMD

The Companies that specialize in building AI  Model with datasets: OpenAI (Microsoft), Google, Facebook, ByteDance, etc.

&lt;p&gt;I wish Epic which powers the majority of games but also the Volume that is used in almost all new TV productions.... was public but they are private for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end of the day the stocks to pay attention to are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fabs that produce them: TSCM, Samsung, Intel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are companies producing the software: Epic, Blender, Unity. Adobe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Streaming Services: Netflix, Disney+, Max (Warner Bros) -- then you have youtube material being turned into its own streaming service like Curiositystream Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Companies that specialize in building AI  Model with datasets: OpenAI (Microsoft), Google, Facebook, ByteDance, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royalty Companies: Dolby, IMAX&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then there are the host of startups creating custom chips for these tasks (ASICS), newer software, and existing VFX studios who know how to power them all. Which is where the money will be for future stocks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

ENERGY TRANSFER TO ACQUIRE CRESTWOOD IN A $7.1 BILLION ALL-EQUITY TRANSACTION 08/16/2023 DALLAS &amp; HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET) (“Energy Transfer”) and Crestwood Equity Partners LP (NYSE: CEQP) (“Crestwood”) announced today that the parties have entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Energy Transfer will acquire Crestwood in an all-equity transaction valued at approximately $7.1 billion, including the assumption of $3.3 billion of debt, based on the closing price on August 15, 2023.

Under the terms of the agreement, Crestwood common unitholders will receive 2.07 Energy Transfer common units for each Crestwood common unit. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023, subject to the approval of Crestwood’s unitholders, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. Upon closing, Crestwood common unitholders are expected to own approximately 6.5% of Energy Transfer’s outstanding common units.

Complementary Assets

Crestwood’s system includes gathering and processing assets located in the Williston, Delaware and Powder River basins, including approximately 2.0 billion cubic feet per day of gas gathering capacity, 1.4 billion cubic feet per day of gas processing capacity and 340 thousand barrels per day of crude gathering capacity. If consummated, this transaction would extend Energy Transfer’s position in the value chain deeper into the Williston and Delaware basins while also providing entry into the Powder River basin. These assets are expected to complement Energy Transfer’s downstream fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu, as well as its hydrocarbon export capabilities from both its Nederland Terminal in Texas and the Marcus Hook Terminal in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

This transaction is also expected to provide benefits to Energy Transfer’s NGL &amp; Refined Products and Crude Oil businesses with the addition of strategically located storage and terminal assets, including approximately 10 million barrels of storage capacity, as well as trucking and rail terminals. These systems are anchored by predominantly investment-grade producer customers with firm, long-term contracts, and significant acreage dedications.

Positive Financial Impact

The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to distributable cash flow per unit as well as neutral to Energy Transfer’s leverage metrics upon closing. Similar to Energy Transfer, Crestwood’s cash flows are supported by primarily fee-based revenues from long-term contracts with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, with the increased scale and strengthened balance sheet, Energy Transfer expects to be able to improve on the current cost of financing for the acquired debt securities. Structured as a 100% unit-for-unit exchange, the transaction is tax-efficient to Crestwood unitholders and is anticipated to position both partnerships for long-term value upside through the combination.

Energy Transfer also expects to achieve at least $40 million of annual run-rate cost synergies before additional benefits of financial and commercial opportunities.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.crestwoodlp.com/investors/news/news-details/2023/Energy-Transfer-to-Acquire-Crestwood-in-a-7.1-Billion-All-Equity-Transaction/default.aspx""&gt;ENERGY TRANSFER TO ACQUIRE CRESTWOOD IN A $7.1 BILLION ALL-EQUITY TRANSACTION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm asking so many questions because you bears are the apparent winners here.

Now I realize that the FED is steamrolling inflation to 2% and they're hell bent on achieving that sooner than later, so companies won't be borrowing at these high costs anymore and growth will slow.

So stocks most likely will correct too, I see QQQ going lower to like $330 or even $300 in an over correction.

The UOL Group CEO and Principal Executive Officer of PagBank Ricardo Dutra,is the former PagBank CEO (2016-2022) is a part of the UOL Group for 26 years and is a MBA.&lt;br/&gt;
The PagBank Ceo&lt;br/&gt;
Alexandre Magnai is the CEO of Pagbank since 2022 and was in the organization since 2015, before that, he spent 15 years at Mastercard leading their latin american regional new business development and retailer issuers initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;
PagBank is the second largest neo bank in brazil,with its client base growing quintuple-fold in the last 4 years,its credit portfolio growing sevenfold,and total deposits growing tenfold.&lt;br/&gt;
Its payment platform grew from 1 to 11 percent market share in the last 7 years,with 354 R$ Billion TPV in 2022.&lt;br/&gt;
In Brazil, only 55% of population 15+ use credit cards, in comparison to Countries like the US,UK and canada with 88% 93% and 97%,therefore the room for growth is very large.&lt;br/&gt;
Pagbank shows consistent growth,with 40% y/y outperforming the industry’s 25%, with e commerce being only 15% of total retail in brazil and PCE expected to reach 70% in 2025, PagBank growth potential is further solidified.&lt;br/&gt;
Since Lula was elected in brazil (January first) brazil 10 Year T Bill Interest Rate went down 13%,inflation rate dropped below 4% for the first time since october 2020 and the brazilian Real went up 10% against the dollar, if the economy continues to go along this trend, brazil spending power will increase and as a result the tpv and revenue of PagBank.&lt;br/&gt;
The newly presented 300 Billion $R PAC initiative is planned to create affordable housing and to advance the economy,and while the full bill wasn&amp;#39;t unveiled yet and corruption is a viable concern, the initiative could very well help the company to grow .&lt;br/&gt;
Comparing the key financial ratios of PagBank, to 3 similar companies : Nu Bank(NU),Paypal(PYPL) and Block Inc.(SQ),PagBank has the lowest forward p/e,p/s, p/b, and debt to equity, in addition , it has the second largest net profit margin and largest operational margin.&lt;br/&gt;
The main risk factor in the company is its location,brazil is notoriously corrupt and the current president was involved in corruption scandals before, if brazil economy goes down so does PagBank.&lt;/p&gt;

154,stocks,"* Eight months after 2023 kicked off with widespread recession calls across Wall Street, the Atlanta Fed is projecting the economy will grow nearly 6% in the third quarter.

On Tuesday, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow estimate moved up to 5.8% from 5.0% a day prior after fresh data from the Census Bureau's showed housing starts increased 3.9%. in June. If the 5.8% GDP growth number held, it'd mark the most robust period of economic growth since the fourth quarter of 2021.

The higher projection from the Atlanta Fed is the latest piece of data pointing to a stronger than expected US economy. On Tuesday, July's retail sales report revealed sales increased 0.7% in the month with the control group, which contributes directly to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), rising 1.0%. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected just a 0.5% increase for the control group.

The upbeat print on the consumer came after recent jobs data showed the economy is still adding jobs while unemployment remains historically low and monthly wage growth has begun to outpace inflation, providing a potential boost for further consumer spending.

&gt;We're halfway through Q3 and the Atlanta Fed Q3 GDP Nowcast is tracking at +5.8% growth 😳 Residential investment (included in Private Investment), is now expected to add to GDP growth for the first time in a while, while Consumer Spending is chugging along. pic.twitter.com/RrQSlQEQvI
&gt;— Liz Young (@LizYoungStrat)

2023 has been marked by upward revisions to economic growth. An initial reading for first quarter GDP of 1.1% was boosted to 2.0%. The first reading of second quarter GDP came in hotter than expected, too. A 2.4% reading in late July, revealed the economy grew at a faster pace in the second quarter.

The growth has become so robust to the upside that some economists are now beginning to question if the positive data could be detrimental to recent improvements on the inflation front.

""While good news for the near-term real GDP growth outlook (Q3 is likely to print at least 2% annualize and probably stronger), the resilience of the US consumer complicates the picture for the Fed,"" Citi US economics research analyst Gisela Hoxha wrote in a note on Tuesday after the release of the retail sales report. ""Upside surprises to demand for goods mean increasing upside risk to prices for a category of inflation that has been reliably soft this year.""

Still, Thursday's upgrade to the GDPNow forecast comes just midway through the third quarter with a substantial amount of data before the quarter closes at the end of September.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to address the state of the economy and the fight against inflation during the 2023 Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole which begins on August 24.

Per minutes from the Fed's July meeting released on Wednesday, central bank officials still view inflation as ""unacceptably high."" Most officials said they see still significant upside risks to inflation.

""Participants continued to view a period of below-trend growth in real GDP and some softening in labor market conditions as needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and reduce inflation pressures sufficiently to return inflation to 2 percent over time,"" the minutes read.

Hai Di Lao is the most popular hotpot restaurant in China and most of Asia. It's known for the extraordinary customer service and extremely cordial atmosphere. However, it may be tough to continue achieving the impressive Y/Y growth that HDL is used to due to a few reasons such as lack of clear management guidance, tough margins and the nature of the business.  


# Investment Thesis 1:

***Lack of Clear Management Guidance***  


Due to Covid-19, HDL's management had to strategically close down stores. Management recognizes the need to be more conservative and has laid out the ""Woodpecker"" plan. The plan is to close business that (1) have low customer traffic due to a lack of established business district, (2) Unsatisfactory performance (3) Areas with high HDL density.   
But beyond this plan, management did not lay out any other plans going forward. This opacity makes it hard to maintain confidence in management and whether they are steering the ship in the right direction or into an ice berg. With their earnings report usually laying out very vague plans on using technology to enhance the experience for customers or describing R&amp;D with very low barriers to entry.  


# Investment Thesis 2:

***Tough Margins***  


The Unique Selling Point (USP) for HDL may turn out to be a double edged sword. With very strong economic incentive to motivate employees, the margins for HDL may be significantly lower than other restaurants. This problem is temporarily buoyed by the weak housing market in China that allows HDL to buff their margins with very cheap rent. However, the areas for HDL to shave margins are low. This means that HDL's only other way of improving margins is to improve revenue through charging an even larger premium. However, I'm skeptical of whether HDL is able to do that or not as HDL is still a restaurant chain it is not an established restaurant that can command a very high premium.  


# Investment Thesis 3:

***Nature of  the Business***  


HDL's business model is that they would have a very interactive waiting areas e.g. Customers can fold paper cranes while waiting for their table to reduce their final bill. The longer the customers wait, the hungrier they get and the more food they will order. However, this also means that opening up restaurant has negative within firm externality. Customers could choose to simply head to another nearby outlet which is less crowded, which means that opening new restaurants may yield declining ROIC overtime. With the strong 996 culture in China, it may also mean that the restaurant business becomes less viable as customers have lesser time and patience for Hot Pot.   
The room for innovation in the hot pot restaurant isn't a lot and this lack of innovation may severely limit the potential margins for HDL.  


# Revenue:

I've assumed that HDL will carry out its Woodpecker plan for 2 years before proceeding back into growth mode for 5 years before slowing its pace of growth. Revenue/Restaurant will also increase as I assume that due to HDL closing down less effective stores and gaining even more brand goodwill the prices it can charge will increase as well.   


Forecasting number of restaurants to be opened, I followed historic Y/Y trends and overall had a CAGR of restaurants opened at 3%.

Forecasting Revenue/Restaurant, given that less effective restaurants are shuttered I’d assume that revenue/restaurant increases back to 2021 level by the end of the woodpecker plan before decreasing in the expansion years. And in perpetuity holding at higher than pre covid levels.  


Delivery pegged as a %restaurants, rationale being that as the business performs well the goodwill of HDL will carry, improving customer loyalty. Even though more restaurants may mean more convenience to just eat at the restaurant, due to China’s 996 culture it may not be a feasible option, so I purely consider this under the rationale of HDL’s goodwill improving.  
  
Same with the sale of condiments, the main reason for condiments to be sold is because of the strong goodwill for HDL and consumer’s trust in the quality of HDL so I’ve opted for less granularity. (You don’t see HDL advertising their condiments, and mainly sell in their own HDL stores, not supermarkets.)  


Revenue Model: \[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/VK6DiuU)\]  


# COST:

**RENT EXPENSE**  
Rent is significantly cheaper now than 2018 levels because of a myriad of reasons (1) During the property craze before China's 3 red lines was established there was a large influx of funds for property ([SOURCE](http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/PressRelease/202001/t20200119_1723643.html)) leading to supply of properties to increase drastically. (2) The collapse of Evergrande led to demand for property investment cooling off.   
I’d argue that this depressed rent cannot last forever, given that Rent Expense as a % of revenue went from 4% in 2018 to 0.9% in 2022. I’d assume that amount will bounce back to about 2.5%. However, that timing may take a very long while as defaulted property developers have to finish their development and it takes time to rebuild confidence. So I’d assume it takes about 10 years to bounce back to 2.5%.  
  
**STAFF COST &amp; RAW MATERIAL**  
From 2019 - 2021, as HDL was aggressively growing they did not manage their variable cost effectively so their Staff Cost &amp; Raw Material as a % of Revenue started ballooning. I believe at the end of the “woodpecker” plan these costs as a % of Revenue will drop back down to 2018 levels as HDL more effectively manages these costs. During the expansion plan, these costs will balloon back up to 2021 levels before dropping back down to even lower than 2018 as HDL now enjoys a significant amount of Economies of Scale.  
  
**OTHERS**  
Assumed to be a %revenue and opted for less granularity, forecasting it based on historical trends.

1. Tax Rate at 25% for my entire forecast.
2. There is no Cannibalistic Externality for opening up new restaurants.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, I value HDL at RMB$12.55. I believe that my valuation differing from market's valuation could potentially be due to the opacity in Management's future plans. The Market may be more optimistic in how long they believe ""Woodpecker"" plan will last for and how high the growth of HDL can be. The optimism could also stem from the belief that Hot Pot will become more popular in other parts of the world, this international expansion was one aspect which I did not consider in my DCF.

&lt;h2&gt;Daily Buy &amp;amp; Sell Strategy Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Excel file contains an analysis of the best days to buy and sell for a set of stocks based on historical data. The strategy involves buying the stock on the day of the week when it has the lowest average return and selling it on the day when it has the highest average return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Columns:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symbol: The ticker symbol or identifier for the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buy Day: The day of the week when the stock typically has its lowest average return, making it the best day to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sell Day: The day of the week when the stock typically has its highest average return, making it the best day to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total Gain or Loss ($): The net gain or loss in dollars if one had followed the strategy of buying on the &amp;quot;Buy Day&amp;quot; and selling on the &amp;quot;Sell Day&amp;quot; for the entire period of historical data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days with a Gain: The number of transactions (buy &amp;amp; sell pairs) that resulted in a gain..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days with a Loss: The number of transactions (buy &amp;amp; sell pairs) that resulted in a loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days of Data: The total number of days of data available for the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notes:
The strategy assumes a fixed investment amount ($1,000) for each buy transaction.
The &amp;quot;Total Gain or Loss ($)&amp;quot; column considers all gains and losses from each buy-sell pair to arrive at a net result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

164,stocks,"Longer DD with many numbers, all data from 10-Qs for Q2 2023 or 2022

 Interest Income increases its share of total revenue, given large portfolio expansions (+33% loan principal, +108% interest bearing assets), slightly higher NII. Non-interest income, however, seems more organically grown. Except the line “Loan origination and sales” (used to be 43% of net revenue in H1 2022, of which 70%), which captures fair value adjustments of loans originated or held in the relevant period, as well as gains on sales. In H1 2023, Gains on sales were aggregate $6.34m, while on page 17 cumulative fair value adjustments were shown as $260m (difference in cumulated fair value adjustments Dec-22, Jun-23) in the same period. There is another table on p 35, which indicates that impact on earnings of those adjustments were also captured in “interest income” and others were $91m for loans and $115m in total for the same period. These numbers don’t add up – where does the rest come from? Interestingly, despite way higher sales volume in 2022, gains were actually down quite a bit, despite them suffering some losses selling home loans in 22.

**Business Model problems:**

A large part of SoFis valuation is the unplanned high interest income, which is generated by forcefully holding loans for longer terms on the balance sheet (sales volume plummeted 86% yoy). The high percentage of charge-offs (3% on personal loans (1.25% in 2022) and 18% for credit cards (11.4% in 2022)) shows that underlying loan quality can’t possibly be that great. Most likely, those unsecured loans were advanced for refinancing (credit cards, pay now pay later, etc.) debt which very well can become toxic should financial conditions continue to tighten or economic conditions to start shifting. BAC’s credit card segment shows &lt;1% charge-off rates on 10.68% yield, which is bizarrely lower than SoFi’s personal loans. For comparison, BAC’s yield on personal/consumer loans was a mere 4.35% in H1 2023. Given those circumstances, one might wonder how shitty those loans actually are…

  
 What’s more, the market currently thinks that the re-commencement of student loan repayments is going to boost SoFi’s business, as many previously federal borrowers are going to refi with them. Just two problems; first, SoFi currently earns on average 4.93% interest on student loans. Given that SOFR and now 2yr treasuries are already at 5%, this should mean that fair value adjustments of student loans should actually be negative, when they aren't on their balance sheet. Compare that to SLM, which charges 7% on federally backed loans, and 10%+ on average on private loans (Maybe SoFi's loan quality is better or the originated more during pandemic years, but they hardly offer any data on their borrowers - which SLM does). Moreover, SoFi leverages approximately half its student loans via warehousing at a 564-691 bps rate, which does not make sense whatsoever. The only explanation is, that they have a very segregated portfolio of highly yielding (prop. 9%+) risky loans and a few high-quality low yielding ones, otherwise back-leveraging does not really make sense at higher borrowing costs than yields. Noted, that they’ve reduced their drawable commitment and got that facility probably in 0% SOFR times. But even if assumed, that the other half is funded by deposits costing 3.8-4.6 %, they really don’t make any money. Looking ahead, funding costs (warehouse and deposits) are likely to keep increasing at least for a year, while chargeable interest rates on student loans will be effectively capped by a 5.5% federal rate for eligible people. One might argue, ""Well what about falling rates, having loans yielding 4.9% is then really good"", well they're all going to refinance, same old problem back when we had wonderful CDOs etc.

What‘s your thoughts on this - currently have no exposure, because I don‘t really know whether the above is actually valid.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer DD with many numbers, all data from 10-Qs for Q2 2023 or 2022&lt;/p&gt;

While regulatory worries and extreme volatility continue to make equities dangerous, numerous analysts remain optimistic about the market. Comparison Toolsa are used to compare Coinbase Global ($COIN), Marathon Digital ($MARA), and Riot Platforms ($RIOT) to determine the most appealing mining stock.

# Coinbase Global ($COIN):

Coinbase Global has faced increased regulatory scrutiny, with the SEC suing the company for selling unregistered securities. Despite these issues, Coinbase shares have rallied by 128% this year. The company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, with revenue declining 12.4% to $708 million, but exceeding analysts' expectations. The loss per share narrowed to $0.42, better than analysts' expectation of $0.76. Lower costs and a surge in interest income contributed to the bottom line. However, investors were disappointed with the sequential decline in Q2 2023 trading volumes and the company's Q3 2023 guidance for subscriptions and services. Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley raised his price target for Coinbase to $80, maintaining a Hold rating. Wall Street is sidelined on COIN stock, with a Hold consensus rating based on six Buys, eight Holds, and eight Sells. The average price target of $80.68 suggests the stock could be range bound from current levels.

# Marathon Digital Holdings ($MARA):

Marathon Digital reported a Q2 2023 revenue surge of $81.8 million, driven by a 314% increase in Bitcoin production. This growth narrowed the reported loss per share to $0.13 from $1.94 in the previous quarter. However, the company also highlighted impressive growth in its hash rate and efficiency, with a 54% increase to 17.7 Exahashes per second (EH/s) in Q2 2023 compared to the first quarter. The company is targeting an operational hash rate of 23 EH/s through its new facilities in Ellendale, North Dakota and Garden City, Texas. Compass Point analyst Chase White reduced his price target for Marathon Digital to $20 from $21 and reiterated a Buy rating. With two Buys and two Holds, Marathon Digital scores a Moderate Buy consensus rating, with an average price target of $16.50, implying a 10% upside. Shares have jumped over 338% year-to-date.

# Riot Platforms ($RIOT):

Riot Platforms, a major Bitcoin miner in North America, has seen a strong rebound from last year's slump due to Bitcoin price increases and its expansion. The company reported mixed results for Q2 2023, with a lower-than-anticipated loss per share and a 27% increase in Bitcoin production. Roth MKM analyst Darren Aftahi reiterated a Buy rating on RIOT stock and raised the price target to $19.50. The company's Q2 2023 results showed a 19% reduction in mining costs and $13.5 million in power credits, which could improve efficiency in the second half of the year. Aftahi believes Riot Platforms has the potential to triple its hash rate from 10.7 EH/s to 35 EH/s by the end of 2025. The stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on eight unanimous Buys, with an average price target of $20.19, indicating 38% upside potential. Shares have risen over 332% since the start of this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Wall Street is positive on Riot Platforms but bearish on Coinbase and cautiously hopeful on Marathon Digital. Despite a great year-to-date performance, experts expect Riot Platforms stock to rise much more. Nonetheless, before making any investing decisions, investors should examine the significant risks and volatility connected with equities.

In recent weeks I saw a lot of posts regarding PayPal. Often there was answers like „why would you buy PayPal over Visa, Mastercard or Amex?“.

I'm looking at ASML at a potential stock and try to find a fair value to see if the current price is undervalued or overvalued.

Based on its Free Cash Flow (FCF) between 2014-2022, I obtain a CARGO of around 30%, and an average growth of 45%. As per finviz estimates an EPS growth of around 20% over the next 5 years.

Considering a growth rate of 18% over the next 10 years, a discount (WAAC) rate of 10%, I obtain a fair value $700, so its current price of $660 means it is undervalued.

However, I mean I remember that ASML stated that they expect some headwinds for the rest of the year, so I'm considering to DCA into the stock when it hits around $630.

Consumer spending held up well in July as inflation slowed, with retail sales turning in a stronger than expected showing for the month, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.  
  
The advanced retail sales report showed a seasonally adjusted increase of 0.7% for the month, better than the 0.4% Dow Jones estimate. Excluding autos, sales rose a robust 1%, also against a 0.4% forecast. Both readings were the best monthly gains since January.  
  
As the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, they showed a consumer able to keep ahead of price increases that have been prevalent over the past two years. The consumer price index rose 0.2% on the month, indicating solid demand.  
  
July’s numbers were boosted by a 1.9% jump in spending at online retailers, while sporting goods and related stores increased 1.5% and food service and drinking places rose 1.4%.  
  
On the downside, furniture sales slumped 1.8% and electronics and appliance stores reported a 1.3% drop. Gas station sales rose just 0.4% on the month despite rising prices at the pump.  
  
The report adds to the narrative that the U.S. economy may be able to avoid a much-predicted recession brought on by a series of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes aimed at controlling inflation.  
  
In a series of 11 increases since March 2022, the central bank has taken up its key borrowing rate by 5.25 percentage points to hits highest level in more than 22 years. Regardless, consumers, who power about two-thirds of the entire $26.8 trillion U.S. economy, have persevered.  
  
As saving has begun to dry up, shoppers have shown a willingness to use credit cards, the balances of which exceeded $1 trillion for the first time in the second quarter of 2023.  
  
July’s data showed that spending was widespread, with most categories showing increases. However, motor vehicle sales fell 0.3% as well. On a 12-month basis, sales rose 3.2%, which is exactly in line with the annual increase in the CPI.  
  
A separate report Tuesday, however, showed that inflation pressures linger after hitting their highest level in more than 40 years in the summer of 2022.  
  
Import prices move 0.4% higher in July, higher than the 0.2% estimate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was only the second monthly gain in 2023, as the year-over-year rate declined 4.4%. A year ago, the annual increase was 8.8%.  
  
Virtually all of the increase came from a 3.6% rise in imported fuel prices. Import prices were unchanged when excluding fuel, according to the BLS.  
  
Export prices, though, rose even more, gaining 0.7% on the month. However, they are down 7.9% from a year ago, after surging 12.9% from July 2021 to July 2022.  
  
An additional report Tuesday presented another mixed bag of data.  
  
The Empire State Manufacturing Survey, which gauges activity in the New York region, slumped 20 points in August to a reading of -19. That represents the difference between companies reporting expansion against contraction, and was much lower than the -1.4 Dow Jones estimate.  
  
New orders and shipments dropped sharply on the month, while prices paid and received both moved considerably higher.  
  
Despite the poor August reading, the index for future business conditions, which measures expectations six months out, increased to 19.9, a move up of 6 points. That came as new orders and shipments, the big drag in the current conditions survey, to “increase significantly,” while employment is “expected to grow considerably.”  
  
Capital spending expectations also rose sharply.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/retail-sales-report-july-2023.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/retail-sales-report-july-2023.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A Fitch Ratings analyst warned that the U.S. banking industry has inched closer to another source of turbulence — the risk of sweeping rating downgrades on dozens of U.S. banks that could even include the likes of JPMorgan Chase. The ratings agency cut its assessment of the industry’s health in June, a move that analyst Chris Wolfe said went largely unnoticed because it didn’t trigger downgrades on banks. But another one-notch downgrade of the industry’s score, to A+ from AA-, would force Fitch to reevaluate ratings on each of the more than 70 U.S. banks it covers, Wolfe told CNBC in an exclusive interview at the firm’s New York headquarters. “If we were to move it to A+, then that would recalibrate all our financial measures and would probably translate into negative rating actions,” Wolfe said.

The credit rating firms relied upon by bond investors have roiled markets lately with their actions. Last week, Moody’s downgraded 10 small and midsized banks and warned that cuts could come for another 17 lenders, including larger institutions like Truist and U.S. Bank. Earlier this month, Fitch downgraded the U.S. long-term credit rating because of political dysfunction and growing debt loads, a move that was derided by business leaders including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. This time, Fitch is intent on signaling to the market that bank downgrades, while not a foregone conclusion, are a real risk, said Wolfe. The firm’s June action took the industry’s “operating environment” score to AA- from AA because of pressure on the country’s credit rating, regulatory gaps exposed by the March regional bank failures and uncertainty around interest rates.

The problem created by another downgrade to A+ is that the industry’s score would then be lower than some of its top-rated lenders. The country’s two largest banks by assets, JPMorgan and Bank of America, would likely be cut to A+ from AA- in this scenario, since banks can’t be rated higher than the environment in which they operate. And if top institutions like JPMorgan are cut, then Fitch would be forced to at least consider downgrades on all their peers’ ratings, according to Wolfe. That could potentially push some weaker lenders closer to non-investment-grade status.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/fitch-warns-it-may-be-forced-to-downgrade-dozens-of-banks.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/fitch-warns-it-may-be-forced-to-downgrade-dozens-of-banks.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical analysis (TA)&lt;/strong&gt; uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;priced in&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security&amp;#39;s price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.&lt;/p&gt;

UAW president Shawn Fain raised some eyebrows during a Facebook Live video address in early August to the union faithful.

In an hour-long talk, Fain, a 20-year UAW veteran and a former shop chair at Stellantis' Kokomo, Indiana, plant, told members what he had planned for the Big Three automakers — GM (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLA), formerly Chrysler — for this year's contract negotiations. The bottom line was this: After all the sacrifices the UAW made over the years, the days of rolling over were done. The bill was due.

The stakes couldn't be higher for the UAW and the Big Three.

The current contract ends on September 14, at which point a work stoppage could occur if they don't strike a deal. The negotiations, if Fain's speech was any indication, will be the most contentious in recent memory. Why? Fain and current UAW leadership believe the union has given up too much in the past.

The increased rancor has already made a mark. Shares of GM, Ford, and Stellantis all dropped steeply last week, largely because Wall Street is concerned that a work stoppage would seriously impact automakers as they navigate a generational and costly electric transformation.

'These demands aren’t going to happen'

**The demands set out by Fain and UAW leadership include ""substantial wage increases,"" which amount to a 46% rise over three years; eliminating compensation tiers for new and old workers (which the UPS Teamsters secured); restoring cost of living adjustments; providing a new pension plan; and reducing work weeks to 32 hours from the standard 40.**

Making such demands in public ahead of contract talks isn't typical for the UAW and the Big Three automakers.

In the past, the UAW and Big Three went behind closed doors to negotiate after a contract was hammered out. The UAW then presented the proposed contract to its members for a vote.

Publicly releasing contract demands could backfire for the union, putting pressure on the leadership to avoid compromise and therefore up the likelihood of an impasse with the Big Three negotiators.

**But the tough-guy talk may be a plus: Fain, in essence, may be preparing the rank and file for a long, rough fight — a fight brought on by the costs facing the Big Three given these demands. According to Bloomberg, the cost of the UAW demands could amount to $80 billion over the course of the contract, which typically lasts three to four years.**

Fain's demands caught the automakers' leadership off guard.

""Everyone understands these demands aren’t going to happen — it would be suicidal for the companies to agree to this,"" one industry source told Yahoo Finance.

The UAW's wish list would amount to $25 billion-$30 billion per automaker over the life of the contract.

**""That adds $35 to $40 per hour to active labor cost — an increase of roughly 60%,"" the source said. The impact being that automakers would return to the ""bankruptcy era"" and more than double the labor costs for GM, Ford, and Stellantis versus non-union automakers like Tesla (TSLA).**

When reached for comment, a UAW spokesperson noted the industry source's take misrepresented a few key points.

""The Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor estimates that labor is just 5.1% of the cost of the average vehicle. That's a very important data point to take into account when the automakers claim that our demands will be catastrophic,"" UAW spokesperson Jim McNeil said.

McNeil also noted that the rising MSRPs of Big Three vehicles have not been driven by labor. ""[A recent study] published by the BLS shows that dealer markups have been driving up the costs of new cars, NOT labor costs.""

Finally, McNeil pointed to a recent statement made by Fain talking about the costs borne by UAW workers over the past decade and a half.

""Overall, the starting pay for a Big Three worker today is almost $21,000 less than it was in 2007 when adjusted for inflation,"" the statement said. ""UAW members made enormous sacrifices to save the automakers during the Great Recession, but we’ve never been made whole.""

A 'good faith' process

For its part, Big Three leadership has been striking more of a conciliatory tone, at least publicly.

GM President Mark Reuss recently told Yahoo Finance that GM is negotiating a deal ""that works for everybody in good faith.”

Meanwhile, Ford Chairman Bill Ford has said that the UAW isn’t the ""enemy"" and that he wants to find common ground.

But Stellantis, which just this week saw Fain throw its contract proposal into the trash in another Facebook Live video, said the UAW needs to focus on ""reality.""

""[The UAW] demands could endanger our ability to make decisions in the future that provide job security for our employees,"" Stellantis North America COO Mark Stewart said in a statement to employees, according to Reuters. ""This is a losing proposition for all of us.""
Wall Street wary

Wall Street, it seems, is anticipating the worst.

Last week CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson double-downgraded GM to Strong Sell and slashed his price target to $28 from $40. Nelson wrote in a client note, ""the growing risk of a UAW strike, given reports that the company and union remain extremely far apart in labor negotiations ... [and] newly-elected UAW President Shawn Fain appears to be aggressive and eager to make his mark with the Detroit Three.""

Nelson also said that the last UAW strike in 2019, which lasted 40 days, impacted GM’s earnings by $1.89 a share.

Morningstar automotive analyst David Whiston echoed those concerns, particularly for GM and Ford, which are more tied to the UAW compared to Stellantis, which has a bigger international labor presence.

""GM and Ford may be in the penalty box for a while. Wall Street hates uncertainty,"" Whiston said. ""This is not a normal negotiation, both in style and the demands they are asking.""

""This is a different time,"" longtime Detroit Free Press automotive writer Eric Lawrence told Yahoo Finance.

**""The union is talking in terms that they probably haven't talked in a long time. They've kind of come out swinging. They've kind of put the automakers on notice, and they've told the workers that they expect to fight for a lot of this contract.""**

Japan’s economy posted its third straight quarterly expansion, provisional government data showed Tuesday, as robust export growth contributed to an annualized 6% expansion in the second quarter, handily beating market expectations.

Economist surveyed by Reuters had expected the world’s third-largest economy to post 3.1% growth in the April-June quarter. The impressive gross domestic product data translated to a more modest quarterly expansion of 1.5%, topping expectations for 0.8% growth.

The benchmark Nikkei 225 index extended gains slightly to trade up nearly 1%, while the Japanese yen pared losses against the U.S. dollar and Japanese government bonds across the various tenures were broadly unchanged.

Tuesday’s GDP print pointed to a continued post-Covid recovery for Japan’s economy. Still, this narrower gap between reality and expectation in quarterly growth tempers any longer-term optimism.

“Japan’s economy expanded at an extremely rapid pace last quarter, but we expect a renewed slowdown across the second half of the year,” Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.

“However, the details of the report weren’t as impressive as the headline,” he added. “Instead, nearly all of the increase in output was driven by a 1.8%-pts boost from net trade. That marked the second-largest contribution from net trade in the 28-year history of the current GDP series, with only the bounce back in exports from the first lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic providing a larger boost.”

Exports rebounded 3.2% from the previous quarter — largely driven by the spike in car shipments — while imports plunged 4.3% over the time period.

Other details beyond the rosy headline GDP growth figure suggest the Bank of Japan is likely to revert from its ultra-easy monetary posture.

A surprise 0.5% annualized drop in private consumption expenditure, along with muted capital expenditure pointing to muted domestic demand despite the first employee compensation sequential increase in seven quarters.

This comes as inflation has exceeded the BOJ’s 2% target for 15 consecutive months.

195,stocks,"The previously unknown partner in a $2 billion video game mega-deal that mysteriously and dramatically collapsed last spring was the Saudi government-funded Savvy Games Group, Axios has learned.

Why it matters: The fallout of the failed deal sent shares of The Embracer Group — Savvy's would-be partner, and one of the most voracious acquirers of video games studios in the last several years — plummeting, and forced it into cost-cutting mode.

More broadly, the revelation may raise questions about how Saudi Arabia will proceed with its controversial ambitions to invest $38 billion in the video game industry.

Driving the news: Axios learned of Savvy's involvement from four sources familiar with the deal who were not authorized to speak about it publicly, and after reviewing documentation related to the planned partnership.

An Embracer spokesperson declined to comment for this story. A Savvy rep did not reply by press time.

Catch up quick: The $2 billion deal would have involved Savvy investing in the development and publishing of games from Embracer, helping establish the Saudi company as a major gaming label.

Embracer had been promising investors news of a lucrative ""transformative partnership … with several industry partners"" since November 2022.

But in a May 24, 2023 note, Embracer management announced the collapse of one of those massive partnerships, while carefully avoiding naming the partner.

In the May note, Embracer said that the parties had reached a verbal commitment in October 2022 that would have resulted in more than $2 billion ""in contracted development revenue over a period of six years.""

""All documentation was finalized and ready to go as of yesterday,"" the company said. ""We asked for the execution of the agreement before our Q4 announcement. However late last night we received a negative outcome from the counterparty.""

While Axios' sources were clear about who the deal was with, they were less certain about why Savvy walked away.

Embracer and Savvy are both rising forces in the games industry, and have worked together before.

Embracer has risen to prominence in recent years through a string of acquisitions, including its May 2022 $300 million purchase of several elite studios, along with the rights to the iconic Tomb Raider gaming franchise. In August 2022, it announced a $365 million purchase for the rights to Lord of the Rings.

Savvy emerged in January 2022 with the news that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, or Public Investment Fund (PIF), was setting it up as an attempt to invest in gaming and diversify the Kingdom's economy. It immediately announced the $1.5 billion purchase of two esports firms.

The intrigue: Over the last two years, the PIF has become one of the largest shareholders in several major gaming companies, including Nintendo, Take Two Interactive and Electronic Arts.

Savvy committed to investing $38 billion in the gaming industry, and in April 2023 said it would purchase mobile gaming company Scopely for $4.9 billion.

Embracer and Savvy announced a stock deal last June, with the Saudi firm purchasing $1 billion worth of Embracer shares — a move Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors swiftly defended amid criticism that the investment would compromise his company's values.

While Savvy executives have told Axios and others that their operation, which has a board chaired by Saudi crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman, is a genuine effort to get into gaming and address the professional and leisure interests of the kingdom's youthful population, it's nonetheless been accused of being a distraction from the country's human rights record, similar to criticism of so-called ""sportswashing"" that's emerged from Saudi-backed efforts in boxing and golf.

What's next: Embracer will announce its latest quarterly earnings Thursday, when it may begin to detail cost reductions which it has promised to have in place by October 1.

Meanwhile, some Embracer divisions continue to announce new games. And Embracer still has a lucrative deal with Amazon, which committed in December to publish the next Tomb Raider game as it, too, attempts to establish itself as a player in big-budget gaming.

But some Embracer studio projects are getting canceled — and one studio, Campfire Cabal, announced last week that it was being shut down due to Embracer's restructuring.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe Walmart will take a nice sized dip this week after earnings, for the following reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

First and foremast, I'd like to compare Walmart to their direct competitor Target. Walmart is valued at 431.35B while Targets market cap is 59B (Walmart 7x Target).

&amp;#x200B;

Walmart trades at significantly higher PE ratio of 38.85 while Target is 22.29.

&amp;#x200B;

Walmart is up a whopping 22% this year, while Target has fallen 25%

&amp;#x200B;

One of the primary reasons for purchasing Walmart stock according to investors, is that it is a ""recession proof business""

&amp;#x200B;

I disagree with that point based on the fact that they already operate on absolutely razer-thin margins currently, and those will only decrease in a recessionary environment. Furthermore, shoplifting has been rapidly increasing YoY. Over 3 Billion dollars worth of products are stolen from Walmart every year. I can't imagine this will DECREASE in a recession, only INCREASE.

&amp;#x200B;

The smallest increases in shoplifting further decrease Walmarts already razer thin margin.

&amp;#x200B;

Comparing Walmart to Target may be a mute point as they are different businesses for sure. But I think this comparison shows the weakness of Walmart's hyper-thin margin business model and shows their overvaluation.

&amp;#x200B;

Second point: Ecommerce.

&amp;#x200B;

Walmarts Ecommerce division loses a significant amount of money. You will have likely notice this if you have ordered from their platform before. They will deliver same-day oftentimes, on already razer thin margin grocery items. This is a disaster for any profits. They have been trying to gain traction via 3rd party sellers on the platform, but this has not caught on at all and is mostly Chinese sellers with very high ship times.

&amp;#x200B;

Third point: Insider Selling

&amp;#x200B;

Insiders have been offloading incredible amounts of shares recently, with no purchases since March 15. They offloaded 3+ billion in shares the first half of 2023 and continued selling massive amounts of shares throughout the summer of 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

While these shares have been offloaded, the stock price has continued to rise, raising the fund &amp; retail % ownership of the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

Walmart has earnings on Thursday (8/17) and Target has earnings on Wednesday (8/16). I believe both of these earnings calls will impact Walmart share price negatively, and Target positively.

&amp;#x200B;

Weather you buy Target stock or short Walmart is up to you. But I believe this week we see a nice sized correction, shortening the gap between the two companies market cap.

Tesla is implementing significant price reductions for its vehicles in China, following a substantial 31% drop in sales for July from the previous month. To counter the downturn in the world's largest automotive market, Tesla has trimmed the starting prices of its China-made Model Y long-range and performance models by 14,000 yuan (around $1,900), a reduction of 4.5% and 3.8% respectively. Additionally, the automaker will offer insurance subsidies of 8,000 yuan for entry-level, real-wheel-drive versions of Model 3 cars, available between Aug. 14 and Sept. 30.  
  
The move comes amidst a broader global decrease in demand for electric vehicles, and local competitors such as BYD regaining market share with more favorable pricing. Sales of Tesla’s China-made cars have been on a decline since the end of 2022, although the automaker did see a 31% year-over-year increase in sales in China in February 2023.  
  
Despite the decline in China, Tesla's global vehicle deliveries in Q2 2023 hit a record high of 466,100 units, a quarter-over-quarter increase of about 10.23%.

&lt;p&gt;Despite the decline in China, Tesla&amp;#39;s global vehicle deliveries in Q2 2023 hit a record high of 466,100 units, a quarter-over-quarter increase of about 10.23%. The announcement of the price cuts led to Tesla&amp;#39;s stock falling over 3% in premarket trading, reflecting investors&amp;#39; concerns over the sales slowdown in a key market for the electric vehicle maker.&lt;/p&gt;

207,stocks,"Pfizer stock has been severely damaged as investors sought alpha in AI plays, and the company's revenue hangover from the COVID vaccine is adversely hurting growth metrics.  Additionally, investors have been gravitating towards businesses that have a substantial exposure to weight-loss medications, such Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which have outperformed their sector peers. Given the generally bearish expert projections, the market is most likely set up for a weak Q2 announcement from Pfizer.  
With the exception of AbbVie (ABBV), the dividend yield is currently 4.3%, which is higher than that of any other pharmaceutical company. Additionally, AbbVie's share price is under pressure due to the loss of patent protection for Humira, a &gt;$20 billion selling medicine. Would you think that a 4.3% annual return on an investment with minimal downside risk—Pfizer's stock price rarely changes—would be a good return? It may not be the best company to have in a balanced portfolio, but interest rates are rising, so that may not be the case.  
Eliquis, which generated $6.5 billion in revenue for Pfizer in 2022, will lose its patent protection sometime around 2026. The Vyndaqel family of drugs, which treat hereditary forms of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (""ATTR-CM"") and generated $2.5 billion in revenue last year, and $1.8 billion from the sale of Xeljanz, are also expected to lose their patent exclusivity sometime around 2025.  
By 2027, generic versions of the oncology medications Xtandi, Ibrance, and Inlyta, which together generated close to $7.5 billion in revenue in 2022, may pose a danger. In fairness to Pfizer, its M&amp;A spending should help its ex-COVID product portfolio generate revenue growth over the coming years, despite the patents of several important drugs expiring. For context, AbbVie does not expect a single asset to go off patent between now and the end of the decade.  
Aside from the outrageous COVID profits, Pfizer is essentially the workhorse of the pharmaceutical industry, diligently advancing its mediocre (from a financial standpoint) but valuable (from a medical standpoint) pipeline and products while companies like Lilly advertise a self-injecting drug that causes you to lose weight and lose appetite. That may seem a bit cavalier towards Lilly, and it is unlikely that Pfizer intended for its stock price to remain so stable, but at the end of the day, 5.7 billion shares with virtually no room for growth and a dividend paying &gt;4% feel equally right.

But, if I added cash trading account accidentally on Rehypothecation form when setting up margin trading account, then shares from cash trading account will now become available to shorts to borrow,  in addition to shares in my margin trading account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a correct analysis? Im just wondering how many people have accidentally allowed their shares in the hands of shorts without knowing or wanting to do so! What&amp;#39;s your take on this?&lt;/p&gt;

218,stocks,"This week, I have an educational post, instead of a valuation one. It is all about impairment - a fancy term that I'm sure plenty of you have come across.  
The post is divided into 4 segments:

  
\- Impairment of tangible assets

\- Events that lead to impairment

\- Impairment of intangible assets

\- Impairment of goodwill

&amp;#x200B;

**Impairment of tangible assets**

Impairment, in the realm of accounting, refers to the **reduction of the value of an asset**.

Therefore, the first thing that we need to establish is, how is the value of an asset being measured, and why is this so important?

Let's start with a simple example. Imagine that there’s a company named XYZ, that owns a car, but there’s no employee with a driver’s license. Well, what can they do with the car? Nothing, but to sell it. So its value is equal to whatever the company can sell the car for, minus the costs that will be incurred in the process of selling. Let’s assume that this number was $20k. In accounting, this is the so-called ""**fair value less selling costs**"".

If the book value is $25k, that obviously doesn’t represent the fair value, and the car accounting-wise is overstated. Therefore, a $5k impairment would be recorded.

Now, let's imagine that there is someone who can drive it. In this case, the company can also derive value by using this asset. Therefore, the asset has so-called “**value in use**”. How can this asset be used? Plenty of ways. Let’s keep it simple, and assume that XYZ is a delivery business, and thanks to this asset, the company makes $2k net profit per month. The value of a business is the present value of future cash flows. Let’s assume that the value in use of the asset is $40k.

So, now, we have two numbers:

* Fair value less selling costs ($20k)
* Value in use ($40k)

On the balance sheet, the car is reported at $25k. So, is there an impairment? Which value should be used from the two above? The answer is - the higher one. That is the value of the asset to the business and that is referred to as ""**recoverable value**"". The company can ""recover"" $40k of value from the asset.

As the recoverable value of $40k is above the book value of $25k --&gt; There will be no impairment.

This so-called impairment test is mandatory and is done at least once a year.

  
**Events that lead to impairment**

There are plenty of events that could lead to impairment and they can be grouped into 3 categories:

1. **Change in demand** \- Remember the first example above, where the only option the company had was to sell the car? Well, if there is an adverse change in demand, that would lead to a lower price. So if the company is to sell the same asset, the cash received would be lower, leading to further impairment.
2. **Damage to the asset** \- Imagine if a tree falls over the car and it is now completely destroyed. It can no longer be sold for as much, and it can no longer be used. (Assuming there's no insurance on the car)
3. **Change in legal/economic condition** \- In the second example above, the business was generating $2k net profit per month. If the economic environment changes, and now the business is no longer as profitable, the value in use of $40k cannot be justified.

Although these are simple examples, if you understand this, you can follow the impairment of all physical assets.

Why would a company impair a building? Well, maybe the building is no longer in use, and the market prices declined significantly. Maybe there was a fire that damaged the building.

Why would a company impair inventory? The market prices could decline, it might be due to a flood that damaged the inventory, or it could be that the inventory became obsolete.

&amp;#x200B;

**Intangible assets**

Let’s introduce another company, named ABC, which owns a patent for cutting-edge technology. The company bought the patent from a start-up for $1 million. Based on the internal calculation, this patent will yield significant returns in the future and the price paid can be justified. So, on the balance sheet, there’s a patent reported with a book value of $1 million.

Recently, a few competitors developed similar technology, and the value of $1 million can no longer be justified. The estimated value in use has decreased and it is clear that an impairment would be recorded.

  
**Impairment of goodwill**

Now, let's bring the two companies together. The management of ABC decided that this whole patent cutting-edge technology is just not for them. Instead, they'll buy XYZ, the delivery business that owns a car. After running some calculations internally, they submitted an offer of $50k that was accepted.

So, they’re paying $50k for buying a car? Can they not buy a car and start their own business? Definitely, but it will take time until they get to the point of earning $2k/month. So paying more than the net assets value of a business is normal. They are also acquiring the customer relationships that XYZ built with its existing customers, the brand that was built over the years. These are intangible assets and some of them can be estimated.

So, on the balance sheet of ABC, there's $50k less cash, and instead, they got:

\- Car - $20k (the price if they are to buy the car on the open market)

\- Customer relationships - $10k

\- Goodwill - $20k

Goodwill is an accounting plug, that explains the entire cash outflow for an acquisition and it only occurs in this event. This is also subject to impairment.

When does it get impaired? When the value of the acquired business has declined and what is on the balance sheet can no longer be justified.

As mentioned earlier, the value of the business is the present value of the future cash flows. If the delivery business starts losing money and is expected to do so in the future, it is difficult to justify the $50k on the balance sheet. So, goodwill will get impaired. Impairment of goodwill is basically a result of a poor acquisition.

The management had certain assumptions, under which the value of the acquired company was estimated, and turns out they were wrong.

Before 2018, those who wanted to gamble on sports legally had to travel to casinos in Nevada, or three other states which were exempt from the ban.

But since the court decision, sports betting has been transformed into a high-growth tech business with over $12bn in revenue in 2022 and advertising that is fast becoming ubiquitous in American cultural life. Just this week, Disney-owned sports channel ESPN announced plans to launch a sports book, joining the likes of DraftKings, MGM, and Ireland-based Flutter Entertainment.

Punters can now legally bet on sporting events in 34 states as well as Washington DC. In 25 jurisdictions, they can do so online. Cumulatively, Americans have wagered $245bn on sports since 2018.

I made some regrettable decisions after the last FL earnings in May and purchased significantly more FL stock than I should, have which ive now averaged down to $27.63 per share. Currently am down 8.22% on the stock as the FL price as of market closing Friday is $25.36. At this point I am happy just to break even, or even sell at a minor loss (say 3% loss). What my question is that has been leaving me with much contemplation lately is, should I sell before earnings or wait for earnings and hope for the best? I know that no one can predict the future, I am just wondering if anyone can weigh in on insights regarding the likely outcome of FL earnings later this month. I know they have been struggling lately it seems as they closed a bunch of stores among other issues, so leaves me wondering if I should sell before earnings if I get close enough to breaking even for my satisfaction or if there's a likelihood the stock will pump following the earnings annoucement.

I am looking forward to putting this stock behind me as since buying it I have learned risk management techniques and vowed to not make the same mistakes of large volume purchases at one time again so no need to rip on me for buying this fuckup company (lol).

224,stocks,"Hi everyone.

I am living in Denmark where the BYD Dolphin has just been introduced. I was amazed by the price which in Denmark is WAY lower than ID.3, Model 3, and other competitors. Even though the bells and whistles might be missing, the warranty and the things most important to most - how far can it drive on a charge, etc, - is looking very good. 

So I think BYD is going to overtake Tesla and the others at least in the very small market in Denmark. Which leads me to think it might also be the case in other European countries. And BYD is as far as I can read and research one of the largest Chinese automobile sellers and one of the biggest battery manufactures in the world. So they have a lot going for it.

BUT, the stock is OTC (not on one of the usual exhanges) and it seems it did a largest price jump some 4 years back where the value quadrupled. 

SO, I am wondering if there's a catch? Is the value fair? Should I be worried over OTC?

225,stocks,"Both the supply and demand dynamics in the copper market are looking incredibly favorable.

From a 2022 Goldman Sachs report, ""Copper is so integral to the green transition – a global effort underpinned by government support – that the supply requirements necessitate a spike in copper prices""

**Demand will increase**

* EVs, EV charging, electrical transmission, and renewables all use a lot of copper, and are set to grow for the foreseeable future. 
   * For example, an EV uses at least 2x more copper than a gas powered car.
* There also isn't a clear replacement for copper in these products, meaning the price can continue to rise without destroying demand.
   * Aluminum is the most likely potential replacement, but not nearly as efficient (it would require a much higher volume of aluminum to do the same job).

**Supply will not keep up**

* Supply is expected to fall well short of demand in the 2nd half of this decade. 
* Ore grades are declining at many of the largest copper mines and there have been almost no major new discoveries in recent years.
* New copper mines can take 10 years to get up to full production, so they would not contribute to the supply equation until 2033.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** the world is going to need a lot of copper, there is no viable substitute, and the supply wont be there.

**Disclosure:** I am long COPX, FCX, IVPAF and IE, though these do not constitute a large % of my portfolio yet.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts? Am I missing anything? The most likely threat to the thesis above as far as I can see would be a breakthrough in extraction technology that dramatically increases supply.

# **Nasdaq Composite slips Friday, falls two weeks straight for the first time in 2023: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/10/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite ended Friday lower and notched its second consecutive losing week in 2023 as semiconductor stocks languished.
*****
&gt; The tech-heavy Nasdaq slid about 0.6% to end at 13,644.85, pulled down by a selloff in semiconductor stocks such as Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia and Micron. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) ended the week down 5.2%, its worst week since October 2022.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 inched lower by 0.1%, ending at 4,464.05. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 105.25 points, or 0.3%, closing at 35,281.40. The 30-stock index was helped by advances of 2.1% and 1.8% in Chevron and Merck &amp; Co., respectively.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq declined about 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively, on the week. Both registered their second straight losing week — a first of that length for the technology-heavy Nasdaq since the conclusion of a four-week losing streak in December 2022.
*****
&gt; The Dow is an outlier of the three major averages, advancing 0.6% this week.
*****
&gt; Investors had much to celebrate earlier in the week.
*****
&gt; July’s consumer price index, a major inflation reading for markets and the Federal Reserve, came in softer than anticipated on a year-over-year basis. Prices climbed 3.2% on an annual basis, less than the Dow Jones consensus estimate of 3.3%.
*****
&gt; To be sure, the CPI reading showed some signs of stickiness. So-called core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 4.7% from the prior year.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Disney rallied on the back of its earnings report released Wednesday. Despite a pullback in Friday’s session, shares were 3.2% higher on the week. That marks the biggest weekly gain for the entertainment giant since March.
*****
&gt; But inflation data released Friday complicated the picture. July’s producer price index, which tracks the price wholesalers pay for raw goods, rose 0.3% from the previous month. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a 0.2% increase month over month.
*****
&gt; This week’s moves are the latest in what’s been a rocky patch for the stock market after a strong performance in the first half of the year. The three major indexes are all lower than where they began August.
*****
&gt; “Investors continue to try to hang their hat on more consistency” within economic data, said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments. “What we’re seeing with these mixed results certainly increases the likelihood of more volatility ahead.”

&gt; Despite modest gains yesterday by DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, all the major indexes we track were down over the first eight trading days of August. As of yesterday’s close, August 10, NASDAQ was the weakest, off 4.24% this month. Russell 2000 was the second weakest, down 4.02%. S&amp;P 500 slipped 2.62% while DJIA was down 1.08%. Compared to past pre-election year August performance since 1950, this August has tracked closely. Should the market continue to track the historical pre-election year August pattern, a mid-month bounce could begin soon. This historical mid-month move is shaded in yellow in the following chart.

&gt; # Why $1 Trillion in Credit Card Debt Isn’t a Bad Thing

&gt; “It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.” -Henry David Thoreau

&gt; It finally happened, US consumers officially have more than $1 trillion in credit card debt, an all-time record. Not surprisingly, many claimed this was a sign the consumer was tapped out and simply spending and buying everything on credit cards. We don’t think it is that simple, in fact, we’d take the other side that this isn’t a major warning sign and the consumer is still quite healthy and not up to their eyeballs in debt.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-1-1-800x529.png))**

&gt; Every quarter the New York Fed releases their Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, and this is the report that just showed record credit card debt. Here’s a great chart that showed overall debt reached $17.06 trillion. Peeling back the onion showed that mortgage debt stood still at $12.01 trillion as of the end of June, making up a huge part of overall debt. Credit cards were up $45 billion to $1.03 trillion, meanwhile, car loans were at $1.58 trillion and student loans checked in at $1.57 billion.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-2-1-800x580.png))**

&gt; What stands out to me the most about the chart above is overall debt was virtually flat the past two quarters, from $17.05 to $17.06 trillion. Tells a much different picture than what the media makes it sound like with all the ‘soaring debt’, huh?

&gt; I really like the chart below from the NY Fed’s report that zooms in on the relative size of each part of debt. If you look at credit card debt specifically, it has consistently stayed in the same range over the long-term. So, credit card debt might be at a nominal record, but by no means are we seeing consumers go nuts buying everything on credit anymore than they ever have in history.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-3-1.png))**

&gt; Another way to think about this is wouldn’t people likely have more credit card debt if they were worth more? I call this ‘denominator blindness’. All we hear about is the numerator at a new high, but in a lot of cases, the denominator has been soaring as well. Go read the quote at the top from Thoreau again. I love that one, as there are different ways to look at things and to me, seeing the denominator is very important.

&gt; Here’s a good way to show this, overall net worth has increased significantly over time, from $44 trillion in 2000 to close to $150 trillion today. Maybe more credit debt shouldn’t be a surprise?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-4-1.png))**

&gt; Taking that same denominator blindness approach and looking at the percentage change of credit card debts and net wealth showed a much better backdrop. Since 2000, credit card debt has gained 106%, but net worth was up close to 250%. I will say it again, maybe more credit debt shouldn’t be such a surprise?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-5-800x545.png))**

&gt; Yes, rates are higher and there’s a lot of debt, so one logical question is: can consumers pay for all this debt? Here’s a great chart showing household debt service payments as a percentage of disposable income was down to 9.6% in the first quarter, well below the pre-pandemic average of 11.2%. In simple English, there might be a lot of debt, but people are making more money so it isn’t such a stretch to service all the debt. The second quarter data isn’t out yet, but given disposable income has increased and debt likely stayed flat, this will probably fall again soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-6.png))**

&gt; Here’s yet another way to show things aren’t as bad out there as it sounds. Credit card debt as a percentage of disposable income is 21%, still below the 22% from the end of 2019 and well beneath the 2003-2019 average of 26%. In other words, people have been making more than they have been adding to their credit cards the past few years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-7.png))**

&gt; But aren’t people just maxing out their credit cards? No they aren’t is the quick and simple answer. Here’s a chart that looks at credit utilization to show what we mean. Credit utilization is how much of your credit limit you are using. Sure enough, this has held steady at 22%, compared with the pre-pandemic level of 24%. Even home equity credit utilization is running at 38%, well beneath the historical average of 51%. Again, this might shock most people who saw on the nightly news how ‘high overall debt’ has been lately. It simply isn’t true.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-8.png))**

&gt; That’s enough about denominator blindness. Another thing we keep hearing is how consumers are in bad shape and the glass house is about to crack. Yet again, this just isn’t true, as delinquency balances didn’t increase last quarter, with 97.4% of total balances current on payments, unchanged from last quarter and higher than it was at the end of 2019. The chart below shows that delinquent balances that are more than 120 days late (including severely derogatory) are just 1.3% of total balances, below the 2.8% level before the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-9.png))**

&gt; There has been a jump in serious delinquencies on credit cards, but this is also simply getting back to more normal levels. The good news is other areas haven’t jumped higher yet.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-10.png))**

&gt; Here’s one that might shock most people, third-party collections hit an all-time low. If the consumer was in such bad shape like they keep telling us, this would probably show a much different backdrop. In fact, only 4.6% of consumers have collections against them, the lowest in history and well beneath the 6.3% from a year ago and 9.2% average through 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-11.png))**

&gt; Another way of showing consumers are in better shape than they keep telling us is business applications are soaring. In other words, entrepreneurship is soaring, not something you tend to see when people are worried about paying that next bill. Nearly 300,000 applications were filed the first half of this year, 2% more than last year and 21% above 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-12.png))**

&gt; I will end this blog (which turned out to be much longer than I expected) with some help from three of my friends.

&gt; First up, Callie Cox at eToro noted that credit card debt as a percent of total bank deposits was still historically low.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-13.png))**

&gt; Neil Dutta at RenMac noted that household balance sheets are in fine shape, as household debt to income fell to nearly 86% in Q2, the lowest level since Q4 2021. Neil surmises that it is incomes, not debt, that are the main drivers of consumption lately.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-14.png))**

&gt; Lastly, economists at Wells Fargo in a recent note said one major positive down the road is home equity. Consumers are sitting on trillions in equity and this could help in a lot of ways over the coming years. Read their great report for more on this concept.

&gt; We are aware the headlines regarding record credit card debt, student loan forgiveness and now some talk of credit card forgiveness are causing much anxiety for investors. Our take is we doubt there will be any forgiveness plans, especially in an election year. Instead, these headlines are being used in the media to create more division, eyeballs and clicks.

&gt; The bottom line to us is the consumer remains in much better shape than the average investor realizes.

&gt; # Disinflation is Happening, And There’s More to Come

&gt; Inflation has been top of mind for investors over the past year and a half, both from the perspective of what that means for the economy as well as monetary policy. So, the latest release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks a basket of goods and services purchased by households, looms large every month. The big question going into this report was: inflation has pulled back, but will it stay lower and continue to pull back further?

&gt; Based on the July report, the answer is yes.
Headline CPI rose 0.2% in July, as was expected. Inflation was up 3.2% year-over-year, a tick below expectations for a 3.3% reading. That’s well below the June 2022 level of 9%. As you can see in the chart below, energy, food, and vehicle prices have driven inflation lower. 

&gt; Over the past year:
&gt; * Energy prices are down 12%
&gt; * Food price inflation has eased to 4.9% (it was 11% in July 2022)
&gt; * Used car prices are down 6%

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-headline-CPI-662x800.png))**

&gt; Looking at year-over-year numbers can be a little misleading, especially because they’re dependent on the data from a year ago and that’s not particularly helpful to understand what’s happening right now. At the same time, monthly data can be noisy. That is why I like to look at the 3-month average, and as of July, headline inflation is running at a 1.9% annual pace over the past 3 months.

&gt; We got good news on the core inflation front too, which is what the Federal Reserve focuses on since it removes volatile components like food and energy. Core inflation rose 0.2% in July, and over the last three months, it’s running at an annual pace of 3.1%. That’s a decisive shift lower from what we’ve seen over the past year and a half.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-headline-core-inflation-3M-changes-567x800.png))**

&gt; There are two big reasons why core inflation is pulling back, and it gets to why we believe inflation has more room to go lower. Vehicle and shelter make up 50% of the core inflation basket, and so what happens there is critical. Let’s talk about these.

&gt; As I noted above, used car prices are pulling back. In fact, private data indicates that used car prices have fallen 11% since March, but that’s yet to be fully reflected in official data. So, there’s further room to fall over the next couple of months. Also, new vehicle prices have fallen about 0.5% since March, and this could continue moving lower as auto production improves and inventories rise.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-used-car-prices-597x800.png))**

&gt; Shelter inflation has been decelerating for a while now. It was running at an 8-10% annual pace at the beginning of the year. That slowed to the 6-7% range between March and May, and over the last two months, it’s moved below 6%. That’s progress, albeit slow.

&gt; However, we know there’s a lot more room to go further down based on what’s happening in the rental market. Note that official shelter inflation does NOT include home prices and is just a measure of rents. Vacancies are up, and data from Apartment List shows that the national average rent is down 1% over the past year as of July.

&gt; Official shelter inflation may not get to that low a level, but safe to say, it’s heading a lot lower from where it is now. Shelter inflation averaged about 3-3.5% between 2018-2019, which was consistent with core inflation running at 2% (the Fed’s target). Based on what we know now, shelter could fall to an annual pace as low as 2.5%, and that would be a significant downward force on inflation.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-rnets-apartment-list-vs-official-598x800.png))**

&gt; Even beyond vehicles and shelter, there are positive signs.

&gt; A lot of supply-chain-impacted categories, like household furnishings and apparel, are also seeing disinflation. Airfares have been falling for four straight months now, with prices 20% lower from March. Even hotel/motel prices are down 4% over the same period. Of course, this is unlikely to continue, but it is more than welcome.

&gt; All in all, the big takeaway is that disinflation is happening, and we’re likely to see more of it going forward.

&gt; This also means the Federal Reserve is less likely to raise rates again at their September meeting. And if the inflation data progresses as we expect, the July rate hike may very well have been the last of the cycle. That’s going to be a big positive for investors as we head into the fall and winter.

&gt; # Bulls and Bears Beat the Average for Ten

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's selloff over the last week heading into today's CPI print caused bullish sentiment to dip a little. Compared to last week when 49% of respondents to the weekly AAII survey reported as bullish, this week only 44.7% reported as such. That is the weakest reading on optimism in a month, but remains well above the range of readings of most of the past year and a half.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The drop in bullishness was met with an increase in bearishness. Bearish sentiment rose back above 25% for the first time since the week of July 14th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; In turn, the bull-bear spread moved lower this week, crossing back below 20 to 19.2. That is the lowest reading in four weeks as the spread continues to point toward an overall bullish tilt to investor sentiment.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; In fact, this week marked the tenth in a row that bullish sentiment sat above its historical average while simultaneously bearish sentiment was below its historical average. Looking across the past twenty years, there are not many examples of this sort of extended bullish sentiment streaks. In fact, only three other periods saw streaks of similar length. The most recent ended in May 2021 at 13 weeks. Before that, there was an identically long streak in the first quarter of 2012 and prior to that, you'd have to go all the way back to 2004 to find an example. In the 1990s through late 2000, such streaks were much more common.

&gt; # Claims Seasonal Tailwinds Waver

&gt; Initial Jobless Claims have been back on the rise for the last two weeks with this week's reading coming in at 248k versus estimates for 230k. That is the most elevated reading since the first week of July and marks the largest week-over-week rise since the first week of June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; Before seasonal adjustment, claims totaled 225.6K, up roughly 20K from the previous week. At those levels, claims are above those of the comparable week of last year and multiple pre-pandemic years. The past couple of weeks have seen particularly pronounced seasonal tailwinds which have historically ebbed this week and will again likely happen next week. However, those tailwinds are set to continue later this month into September when claims have typically reached an annual low point.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Lagged one week to initial claims, continuing claims came in lower than expected, dropping to 1.684 million from 1.7 million. That is slightly above the low from two weeks ago but does not yet disrupt the trend downward in continuing claims.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-Claims-3.png))**

&gt; As for a state level breakdown of claims, in the heatmap below we show where continuing claims are most and least elevated as a share of the each state's respective labor force. As shown, the West Coast and Northeast are the two weakest regions of the country with the highest percentage of continuing claims. Some states in the Southwest like Texas and New Mexico and the Midwest like Illinois and Minnesota also have pockets of weakness. Given various states have different unemployment insurance program eligibility requirements, benefit amounts, and program lengths, that is not necessarily to say these are the areas with the highest unemployment rates, but rather these are the places contributing the most to national claims counts.

&gt; # Small Businesses Less Concerned With Inflation

&gt; In an earlier post, we noted the improvement to small business sentiment per the latest data from the NFIB. The report also includes survey responses as to what small businesses perceive to be their biggest problems. The July report showed that small businesses have begun to take notice of easing inflation. As shown below, throughout 2022 and into portions of 2023, inflation has ranked as the number one problem among small businesses. But in July, Quality of Labor retook the number one spot as it had temporarily back in May. Meanwhile, there has been a rise businesses saying that government requirements and red tape are their number one problem, tying cost of labor for the fourth most pressing issue.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-MIP-1b.png))**

&gt; Obviously, as it still occupies the number two spot, inflation remains a major problem. Even though it is a big improvement from 37% exactly one year ago, there continues to be 21% of firms that report inflation as their biggest problem. That is also well above any reading observed pre-pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-MIP-2.png))**

&gt; On a combined basis, cost and quality of labor are the most commonly reported problem for small businesses at 33% of responses. Unlike inflation which is hitting new lows, that is in the middle of the past few years' range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-MIP-5.png))**

&gt; Historically, the NFIB survey has had sensitivities to politics with a bias towards being more optimistic during Republican administrations and vice versa. Since the Biden Presidency began, government related problems have been on the backburner given that inflation has been playing a more pressing role. However, there has been a steadily rising number of responses once again reporting government red tape or taxes as their biggest issues. That has come hand in hand with an increase in the survey's Economic Policy Uncertainty Index which experienced a pronounced 4 point jump month over month in July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-MIP-3.png))**

&gt; Finally, we would note very few firms are reporting sales as their biggest problem. That is a significant disconnect from the index on actual sales changes which hit new lows in July.

&gt; # Small Business Sentiment Bounces Back

&gt; Small business sentiment from the NFIB's monthly survey rebounded in July with the headline index reading 91.9 versus expectations of it rising only 0.3 points to 91.3. As shown below, small businesses are still reporting much weaker optimism than pre-pandemic or even in the first year of the pandemic, but sentiment has been making steady improvements in recent months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-1.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we break down each category of the NFIB's survey. Again, the headline index remains historically low in the 14th percentile of readings. However, that is up from the 9th percentile last month. Most other categories that contribute to the optimism index also rose month over month, albeit there were multiple that went unchanged. As a result of those moves, most categories remain at the low end of their historical ranges with a couple of exceptions: Plans to Increase Employment and Job Openings Hard to Fill. Each of those readings are in the 76th and 94th percentiles, respectively. However, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, overall this survey's employment metrics have pointed to softening of labor market activity.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-1a.png))**

&gt; While several categories saw stronger readings in July, none rose more than Outlook for General Business conditions which jumped by 10 points month over month. That is the second 10 point increase in a row which makes for the largest two month increase since May 2020. Although that reading showed an increase in optimism which coincides with continued improvement in the number of firms reporting that inflation pressures have eased, readings on small businesses actual operations were less rosy. Even though sales expectations were up, actual sales changes hit a new low of -13, the weakest since the spring of 2020, resulting in earnings changes to also drop.

&gt; # Long End Historically Oversold

&gt; Treasury yields at the long end of the curve are once again rising today with the yield on the 30 year up 3.3 bps as of this writing. That is in the context of what has already been a dramatic move higher in yields of long term Treasuries. As we discussed in Friday's Bespoke report, the ETF tracking longer-dated Treasuries, the iShares 20+ Year US Treasury ETF (TLT), fell 1% or more three days in a row last week (prices fall when yields rise). Meanwhile, that move higher in long end yields has also been observed in other places of the world like Germany, as discussed in today's Morning Lineup.

&gt; Given the steep rise in yields and hence a drop in the price of TLT, the ETF is trading at extremely oversold levels. While it has come back slightly and is currently 2.66 standard deviations below its 50-day moving average, at the most oversold reading last Thursday, TLT traded 3.84 standard deviations below its 50-DMA. In its over 20 years of history, that is the most oversold reading on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080723-TLT-1.png))**

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080723-TLT-2.png))**

&gt; As shown above there have only been a handful of other periods in which TLT has fallen at least three standard deviations below its 50-DMA as it did last week. In most circumstances, when an asset reaches such extreme levels of oversold, the thinking is that some upside mean reversion can be expected. However, the exact opposite has played out for TLT historically. As shown below, across the prior seven instances in which TLT got 3+ standard deviations below its 50-DMA, the ETF was lower a year later four times.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and an awesome trading week ahead r/stocks. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Friday evening to all of you here on &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt;! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 14th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nasdaq Composite slips Friday, falls two weeks straight for the first time in 2023: Live updates - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/10/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq Composite ended Friday lower and notched its second consecutive losing week in 2023 as semiconductor stocks languished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tech-heavy Nasdaq slid about 0.6% to end at 13,644.85, pulled down by a selloff in semiconductor stocks such as Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia and Micron. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) ended the week down 5.2%, its worst week since October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 inched lower by 0.1%, ending at 4,464.05. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 105.25 points, or 0.3%, closing at 35,281.40. The 30-stock index was helped by advances of 2.1% and 1.8% in Chevron and Merck &amp;amp; Co., respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq declined about 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively, on the week. Both registered their second straight losing week — a first of that length for the technology-heavy Nasdaq since the conclusion of a four-week losing streak in December 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dow is an outlier of the three major averages, advancing 0.6% this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors had much to celebrate earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July’s consumer price index, a major inflation reading for markets and the Federal Reserve, came in softer than anticipated on a year-over-year basis. Prices climbed 3.2% on an annual basis, less than the Dow Jones consensus estimate of 3.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the CPI reading showed some signs of stickiness. So-called core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 4.7% from the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Disney rallied on the back of its earnings report released Wednesday. Despite a pullback in Friday’s session, shares were 3.2% higher on the week. That marks the biggest weekly gain for the entertainment giant since March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But inflation data released Friday complicated the picture. July’s producer price index, which tracks the price wholesalers pay for raw goods, rose 0.3% from the previous month. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a 0.2% increase month over month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s moves are the latest in what’s been a rocky patch for the stock market after a strong performance in the first half of the year. The three major indexes are all lower than where they began August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Investors continue to try to hang their hat on more consistency” within economic data, said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments. “What we’re seeing with these mixed results certainly increases the likelihood of more volatility ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite modest gains yesterday by DJIA, S&amp;amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, all the major indexes we track were down over the first eight trading days of August. As of yesterday’s close, August 10, NASDAQ was the weakest, off 4.24% this month. Russell 2000 was the second weakest, down 4.02%. S&amp;amp;P 500 slipped 2.62% while DJIA was down 1.08%. Compared to past pre-election year August performance since 1950, this August has tracked closely. Should the market continue to track the historical pre-election year August pattern, a mid-month bounce could begin soon. This historical mid-month move is shaded in yellow in the following chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Why $1 Trillion in Credit Card Debt Isn’t a Bad Thing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.” -Henry David Thoreau&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It finally happened, US consumers officially have more than $1 trillion in credit card debt, an all-time record. Not surprisingly, many claimed this was a sign the consumer was tapped out and simply spending and buying everything on credit cards. We don’t think it is that simple, in fact, we’d take the other side that this isn’t a major warning sign and the consumer is still quite healthy and not up to their eyeballs in debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every quarter the New York Fed releases their Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, and this is the report that just showed record credit card debt. Here’s a great chart that showed overall debt reached $17.06 trillion. Peeling back the onion showed that mortgage debt stood still at $12.01 trillion as of the end of June, making up a huge part of overall debt. Credit cards were up $45 billion to $1.03 trillion, meanwhile, car loans were at $1.58 trillion and student loans checked in at $1.57 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What stands out to me the most about the chart above is overall debt was virtually flat the past two quarters, from $17.05 to $17.06 trillion. Tells a much different picture than what the media makes it sound like with all the ‘soaring debt’, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the chart below from the NY Fed’s report that zooms in on the relative size of each part of debt. If you look at credit card debt specifically, it has consistently stayed in the same range over the long-term. So, credit card debt might be at a nominal record, but by no means are we seeing consumers go nuts buying everything on credit anymore than they ever have in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about this is wouldn’t people likely have more credit card debt if they were worth more? I call this ‘denominator blindness’. All we hear about is the numerator at a new high, but in a lot of cases, the denominator has been soaring as well. Go read the quote at the top from Thoreau again. I love that one, as there are different ways to look at things and to me, seeing the denominator is very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a good way to show this, overall net worth has increased significantly over time, from $44 trillion in 2000 to close to $150 trillion today. Maybe more credit debt shouldn’t be a surprise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-4-1.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking that same denominator blindness approach and looking at the percentage change of credit card debts and net wealth showed a much better backdrop. Since 2000, credit card debt has gained 106%, but net worth was up close to 250%. I will say it again, maybe more credit debt shouldn’t be such a surprise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, rates are higher and there’s a lot of debt, so one logical question is: can consumers pay for all this debt? Here’s a great chart showing household debt service payments as a percentage of disposable income was down to 9.6% in the first quarter, well below the pre-pandemic average of 11.2%. In simple English, there might be a lot of debt, but people are making more money so it isn’t such a stretch to service all the debt. The second quarter data isn’t out yet, but given disposable income has increased and debt likely stayed flat, this will probably fall again soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s yet another way to show things aren’t as bad out there as it sounds. Credit card debt as a percentage of disposable income is 21%, still below the 22% from the end of 2019 and well beneath the 2003-2019 average of 26%. In other words, people have been making more than they have been adding to their credit cards the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But aren’t people just maxing out their credit cards? No they aren’t is the quick and simple answer. Here’s a chart that looks at credit utilization to show what we mean. Credit utilization is how much of your credit limit you are using. Sure enough, this has held steady at 22%, compared with the pre-pandemic level of 24%. Even home equity credit utilization is running at 38%, well beneath the historical average of 51%. Again, this might shock most people who saw on the nightly news how ‘high overall debt’ has been lately. It simply isn’t true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s enough about denominator blindness. Another thing we keep hearing is how consumers are in bad shape and the glass house is about to crack. Yet again, this just isn’t true, as delinquency balances didn’t increase last quarter, with 97.4% of total balances current on payments, unchanged from last quarter and higher than it was at the end of 2019. The chart below shows that delinquent balances that are more than 120 days late (including severely derogatory) are just 1.3% of total balances, below the 2.8% level before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a jump in serious delinquencies on credit cards, but this is also simply getting back to more normal levels. The good news is other areas haven’t jumped higher yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s one that might shock most people, third-party collections hit an all-time low. If the consumer was in such bad shape like they keep telling us, this would probably show a much different backdrop. In fact, only 4.6% of consumers have collections against them, the lowest in history and well beneath the 6.3% from a year ago and 9.2% average through 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way of showing consumers are in better shape than they keep telling us is business applications are soaring. In other words, entrepreneurship is soaring, not something you tend to see when people are worried about paying that next bill. Nearly 300,000 applications were filed the first half of this year, 2% more than last year and 21% above 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will end this blog (which turned out to be much longer than I expected) with some help from three of my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, Callie Cox at eToro noted that credit card debt as a percent of total bank deposits was still historically low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-13.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neil Dutta at RenMac noted that household balance sheets are in fine shape, as household debt to income fell to nearly 86% in Q2, the lowest level since Q4 2021. Neil surmises that it is incomes, not debt, that are the main drivers of consumption lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, economists at Wells Fargo in a recent note said one major positive down the road is home equity. Consumers are sitting on trillions in equity and this could help in a lot of ways over the coming years. Read their great report for more on this concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are aware the headlines regarding record credit card debt, student loan forgiveness and now some talk of credit card forgiveness are causing much anxiety for investors. Our take is we doubt there will be any forgiveness plans, especially in an election year. Instead, these headlines are being used in the media to create more division, eyeballs and clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line to us is the consumer remains in much better shape than the average investor realizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Disinflation is Happening, And There’s More to Come&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation has been top of mind for investors over the past year and a half, both from the perspective of what that means for the economy as well as monetary policy. So, the latest release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks a basket of goods and services purchased by households, looms large every month. The big question going into this report was: inflation has pulled back, but will it stay lower and continue to pull back further?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the July report, the answer is yes.
Headline CPI rose 0.2% in July, as was expected. Inflation was up 3.2% year-over-year, a tick below expectations for a 3.3% reading. That’s well below the June 2022 level of 9%. As you can see in the chart below, energy, food, and vehicle prices have driven inflation lower. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year:
* Energy prices are down 12%
* Food price inflation has eased to 4.9% (it was 11% in July 2022)
* Used car prices are down 6%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-headline-CPI-662x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at year-over-year numbers can be a little misleading, especially because they’re dependent on the data from a year ago and that’s not particularly helpful to understand what’s happening right now. At the same time, monthly data can be noisy. That is why I like to look at the 3-month average, and as of July, headline inflation is running at a 1.9% annual pace over the past 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got good news on the core inflation front too, which is what the Federal Reserve focuses on since it removes volatile components like food and energy. Core inflation rose 0.2% in July, and over the last three months, it’s running at an annual pace of 3.1%. That’s a decisive shift lower from what we’ve seen over the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-headline-core-inflation-3M-changes-567x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two big reasons why core inflation is pulling back, and it gets to why we believe inflation has more room to go lower. Vehicle and shelter make up 50% of the core inflation basket, and so what happens there is critical. Let’s talk about these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I noted above, used car prices are pulling back. In fact, private data indicates that used car prices have fallen 11% since March, but that’s yet to be fully reflected in official data. So, there’s further room to fall over the next couple of months. Also, new vehicle prices have fallen about 0.5% since March, and this could continue moving lower as auto production improves and inventories rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-used-car-prices-597x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shelter inflation has been decelerating for a while now. It was running at an 8-10% annual pace at the beginning of the year. That slowed to the 6-7% range between March and May, and over the last two months, it’s moved below 6%. That’s progress, albeit slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we know there’s a lot more room to go further down based on what’s happening in the rental market. Note that official shelter inflation does NOT include home prices and is just a measure of rents. Vacancies are up, and data from Apartment List shows that the national average rent is down 1% over the past year as of July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official shelter inflation may not get to that low a level, but safe to say, it’s heading a lot lower from where it is now. Shelter inflation averaged about 3-3.5% between 2018-2019, which was consistent with core inflation running at 2% (the Fed’s target). Based on what we know now, shelter could fall to an annual pace as low as 2.5%, and that would be a significant downward force on inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-rnets-apartment-list-vs-official-598x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even beyond vehicles and shelter, there are positive signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of supply-chain-impacted categories, like household furnishings and apparel, are also seeing disinflation. Airfares have been falling for four straight months now, with prices 20% lower from March. Even hotel/motel prices are down 4% over the same period. Of course, this is unlikely to continue, but it is more than welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the big takeaway is that disinflation is happening, and we’re likely to see more of it going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also means the Federal Reserve is less likely to raise rates again at their September meeting. And if the inflation data progresses as we expect, the July rate hike may very well have been the last of the cycle. That’s going to be a big positive for investors as we head into the fall and winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bulls and Bears Beat the Average for Ten&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500&amp;#39;s selloff over the last week heading into today&amp;#39;s CPI print caused bullish sentiment to dip a little. Compared to last week when 49% of respondents to the weekly AAII survey reported as bullish, this week only 44.7% reported as such. That is the weakest reading on optimism in a month, but remains well above the range of readings of most of the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-AAII-1.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drop in bullishness was met with an increase in bearishness. Bearish sentiment rose back above 25% for the first time since the week of July 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-AAII-2.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In turn, the bull-bear spread moved lower this week, crossing back below 20 to 19.2. That is the lowest reading in four weeks as the spread continues to point toward an overall bullish tilt to investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this week marked the tenth in a row that bullish sentiment sat above its historical average while simultaneously bearish sentiment was below its historical average. Looking across the past twenty years, there are not many examples of this sort of extended bullish sentiment streaks. In fact, only three other periods saw streaks of similar length. The most recent ended in May 2021 at 13 weeks. Before that, there was an identically long streak in the first quarter of 2012 and prior to that, you&amp;#39;d have to go all the way back to 2004 to find an example. In the 1990s through late 2000, such streaks were much more common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Claims Seasonal Tailwinds Waver&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial Jobless Claims have been back on the rise for the last two weeks with this week&amp;#39;s reading coming in at 248k versus estimates for 230k. That is the most elevated reading since the first week of July and marks the largest week-over-week rise since the first week of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before seasonal adjustment, claims totaled 225.6K, up roughly 20K from the previous week. At those levels, claims are above those of the comparable week of last year and multiple pre-pandemic years. The past couple of weeks have seen particularly pronounced seasonal tailwinds which have historically ebbed this week and will again likely happen next week. However, those tailwinds are set to continue later this month into September when claims have typically reached an annual low point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lagged one week to initial claims, continuing claims came in lower than expected, dropping to 1.684 million from 1.7 million. That is slightly above the low from two weeks ago but does not yet disrupt the trend downward in continuing claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for a state level breakdown of claims, in the heatmap below we show where continuing claims are most and least elevated as a share of the each state&amp;#39;s respective labor force. As shown, the West Coast and Northeast are the two weakest regions of the country with the highest percentage of continuing claims. Some states in the Southwest like Texas and New Mexico and the Midwest like Illinois and Minnesota also have pockets of weakness. Given various states have different unemployment insurance program eligibility requirements, benefit amounts, and program lengths, that is not necessarily to say these are the areas with the highest unemployment rates, but rather these are the places contributing the most to national claims counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Small Businesses Less Concerned With Inflation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an earlier post, we noted the improvement to small business sentiment per the latest data from the NFIB. The report also includes survey responses as to what small businesses perceive to be their biggest problems. The July report showed that small businesses have begun to take notice of easing inflation. As shown below, throughout 2022 and into portions of 2023, inflation has ranked as the number one problem among small businesses. But in July, Quality of Labor retook the number one spot as it had temporarily back in May. Meanwhile, there has been a rise businesses saying that government requirements and red tape are their number one problem, tying cost of labor for the fourth most pressing issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-MIP-1b.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, as it still occupies the number two spot, inflation remains a major problem. Even though it is a big improvement from 37% exactly one year ago, there continues to be 21% of firms that report inflation as their biggest problem. That is also well above any reading observed pre-pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-MIP-2.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a combined basis, cost and quality of labor are the most commonly reported problem for small businesses at 33% of responses. Unlike inflation which is hitting new lows, that is in the middle of the past few years&amp;#39; range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the NFIB survey has had sensitivities to politics with a bias towards being more optimistic during Republican administrations and vice versa. Since the Biden Presidency began, government related problems have been on the backburner given that inflation has been playing a more pressing role. However, there has been a steadily rising number of responses once again reporting government red tape or taxes as their biggest issues. That has come hand in hand with an increase in the survey&amp;#39;s Economic Policy Uncertainty Index which experienced a pronounced 4 point jump month over month in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would note very few firms are reporting sales as their biggest problem. That is a significant disconnect from the index on actual sales changes which hit new lows in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Small Business Sentiment Bounces Back&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small business sentiment from the NFIB&amp;#39;s monthly survey rebounded in July with the headline index reading 91.9 versus expectations of it rising only 0.3 points to 91.3. As shown below, small businesses are still reporting much weaker optimism than pre-pandemic or even in the first year of the pandemic, but sentiment has been making steady improvements in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-1.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the table below, we break down each category of the NFIB&amp;#39;s survey. Again, the headline index remains historically low in the 14th percentile of readings. However, that is up from the 9th percentile last month. Most other categories that contribute to the optimism index also rose month over month, albeit there were multiple that went unchanged. As a result of those moves, most categories remain at the low end of their historical ranges with a couple of exceptions: Plans to Increase Employment and Job Openings Hard to Fill. Each of those readings are in the 76th and 94th percentiles, respectively. However, as we noted in today&amp;#39;s Morning Lineup, overall this survey&amp;#39;s employment metrics have pointed to softening of labor market activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-1a.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While several categories saw stronger readings in July, none rose more than Outlook for General Business conditions which jumped by 10 points month over month. That is the second 10 point increase in a row which makes for the largest two month increase since May 2020. Although that reading showed an increase in optimism which coincides with continued improvement in the number of firms reporting that inflation pressures have eased, readings on small businesses actual operations were less rosy. Even though sales expectations were up, actual sales changes hit a new low of -13, the weakest since the spring of 2020, resulting in earnings changes to also drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Long End Historically Oversold&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasury yields at the long end of the curve are once again rising today with the yield on the 30 year up 3.3 bps as of this writing. That is in the context of what has already been a dramatic move higher in yields of long term Treasuries. As we discussed in Friday&amp;#39;s Bespoke report, the ETF tracking longer-dated Treasuries, the iShares 20+ Year US Treasury ETF (TLT), fell 1% or more three days in a row last week (prices fall when yields rise). Meanwhile, that move higher in long end yields has also been observed in other places of the world like Germany, as discussed in today&amp;#39;s Morning Lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the steep rise in yields and hence a drop in the price of TLT, the ETF is trading at extremely oversold levels. While it has come back slightly and is currently 2.66 standard deviations below its 50-day moving average, at the most oversold reading last Thursday, TLT traded 3.84 standard deviations below its 50-DMA. In its over 20 years of history, that is the most oversold reading on record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown above there have only been a handful of other periods in which TLT has fallen at least three standard deviations below its 50-DMA as it did last week. In most circumstances, when an asset reaches such extreme levels of oversold, the thinking is that some upside mean reversion can be expected. However, the exact opposite has played out for TLT historically. As shown below, across the prior seven instances in which TLT got 3+ standard deviations below its 50-DMA, the ETF was lower a year later four times.&lt;/p&gt;

* Where are people getting the stats on what percentage of people beat the SP500? What study has access to everyone's accounts and trading history to make these claims? This is just repeated over and over.
* There is a lot of misinformation out there about investing, that you cannot do it yourself and you must pay someone else to do it for you.
* A fund is a basket of individual stocks, your portfolio is a basket of individual stocks.
* Look at the price chart of a stock before you even start researching it. Is the stock losing value every year or is the chart all over the place. Most likely it will keep doing that. Why waste your time with those when there are stocks where the value has been increasing for decades.
* In general individuals would do a lot better avoiding unprofitable companies. You in fact buying a stake in the ownership in a company when you buy the stock. If individuals thought more about ownership they would realize a profitable company makes more sense than an unprofitable one in terms of the future.
* Building your own portfolio does not mean you have to have high turnover in your stocks.
* If you have a losing stock, its weighting will decrease while the winning stocks weighting will increase. Thus a losing stock has a lesser and lesser impact over time.
* You are allowed to add and remove stocks from your portfolio just like the SP500 committee adds and removes stocks.
* You can build a portfolio that captures more upside than the SP500 and captures similar or less downside of the SP500. Basically you are sampling the SP500.
* The SP500 is actively managed by S&amp;P Global.
* Ignorance about stock market investing is very expensive.
* Past Performance Is Not Indicative Of Future Results, then how do people make projections on investing in the SP500 for long periods of time?
* People will say but you cannot beat the market for 30 years. Someone does not need to invest for 30 years, you can hit your financial goal much earlier and do something else afterwards.
* You do not have to beat the SP500 every year to do better than the SP500. You calculate the average of each year over at least a 5 year period then compare. I see people quit their plan because in the short term, the beginning, they may be underperforming.
* When people say that the failed at stock picking and to not do it, they don't list what the stocks were. A lot of the time if they ever reveal it, it is an unprofitable or struggling company with a price chart that has been descending for years.
* There are plenty of outperforming stocks within the SP500 but their weightings are so small, 0.1% in some cases, that they barely make a difference.
* If you can separate your feelings from investing you will do a lot better.
* If you know your statistics about the stock market you will do a lot better. Really just know the principles of basic statistics in general.
* People who say it is a waste of time researching companies and other investing relating activities because your time is best used elsewhere. Yet we go to school, some take out massive student loans, to learn for the purpose of getting a job to make money.

236,stocks,"The connection is straightforward: a dip in inflation is largely tied to plummeting energy and food prices.

In July 2023, the average WTI oil price dropped 23.49% as compared with July 2022. Meanwhile, natural gas prices plummeted by 63.31%, and corn by 17.27%. Observing these figures, particularly for natural gas, makes one question the rise in the CPI. The answer there lies in persistent core inflation.

Should commodity prices, especially oil, pivot from dampening overall price growth to driving it, we could anticipate multiple rate hikes from the Fed. In June, WTI's year-over-year decline stood at 38.54%, significantly greater than July's. This partly explains why July's CPI saw a 3.2% YoY growth following June's 3.0%. As we step into August, WTI is a mere 10.07% down from the previous year. If this trajectory holds, the CPI could surge by 4-5% by year-end.

Higher oil prices not only hint at steeper rates, but also increase the odds of an impending recession—a bleak prospect for stocks.

So, will oil prices maintain their ascent?

The IEA predicts an unprecedented global oil demand this year—at 102.2 million barrels daily, with an additional 1 million slated for 2024. Even if we discount the IEA's history of alarmist predictions, this forecast shouldn’t exactly come as a shock, especially when we recall that OPEC+ reliably curtails supply to bolster prices. In July alone, global supply shrank by 910,000 barrels daily due to Saudi Arabia's decision to pull an extra 1 million from the marketplace.

And yet the IEA also anticipates that in 2023, non-OPEC+ supply will climb by 1.3 million barrels daily, dwarfing the cartel's meager 160,000 increase. I'm inclined to anticipate that the market will soon face a surplus, stirring tensions within OPEC+ that will be reminiscent of pre-pandemic dynamics.

However, this development still likely lies a year in the future. Presently, the focus should be on gauging the authenticity of the demand resurgence, with China being the linchpin. Ascertaining the real situation in China always presents challenges. Although oil imports show signs of a revival, that metric doesn't necessarily point to robust demand. China might have just been capitalizing on low oil prices to bolster reserves, a frequent tactic. With prices rising, their excess purchases may taper off.

In essence, while a resurgence to $100 per barrel is conceivable, it likely hinges on geopolitical tensions. A more plausible outlook suggests stabilization within the $70-80 range.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection is straightforward: a dip in inflation is largely tied to plummeting energy and food prices.&lt;/p&gt;

244,stocks,"AI Mania Triggers Dot-Com Bubble Flashbacks

Nvidia shares have nearly tripled this year. Investors question whether the stock can live up to the hype.

The dot-com bubble taught investors to be wary of stock-market rallies powered by a technological boom—that is, until generative artificial intelligence sent tech stocks soaring this year.

Shares of Nvidia NVDA -0.39%, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the frenzy, have nearly tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16%.

For some investors, the surge in Nvidia—now the fifth-largest U.S. company by market value—is difficult to chalk up to anything but speculative mania. Its weighting in the benchmark stock indexes means everyday investors are at the whims of its trajectory, whether they believe in AI’s potential or not.

“There’s a huge boom in AI—some people are scrambling to get exposure at any cost, while others are sounding the alarm that this will end in tears,” said Kai Wu, founder and chief investment officer of Sparkline Capital. “Investors can benefit from innovation-led growth, but must be wary of overpaying for it.”

Nvidia is the primary producer of semiconductors backing artificial-intelligence systems. The company forecast a record $11 billion in sales for the recently ended quarter when it reported results in May, catching analysts off guard with the projected surge in customer demand.

“That’s when the excitement around AI really ramped up,” said Ryan McCormack, an Invesco senior exchange-traded fund strategist. 

The hype has driven companies such as Meta Platforms and Amazon.com that have been building out AI capabilities, he said. Shares of the tech giants are up 154% and 65% in 2023, respectively. Microsoft, which has climbed 35%, has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a chatbot that can answer difficult questions in seconds.

The furious rally in those stocks, long the market’s biggest drivers, has fanned worries about market concentration. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 now comprise more than a third of the market, according to Dow Jones Market Data. They represented 27% of the index at the start of the year and less than a quarter in 2000.

“The market story that rhymes most with the internet bubble is the concentration of leadership,” said Mike Edwards, deputy chief investment officer of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers.

Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings report, due Aug. 23, will provide insight into whether its inexorable rise is well-rooted in demand for chips, or a product of hype. The stock gained 24% in the trading session after its earnings reported in May, and 14% the day following February’s results.

Investors are paying up for the shares, betting on a windfall down the line. Nvidia is trading at 41 times its sales from the last 12 months, according to FactSet, compared with 2.4 times sales for the S&amp;P 500. On a forward basis, the stock trades at 20 times its expected sales for the year ahead—double its average over the last decade of 10 times, according to Dow Jones Market Data. 

The nascency of AI programs such as ChatGPT means it is likely too early to determine whether Nvidia can raise revenue in line with the eye-watering valuation investors have slapped on its shares. If the company’s growth isn’t enough to reflect its price, the stock could crater.

A basket of 43 high-multiple internet stocks—those worth at least $5 billion that traded at 25 times their revenue at the turn of the century—crashed 80% over the next two years, according to Sparkline. 

The companies weren’t duds, either. Their sales grew 10-fold in the ensuing two decades. But investors were badly bruised from the bust: The shares returned an average of 16% in that time span. The S&amp;P 500 returned 284%.

The basket included Amazon and Microsoft, both darlings of today’s market, along with Cisco Systems, then one of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100. The networking- equipment maker traded as high as 38 times its sales in early 2000. Cisco has returned 43% since the start of the century—it is down 0.4% when excluding dividends.

“Valuations matter,” said Wu. “Investing in stocks exposed to rapidly growing technologies only works if the growth is not already priced in. Unfortunately, in periods of euphoria, the market has a tendency not only to price in potential growth, but to greatly overextrapolate it.”

One reason why this rally might lack the boom-and-bust nature of the dot-com bubble: The beneficiaries of artificial intelligence were the stocks already shining this year. Investors were flocking to big tech in the first quarter, seeking shelter in strong balance sheets and cash flows.

Tech companies are also benefiting from the expected end of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate campaign and resilient consumer spending. Cyclical sectors of the broader market have begun to catch up now that recession fears are fading. 

“It’s not like 1999 when investors were racing to hot IPOs for companies that had no chance of making money,” said Edwards. “Today’s winners are disciplined, enormous companies that have moats in place and data sets to exploit.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI Mania Triggers Dot-Com Bubble Flashbacks&lt;/p&gt;

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

247,stocks,"Sportradar (SRAD), may not be on everyone’s radar but it is certainly making waves in the market. Their Q2 2023 earnings report just dropped and the numbers are impressive.

The market has initially reacted negative to the earnings call but that may be due to FX movements hitting the bottom line. They have a lot of positives going forward.  
  
SRAD is less known compared to some giants in the industry, but it is proven itself a market leader with remarkable growth.  
  
In Q2 2023, their growth rate soared to 22%, and their year to date growth stands at an impressive 25%. They are doing all of this while maintaining profitability, something to appreciate in a volatile market.  
  
When we look at their closest rival, GENI, it’s clear SRAD is outpacing them by a significant margin. GENI achieved growth of 22% in Q2 but at a net loss of $10 million.  
SRAD sill made €10.5m profit last year after buying a bunch of companies and will hit €157 million to €167 million adjusted EBITDA this year.  
  
This contrast highlights SRAD’s ability to not only grow but also maintain a solid bottom line.  
  
One thing to note is that Q2 tends to be a slower period for sports betting stocks due to lack of major sporting events in June, so exhibiting growth during this period showcases SRAD’s resilience and strategic approach.  
  
As of 30th June 2023 SRAD had a total liquidity of €484 million including cash and cash equivalents of €264 million with an undrawn credit facility of €220 million. That is some serious spending power to further fuel their growth.  
  
Also when DKNG grows, SRAD grows as SRAD Founder &amp; CEO Carsten Koerl and DraftKings Founder Chairman &amp; CEO Jason Robins have discussed in 2020.

Why it matters: This is the final approval in both companies' quests to launch their full-fledged services throughout San Francisco.

What's happening: After several hours of public testimony, the California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday granted permits to allow both Cruise and Waymo to charge for rides around the clock in San Francisco.

Previous permits from the CPUC allowed Cruise to charge for rides between 10pm to 6am without a safety driver present, and at any time with a driver present; Waymo was only allowed to charge for rides with a safety driver.

I was reading through the Duolingo Q1 sec filing report: https://investors.duolingo.com/node/8596/html

What I understand is:

* They had 115m revenue (32m spent on cost of revenues), spent 45m on R&amp;D, 16m on marketing, 30m on general &amp; admin
* They had a 2.6m net loss
* They have 650 employees
* They had a gain of 33m in cash flow

They have one utility (educational, learn languages) app, for those unfamiliar.

What I don't understand:

* How do you manage to spend (R&amp;D and administrative) 75m on 650 employees
* How can you get to a 2.6m loss, but an increase in cash flow of 32m (up to 641m in cash and cash equivalents)

My best explanation for the second one is that it's basically increase in their stock price?

But their expenses on one utility app, to get to a 2.6m loss, is baffling? It's 650 people working on one app, get 115m in revenue per quarter and you manage to spend it all?

My best guess is that they spent a lot into trying to get their monetisation in order, since the app was not really monetising until recently: https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-monetization/

According to a new securities filing, Portnoy acquired the sports media brand he founded for just $1. Of course, there are other pieces to the deal, but the shocking sale price (Penn spent $551 million to acquire Barstool) makes for an interesting end to that relationship. Penn says that it expects to record a loss of between $800 million-$850 million on the deal. Penn of course announced a deal with ESPN to rebrand its Barstool Sportsbook as ESPN Bet, and will pay ESPN $1.5 billion and $500 million in stock warrants for the privilege. That meant abandoning the Barstool brand, which it acquired in full just earlier this year (it initially bought a stake in 2020).

&lt;p&gt;According to a new securities filing, Portnoy acquired the sports media brand he founded for just $1. Of course, there are other pieces to the deal, but the shocking sale price (Penn spent $551 million to acquire Barstool) makes for an interesting end to that relationship. Penn says that it expects to record a loss of between $800 million-$850 million on the deal. Penn of course announced a deal with ESPN to rebrand its Barstool Sportsbook as ESPN Bet, and will pay ESPN $1.5 billion and $500 million in stock warrants for the privilege. That meant abandoning the Barstool brand, which it acquired in full just earlier this year (it initially bought a stake in 2020).&lt;/p&gt;

Vermillion Energy deceptively appears to be a boring AF Canadian oil company, rightfully valued at a highly conservative P/E of 2.4 because of the thin margins of Canadian shale that will throw a company dependent on it way into the red once oil prices start to dip. Meanwhile, the stock chart looks entirely soul-crushing since 2014 and until very recently.  
  
Quite uniquely, however, one would be foolish to call Vermillion a Canadian shale company, as despite being based in Canada and having 2/3 of their yearly production in Canada, 60% of their free cash flow comes from outside of Canada.

Now because of how much money they made in 2021-22 as a result of especially elevated European pricing, they paid down their debt to less than 1x their free cash flow, and since they immediately hedged more than half of their 2023-2024 production, and since oil prices, and to a certain extent gas prices have remained high, they will again have massive profits, and this time with their very conservative debt targets reached so that they can send most of it to their shareholders.

279,stocks,"PayPal has become the first major US fintech company to offer its own crypto token with a dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD. The company is entering an extremely crowded market already dominated by stablecoins like tether and USDC, at a time when the hype over cryptocurrency has largely fizzled and prices have been mostly stable with no big run-ups since 2022. PayPal's chief crypto executive, Jose Fernandez da Ponte, believes that stablecoins are the killer application for blockchains right now. ""Stablecoins are something that we cannot just sit out,"" da Ponte added. PayPal denied a Bloomberg report that the payments processor paused development of its stablecoin in February. The market is primed for new entrants that are fully backed and unlike tether, fully regulated. PayPal's launch comes after crypto liquidity plummeted in the last year and a half. The collapse of the crypto banking trifecta rippled into the stablecoin market, with Circle's USD Coin briefly losing its peg to the U.S. dollar. The total market cap of stablecoins has plunged since its peak, dropping 25% to $120 billion. PayPal's infrastructure, including being regulated in multiple countries, risk management, and compliance, is a key asset that is a difference in the approach that the company is taking.  
  
PayPal USD is a stablecoin that is backed by dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and cash equivalents and is redeemable for dollars. It is similar to USDC and is backed by a combination of dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents. The hypothetical digital dollar, CBDC, is a digital twin of the U.S. dollar, fully regulated, under a central authority, and with the full faith and backing of the country's central bank. There are both benefits and drawbacks to these forms, with some arguing that a CBDC in the U.S. would technically be safer than privately issued stablecoins because it would present a direct claim against a central bank. However, many people who deal in stablecoins want an easier way of doing business, especially internationally. PayPal is an alternative payments network built on top of the commercial bank system, offering interoperable, transparent, and faster settlement and cross-border settlement.  
  
Stablecoins originally emerged to cater to demand for dollar exposure offshore and overseas, but nongovernmental digital tokens are increasingly being used in domestic and international transactions, which is scary for central banks. PayPal's chief crypto executive, Nic Carter, believes the payment processor has a place in the dollar-pegged stablecoin sector by enlarging the pie and offering a more accessible market. The company's competitive advantage lies in its extensive network of over 435 million active accounts, a large base of consumers and merchants, and its competitive advantage in fiat connectivity.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;PayPal has become the first major US fintech company to offer its own crypto token with a dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD. The company is entering an extremely crowded market already dominated by stablecoins like tether and USDC, at a time when the hype over cryptocurrency has largely fizzled and prices have been mostly stable with no big run-ups since 2022. PayPal&amp;#39;s chief crypto executive, Jose Fernandez da Ponte, believes that stablecoins are the killer application for blockchains right now. &amp;quot;Stablecoins are something that we cannot just sit out,&amp;quot; da Ponte added. PayPal denied a Bloomberg report that the payments processor paused development of its stablecoin in February. The market is primed for new entrants that are fully backed and unlike tether, fully regulated. PayPal&amp;#39;s launch comes after crypto liquidity plummeted in the last year and a half. The collapse of the crypto banking trifecta rippled into the stablecoin market, with Circle&amp;#39;s USD Coin briefly losing its peg to the U.S. dollar. The total market cap of stablecoins has plunged since its peak, dropping 25% to $120 billion. PayPal&amp;#39;s infrastructure, including being regulated in multiple countries, risk management, and compliance, is a key asset that is a difference in the approach that the company is taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPal USD is a stablecoin that is backed by dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and cash equivalents and is redeemable for dollars. It is similar to USDC and is backed by a combination of dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents. The hypothetical digital dollar, CBDC, is a digital twin of the U.S. dollar, fully regulated, under a central authority, and with the full faith and backing of the country&amp;#39;s central bank. There are both benefits and drawbacks to these forms, with some arguing that a CBDC in the U.S. would technically be safer than privately issued stablecoins because it would present a direct claim against a central bank. However, many people who deal in stablecoins want an easier way of doing business, especially internationally.

294,stocks,"**Datadog, Inc. (DDOG)** shares faced a significant drop in Tuesday's premarket trading.

**Why the Stock Dropped:**
The decline in Datadog's stock can be attributed to the company's revenue forecast falling short of expectations for the rest of the year.

Although Q2 results showed improvements and topped expectations, the Q3 and full-year outlook missed analyst forecasts, causing investor concerns and leading to the 20% drop in the stock.

**Q3 Forecast:**
- **Revenue:** $521 million to $525 million (below consensus of $536 million).
- **Adjusted EPS:** 33 to 35 cents (above consensus of 29 cents).

**Full-Year Outlook:**
- **Revenue:** $2.05 billion to $2.06 billion (analysts expected $2.24 billion).
- **Adjusted EPS:** $1.30 to $1.34 (analysts expected $1.18).

**Q2 Performance:**
- **Net Loss:** $4.0 million, improving from a loss of $4.88 million YoY.
- **Adjusted EPS:** 36 cents (analysts expected 28 cents).
- **Revenue:** $509.5 million, up 25% YoY (above consensus of $501.6 million).

**Customers:** Around **2,990** customers with annual recurring revenue over $100,000.

CEO Olivier Pomel highlighted strong Q2 execution, with robust revenue growth, customer increase, and multi-product adoption.

299,stocks,"Eli Lilly on Tuesday raised its full-year guidance as second-quarter profit jumped 85% from the same period a year ago on strong sales from the pharmaceutical giant's diabetes treatment Mounjaro and other drugs.

The company now expects full-year revenue of between $33.4 billion and $33.9 billion, up from a previous forecast of $31.2 billion to $31.7 billion. Eli Lilly also increased its adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $9.70 to $9.90 per share for the year, up from a range of $8.65 to $8.85.

Shares of Eli Lilly surged 14% Tuesday.

Eli Lilly beat Wall Street expectations:

* **Adjusted earnings:** $2.11 per share, vs. $1.98 per share expected
* **Revenue:** $8.31 billion, vs. $7.58 billion expected

Accounting for charges associated with some intangible assets and losses on securities, the company recorded adjusted income of $1.9 billion, or $2.11 per share.

The company's $8.31 billion in sales for the quarter marked a 28% increase from the same period a year ago. 

## Drug results

Revenue growth was also driven by sales of breast cancer pill Verzenio, which rose 57% to $926.8 million for the quarter. Sales of Jardiance, a tablet that lowers blood sugar in Type 2 diabetes patients, climbed 45% to $668.3 million for the second quarter.

Newer drugs like Mounjaro, the company's Type 2 diabetes injection, also fueled revenue growth, posting $979.7 million in sales for the quarter. The drug was first approved in the U.S. in May 2022 and notched just $16 million in sales in the year-ago period. 

Investors have pinned high hopes on Mounjaro's potential mega-blockbuster trajectory beyond diabetes, with some research suggesting that it may be even more effective at reducing weight than Novo Nordisk's popular Wegovy and Ozempic injections.

Last month, Eli Lilly filed for Food and Drug Administration approval of the injection for chronic weight management.

Eli Lilly said it ""has experienced and continues to expect intermittent delays fulfilling orders of certain Mounjaro doses given significant demand.""

## Pipeline and acquisitions

Eli Lilly's stock has been on a tear in recent months, driven in part by positive trial results for its Alzheimer's drug, donanemab, and the company's progress with its promising obesity drug pipeline.

Shares of Eli Lilly are up more than 24% for the year. With a market value of roughly $431 billion, Eli Lilly is the second-largest pharmaceutical company based in the U.S. after Johnson &amp; Johnson.

301,stocks,"Moody’s cut the credit ratings of a host of small and mid-sized U.S. banks late Monday and placed several big Wall Street names on negative review.

The firm lowered the ratings of 10 banks by one rung, while major lenders Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, State Street, Truist Financial, Cullen/Frost Bankers and Northern Trust are now under review for a potential downgrade.

Moody’s also changed its outlook to negative for 11 banks, including Capital One, Citizens Financial and Fifth Third Bancorp.

Among the smaller lenders receiving an official ratings downgrade were M&amp;T Bank, Pinnacle Financial, BOK Financial and Webster Financial

“U.S. banks continue to contend with interest rate and asset-liability management (ALM) risks with implications for liquidity and capital, as the wind-down of unconventional monetary policy drains systemwide deposits and higher interest rates depress the value of fixed-rate assets,” Moody’s analysts Jill Cetina and Ana Arsov said in the accompanying research note.

“Meanwhile, many banks’ Q2 results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital. This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline from solid but unsustainable levels, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios.”

Regional U.S. banks were thrust into the spotlight earlier this year after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank triggered a run on deposits across the sector. The panic eventually spread to Europe and resulted in the emergency rescue of Swiss giant Credit Suisse by domestic rival UBS.

# [Stock futures fall with bank shares under pressure from Moody’s downgrade: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/07/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures retreated Tuesday as a decline in bank shares dampened investor sentiment.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked lower by 191 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.5% each.
*****
&gt; Bank shares fell broadly after Moody’s downgraded the credit rating on several banks, including M&amp;T Bank and Pinnacle Financial. The credit agency also placed Bank of N.Y. Mellon and State Street on review for a downgrade.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase traded lower in the premarket. The SPDR S&amp;P Bank ETF (KBE) slipped 2.3% in the premarket, while the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) dipped 2%.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continued. UPS shares dropped more than 5% after the delivery giant reported weaker-than-expected revenue for the second quarter. The company also lowered its full-year revenue outlook. Educational tech company Chegg popped about 23% after reporting second-quarter revenue of $183 million, beating analysts’ estimate of $177 million, per Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; The corporate earnings season has so far been better-than-expected. Roughly 86% of S&amp;P 500 stocks have reported quarterly results, and nearly 80% of them have beaten Wall Street’s expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; “The good news is that the earnings trough/recession is likely coming to an end, with earnings growth expected to accelerate over the coming quarters,” said Dylan Kremer, co-chief investment officer at Certuity. “Looking ahead, earnings projections seem a bit lofty to us relative to revenue growth estimates, particularly starting in Q1/24.”
*****
&gt; On the economic data front, traders are looking ahead to July’s consumer price index report, out Thursday. The inflation metric could put Wall Street’s belief in a soft landing to the test. Economists polled by Dow Jones are calling for a monthly increase of 0.2% in July and a year-over-year rise of 3.3%.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a strong performance Monday. The 30-stock Dow surged more than 400 points, or nearly 1.2%, for its best day since June 15. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%, and S&amp;P 500 closed higher by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 broke four-straight sessions of losses.

&lt;p&gt;Stock futures retreated Tuesday as a decline in bank shares dampened investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked lower by 191 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.5% each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank shares fell broadly after Moody’s downgraded the credit rating on several banks, including M&amp;amp;T Bank and Pinnacle Financial. The credit agency also placed Bank of N.Y. Mellon and State Street on review for a downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase traded lower in the premarket. The SPDR S&amp;amp;P Bank ETF (KBE) slipped 2.3% in the premarket, while the SPDR S&amp;amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) dipped 2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings season continued. UPS shares dropped more than 5% after the delivery giant reported weaker-than-expected revenue for the second quarter. The company also lowered its full-year revenue outlook. Educational tech company Chegg popped about 23% after reporting second-quarter revenue of $183 million, beating analysts’ estimate of $177 million, per Refinitiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corporate earnings season has so far been better-than-expected. Roughly 86% of S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks have reported quarterly results, and nearly 80% of them have beaten Wall Street’s expectations, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The good news is that the earnings trough/recession is likely coming to an end, with earnings growth expected to accelerate over the coming quarters,” said Dylan Kremer, co-chief investment officer at Certuity. “Looking ahead, earnings projections seem a bit lofty to us relative to revenue growth estimates, particularly starting in Q1/24.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the economic data front, traders are looking ahead to July’s consumer price index report, out Thursday. The inflation metric could put Wall Street’s belief in a soft landing to the test. Economists polled by Dow Jones are calling for a monthly increase of 0.2% in July and a year-over-year rise of 3.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is coming off a strong performance Monday. The 30-stock Dow surged more than 400 points, or nearly 1.2%, for its best day since June 15. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%, and S&amp;amp;P 500 closed higher by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&amp;amp;P 500 broke four-straight sessions of losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paramount Global&lt;/strong&gt; — The media conglomerate’s shares climbed more than 2% in premarket trading after the company reported a quarterly earnings and revenue beat. Paramount said its streaming segment continued to grow, with about 61 million subscribers by the end of the quarter. Subscription revenue grew more than 47% to $1.22 billion. The firm also agreed to sell book publisher Simon &amp;amp; Schuster to KKR for $1.62 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

317,stocks,"Paramount's earnings were rough. They swung to a net loss of $299 million compared to a profit last year. Ouch.

The main culprit? Investing tons of cash into streaming content for Paramount+ while revenue dropped in other areas like movies. Double ouch.

But hey, at least streaming subs are way up to 61 million. And adjusted earnings were still slightly in the black at $80 million.

As for debt, it ticked up to $15.8 billion. Not ideal but expected with all the spending on streaming. Credit ratings remain investment grade for now.

The real test is 2024. That's when Paramount says streaming will turn profitable and cash flow positive. 

Debt maturities look manageable until 2025. But Paramount needs to show progress on profits and cash flow next year. Otherwise, downgrades could happen.

So in summary - rough results today but folks are betting big on the streaming pivot panning out down the road. Risky strategy but no guts, no glory. We'll see how it shakes out.

Tesla
’s chief financial officer, Zach Kirkhorn, stepped down from his position, effective Aug. 4, the automaker announced Monday morning in a regulatory filing. Tesla’s chief accounting officer Vaibhav Taneja was appointed as the new CFO and will hold both roles concurrently.

Shares of Tesla were trading down about 2.5% on the news.

Kirkhorn will stay on with Tesla through the end of the year to assist in the transition, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Kirkhorn had served as CFO since March 2019 and had worked for Tesla since 2010.

“As I shift my responsibilities to support this transition, I want to thank the talented, passionate, and hard-working employees at Tesla, who have accomplished things many thought not possible,” Kirkhorn wrote on LinkedIn.

Kirkhorn’s departure marks the second CFO replacement at Tesla in just over four years. When prior CFO Deepak Ahuja left Tesla in 2019, shares dipped as much as 4.5%.

Vaibhav Taneja, Kirkhorn’s replacement and Tesla’s former chief accounting officer, has been with the automaker since 2017. He worked for SolarCity before joining Tesla, by way of the automaker’s $2.6 billion acquisition of the solar installer. Before that, Taneja was employed at PwC for about 17 years.

I have a questions regarding IRA Contributions, gains and associated taxes. I read that any contributions I make are withdrawable tax-free at any time. Any gains I make in that account are withdrawable tax-free only after I have owned the account for 5 years AND after I am over 59.5 years old


Main question: are any gains non-taxable after the criteria are met? If I kept depositing 1k a year from age 30, but my account value at age 60 is 200k, I withdraw the entire 200k free of any tax? No income, capital gains, nothing?



Second scenario: I contribute 1k from age 30 to 34, so 4k total. In this time, trading stocks, options, whatever, the total value has become 8k, so a total 4k gain. Can I withdraw 4k ( my contribution) tax-free, and leave the other 4k in the account to just grow till I'm 59.5?

Now, I can't withdraw a single cent before the age of 59.5 without paying taxes - right?



And if I had to withdraw all 8k, then 4k would be tax-free, and what about that other 4k, the ""gains""? What rate are they taxed- would it be income tax bracket, or some other %?

The U.S. Federal Reserve will likely need to raise interest rates further to bring down inflation, Governor Michelle Bowman said on Saturday. Bowman said she supported the Fed’s quarter-point increase in interest rates last month, given still-high inflation, strong consumer spending, a rebound in the housing market and a labor market that is helping to feed higher prices. “I also expect that additional rate increases will likely be needed to get inflation on a path down to the FOMC’s 2 percent target,” she said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Kansas Bankers Association, referring to the Fed’s rate-setting panel, the Federal Open Market Committee.

Monetary policy is not on a “preset course,” she also said, and data will drive future decisions. “We should remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting if the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled.” Bowman has frequently expressed views that are more hawkish than some of her colleagues. In forecasts published in June, most Fed policymakers expected to end the year with the Fed policy rate at 5.6%, one quarter-point hike above the setting established at the Fed’s late-July meeting. Bowman’s use of the plural “rate increases” in her remarks on Saturday indicates she thinks the Fed will need to go higher than that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/05/feds-bowman-says-more-us-rate-hikes-likely-will-be-needed.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/05/feds-bowman-says-more-us-rate-hikes-likely-will-be-needed.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

335,stocks,"This week's casual valuation is **HelloFresh**. I've received many requests to cover it as it is one of the largest positions in my portfolio (13.5%).

In this post, I'll share everything that there's to share from my side, but please do not treat this as financial/investment advice. If you want to make any decision, please do your homework.

The post will be divided into the following segments:

* Introduction
* The business model
* Historical financial performance
* The balance sheet
* The 2025 target (provided by the management)
* Assumptions &amp; valuation
* Valuation based on assumptions different than mine

**Introduction**

For those who are not familiar, HelloFresh is a company operating in a niche market. It is a direct-to-consumers company, that delivers meal kits &amp; ready-to-eat meals.

**A meal kit** is a combination of a recipe and all the ingredients required to make the meal. Once a week, the customer can choose the recipes, and everything gets delivered in a box to their doorstep.

**A ready-to-eat-meal**, is well, pretty much the same, except there's no cooking to be done.

Other than its own brand HelloFresh, it has acquired other smaller companies in the past, such as Factor\_, Green Chef, Chef's Plate, and YouFoodz. These are companies that operate in the same industry, and the company uses its know-how to scale them up, by increasing capacity, but also expanding in other countries.

Other than selling meals, it also sells soups, desserts, bakery products, salads, etc.

A tiny portion of their revenue comes in the form of fees for including some marketing material of other companies (offering discounts for example) in the box sent to the final customer. This is not a significant portion, but the margins are 100%. Adding a couple of flyers in a box doesn't take that much space, and other companies would pay to target a certain geographical area for their products/services.

&amp;#x200B;

**The business model**

The company operates based on a pull model, meaning the first step is done by the customers, choosing the recipes, and placing the order. Between that day, and the delivery (in the Netherlands, the deadline for ordering is Wednesday, and delivery is being done during the weekend), HelloFresh:

* Orders all the ingredients
* Gets all the ingredients delivered to their fulfillment centers
* Orders are being packaged &amp; sorted for delivery

There has been a lot of investment done in automation in advanced assembly lines, so the fulfillment centers are in pretty good shape.

The capex reached its peak in 2022 and is expected to decrease every year over the next 3 years. The main reason for this is the infrastructure that is already in place as it is sufficient to support €10b in revenue (the last twelve months' revenue is €8b).

There are 7.1m customers (assuming 1 customer = 1 household), representing roughly a 2% penetration rate, comparing it against the 322m households in the countries where the company operates. A high penetration rate should not be assumed, as this is a very niche market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

The company has roughly €8b in revenue (vs. €4.3b market cap), with a gross margin of 26%. The direct costs are related to:

* Ingredients
* Packaging
* Delivery

After taking the marketing &amp; G&amp;A expenses into account, the operating margin is around 3%. So, why would I invest in a company of this kind?

I expect the margins, and the free cash flow to grow. Here's my rationale:

If you take a look at the 3 direct costs, it can be argued that **ingredients and packaging** will grow hand in hand with the more orders the company has, leading to higher gross profit, but same margins.

However, **delivery** doesn't grow at the same pace. Imagine if one of their vans needs to transport 10 packages to one neighborhood, Now, if the same van has to transport 12 packages, the cost would not increase by 20%. The van has already made the majority of the journey.

This means, **the more customers there are in a certain geographical region, the higher the margins are**. In the mature markets where the company operates, the operating margin is between **8%-10%** (in some, the operating margin is even 12%, but this is too high to use for long-term assumptions).

I am a customer of HelloFresh, this is how I got introduced to this public company. If someone is happy with the product/service, there's no additional marketing expense required to keep them satisfied. Therefore, I expect the marketing expense to decrease as % of revenue over time. The management shared the 2025 targets, and we'll come back to this.

&amp;#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

The company has almost €0.5b in cash, which is solid, with very low accounts receivable (€17m) which is expected, as the customers pay almost at the same time as the delivery. This means the company has almost no risk of not getting paid.

In addition, as there operate in order cycles, they hold very little inventory (€250m), consisting of fresh ingredients and packaging materials.

On the other side of the balance sheet, it is worth mentioning that they have around €0.7b in debt, including leases, as they lease some of the fulfillment centers in the US, Sweden, Canada, Australia, and the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

**The 2025 target**

The management shared the 2025 targets, and the summary is as follows:

* Revenue growth to €10b
* Gross profit 26% --&gt; 29%
* Marketing expense (as % of revenue) 18% --&gt; 16%
* Operating profit 3% --&gt; 8%

Today, we have a company with low profitability and high capex (to increase its capacity), and as of 2024/2025, we'll have a company with modest profitability and much lower capex. Based on my assumptions, I expect a significant increase in the free cash flow.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumptions &amp; Valuation**

However, only because the management has certain targets, doesn't mean that is exactly what is going to happen.

My assumptions are more conservative:

* **Revenue growth** of 5% for the next year, reducing to 2.5% over time (the €10b revenue target of the management is hit in 2028)
* **Operating margin** slowly improving, reaching 8% in 2027
* **A discount rate** of 8.7%

After adjusting for what is on their balance sheet, as well as the equity options outstanding, the value of HelloFresh is roughly €6b (€34.5/share).

For comparison, the company's market cap is €4.3b (€24.5/share).

Based on my assumptions, the IRR that the company offers is **12.7%.**

For those who are interested in multiples, based on my assumptions, at year 10, the terminal value is multiple of the FCF at year 10 x 17.8.

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**

Of course, the future is uncertain and my assumptions could be significantly wrong. Let's take a look at how the valuation (per share) changes if we use different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue / Operating margin|6%|8%|10%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|40% (€10.8b)|€23.0|€32.7|€41.3|
|51% (€11.6b)|€23.9|**€34.5**|€43.5|
|100% (€15.4b)|€27.7|€41.4|€53.7|

The €34.5 is the fair value based on my assumptions. If you take a look at the sensitivity, for example, the 6% operating margin column, there's not that much difference if the company grows by 40% over the next decade, or by 100% (€23.0 vs. €27.7).

However, if you take a look at the first row, the valuation changes significantly. As this is a low-margin business, one of the main tasks of the management is to expand margins.

Therefore, the main risk around the company is its margins. If the management doesn't succeed to expand the margins, the impact on the valuation is significant.

My rationale is that as the company gets more customers in the existing geographical regions, the costs per order will decrease. In addition, the reduced marketing expense (as % of revenue) and reduced capex will increase the FCF significantly over the next two years.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#39;s casual valuation is &lt;strong&gt;HelloFresh&lt;/strong&gt;.

If someone is happy with the product/service, there&amp;#39;s no additional marketing expense required to keep them satisfied. Therefore, I expect the marketing expense to decrease as % of revenue over time. The management shared the 2025 targets, and we&amp;#39;ll come back to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The balance sheet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has almost €0.5b in cash, which is solid, with very low accounts receivable (€17m) which is expected, as the customers pay almost at the same time as the delivery. This means the company has almost no risk of not getting paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, as there operate in order cycles, they hold very little inventory (€250m), consisting of fresh ingredients and packaging materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the balance sheet, it is worth mentioning that they have around €0.7b in debt, including leases, as they lease some of the fulfillment centers in the US, Sweden, Canada, Australia, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 2025 target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The management shared the 2025 targets, and the summary is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue growth to €10b&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross profit 26% --&amp;gt; 29%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing expense (as % of revenue) 18% --&amp;gt; 16%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating profit 3% --&amp;gt; 8%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we have a company with low profitability and high capex (to increase its capacity), and as of 2024/2025, we&amp;#39;ll have a company with modest profitability and much lower capex. Based on my assumptions, I expect a significant increase in the free cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumptions &amp;amp; Valuation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, only because the management has certain targets, doesn&amp;#39;t mean that is exactly what is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My assumptions are more conservative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue growth&lt;/strong&gt; of 5% for the next year, reducing to 2.5% over time (the €10b revenue target of the management is hit in 2028)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating margin&lt;/strong&gt; slowly improving, reaching 8% in 2027&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A discount rate&lt;/strong&gt; of 8.7%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for what is on their balance sheet, as well as the equity options outstanding, the value of HelloFresh is roughly €6b (€34.5/share).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the company&amp;#39;s market cap is €4.3b (€24.5/share).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on my assumptions, the IRR that the company offers is &lt;strong&gt;12.7%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are interested in multiples, based on my assumptions, at year 10, the terminal value is multiple of the FCF at year 10 x 17.8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valuation based on assumptions different than mine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the future is uncertain and my assumptions could be significantly wrong. Let&amp;#39;s take a look at how the valuation (per share) changes if we use different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Revenue / Operating margin&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;6%&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;8%&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;10%&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;40% (€10.8b)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;€23.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;€32.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;€41.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;51% (€11.6b)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;€23.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;€34.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;€43.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;100% (€15.4b)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;€27.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;€41.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;€53.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The €34.5 is the fair value based on my assumptions. If you take a look at the sensitivity, for example, the 6% operating margin column, there&amp;#39;s not that much difference if the company grows by 40% over the next decade, or by 100% (€23.0 vs. €27.7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you take a look at the first row, the valuation changes significantly. As this is a low-margin business, one of the main tasks of the management is to expand margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the main risk around the company is its margins. If the management doesn&amp;#39;t succeed to expand the margins, the impact on the valuation is significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rationale is that as the company gets more customers in the existing geographical regions, the costs per order will decrease. In addition, the reduced marketing expense (as % of revenue) and reduced capex will increase the FCF significantly over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;

337,stocks,"The pandemic showered Pfizer with record sales. Now the end of the crisis is dragging the drugmaker down.

Its Covid-19 vaccine and drug powered Pfizer to more than $100 billion in sales last year, the first drugmaker to break the barrier. Shares soared, as Wall Street hailed the company for its savvy, fast and ultimately lucrative pivot to taking on the virus.

But many people have moved on from the pandemic. Sales from the two products dropped so much, so rapidly they contributed to Pfizer’s overall sales falling sizably in its most recent quarter compared with the period a year earlier. The company dialed back the top end of its expectations for the full-year performance.

Shares are down 31% this year to date, a loss of more than $88 billion in market capitalization. The company’s valuation has dropped by $144 billion since its 2021 peak.

Pfizer is hitting a rough spot after its Covid-19 sales nosedived and while it waits for new drugs and recent deal-making to pay off. Adding to the straits: the loss of an estimated $17 billion in annual sales by the end of the decade, when some of the company’s biggest sellers, like arthritis treatment Xeljanz, lose patent protection. 

The New York-based company has talked up plans to increase revenue through a bevy of new drug approvals and their launches. It also has been using its Covid-19 cash to secure other products for its lineup. It predicts more than $10 billion in 2030 sales from its $43 billion proposed deal to buy cancer-drug biotech Seagen, as it leans more into cancer drugs. 

Executives also have other dials they can turn to tune up the company’s performance, such as cutting costs and some drug research programs.

Yet executing means Pfizer must overcome factors outside its control. The Federal Trade Commission is reviewing the agreement to buy Seagen, while drugs in late-stage development must pass testing and get green lights from the Food and Drug Administration.

And Pfizer’s ambitious expectations for launches of new products might be difficult to pull off in today’s tightfisted healthcare environment.

Pfizer has “gotten a lot of things over the finish line, and there’s still some more to go, but they’re asking a lot of those products to contribute in a relatively narrow time frame before year end,” Barclays analyst Carter Gould said. 

Sales of drugs from recent acquisitions, including migraine drug Nurtec and sickle-cell disease treatment Oxbryta, have been slow to accumulate, said Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger. “The market demand has been somewhat softer than expected for both of them,” he said.

The predicament is customary for big pharmaceutical companies, which regularly confront the ups and downs of patent-dependent franchises. Pfizer has plenty of experience navigating through sales drops for impotence pill Viagra, cholesterol fighter Lipitor and other erstwhile juggernauts.

Playing a role this time is Pfizer’s decision to slim down and become a growth stock. Before the pandemic hit, the drugmaker had shed slower-growing businesses, losing the cushion of their steady cash flows, to focus on higher-growth but more volatile prescription drugs.

The strategy paid off handsomely during the pandemic. Shares reached a record high of roughly $61 in December 2021 as the Omicron variant spread throughout the world and Pfizer shipped billions of Covid-19 shots. Pfizer developed the shot with Germany’s BioNTech.

The return to Earth has been abrupt. Earlier this year, Pfizer said it expects its Covid-19 vaccine to generate $13.5 billion in sales in 2023, down roughly two-thirds from last year. The company said its Paxlovid antiviral would bring in about $8 billion in sales this year, down 58% from last year. 

Sales for the products are lower this year because governments have purchased fewer contracts and the U.S. is transitioning to a commercial market. Doctors are also writing fewer Paxlovid prescriptions. 

“A key driver will be the magnitude of the next Covid wave and whether it drives people to be vaccinated at a higher rate or not,” Risinger said. “Covid fatigue and vaccine hesitancy adds additional uncertainty about what the future demand will be for Covid vaccinations.” 

Pfizer said last week, when reporting quarterly earnings, that it should have more clarity on future demand for its pandemic products by the end of the year. By then, it will have rolled out its latest Covid-19 shot through the traditional commercial market. 

Should sales fail to materialize, Pfizer is prepared to trim R&amp;D spending for Covid-19 and other disease areas, Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in an interview.  

“We are moving post-Covid,” Bourla said.

Pfizer lowered its growth-rate target for this year, citing the FDA’s decision to approve a cancer drug for a smaller patient population than the company expected and the federal government’s recommendation for a new RSV vaccine falling short of company expectations.

Recent damage from a tornado to a North Carolina manufacturing plant might also jeopardize sales, Chief Financial Officer David Denton said. 

To date this year, the FDA has approved four Pfizer medicines. The company is more than halfway through its goal of rolling out 19 new drugs or expanded uses over 18 months through the first half of 2024. 

An experimental multiple myeloma drug called elranatamab that is up for FDA approval could generate about $1 billion in sales in 2030, according to Jefferies analyst Akash Tewari.

In the past year, the company has faced challenges in improving its income. Despite experiencing a 20% decrease in revenue (without accounting for the 100% inflation rate) during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the previous quarter, and with expenses rising between 9% to 17%, the company managed to report a positive operating income. Notably, they had an unusually high CAPEX due to the acquisition of ""Central Costanera,"" which contributes approximately 3% of Argentina's installed capacity.We all acknowledge that the Argentine energy sector has been an unattractive investment due to the government's restrictive regulatory framework, resulting in insufficient investments to meet the country's energy demands. However, there are promising signs of potential change in this regard.  

Firstly, the outlook for Argentina's political future is highly optimistic. The recent announcements of presidential candidates from both major political parties, advocating a shift towards a free market economy and emphasizing the independence of the Argentine central bank from the treasury, have had a profound impact on the markets. As evidenced by the 30% surge in Argentine bonds in June, there is a growing positive sentiment and increased investor confidence in the potential direction of the country's economy.  

Secondly, Argentina's recent agreement with the IMF will provide the country with an additional credit of 7.5 billion dollars. This new arrangement indicates that the IMF will likely impose conditions aimed at achieving fiscal surpluses and implementing monetary tightening, with the ultimate goal of reducing inflation rates.

Could a lot of institutions have thrown in the towel on Friday and did huge VWAP sell orders for the mega caps during the premarket and bought treasury bonds with the proceeds? I ask this because the advance decline ratio was very positive until after European close and lunchtime. I assume a big positive advance decline number is from manual buying of many stocks by fund managers. After European close and lunchtime, do these fund managers call it a week in terms of active buying? Then the computer driven VWAP orders that were in place at the start of the day are the sole source of movement which is downwards.

The market was down from Monday to Thursday. Could a lot of institutions have thrown in the towel on Friday and did huge VWAP sell orders for the mega caps during the premarket and bought treasury bonds with the proceeds? I ask this because the advance decline ratio was very positive until after European close and lunchtime. I assume a big positive advance decline number is from manual buying of many stocks by fund managers. After European close and lunchtime, do these fund managers call it a week in terms of active buying? Then the computer driven VWAP orders that were in place at the start of the day are the sole source of movement which is downwards.

342,stocks,"**About the company**  
  
Cactus Inc. (WHD) makes and sells wellheads and pressure control equipment to the oil and gas industry. It also sells flexible piping through its FlexSteel unit. The company was founded in 2011. It currently has a market cap of $4.11 billion and pays a 0.85% dividend.   
  
**Management**  
  
The CEO, Scott Bender, is a co-founder of the company and has been CEO for its entire existence. His brother Joel is also an executive and has been with the company sincere co-founded it. Management owns about 20% of the company, so they are aligned with shareholder interests.  
  
**Segments and growth**  
  
Cactus is a critical supplier for oilfield operations. They make and install well heads for new oil wells. Their technology makes the process safer and more efficient than the competition. Once cactus installs their pressure systems they collect servicing fees for the life of the well. They also rent equipment to the E&amp;P companies. About 33% of their legacy business comes from these recurring sources and 66% from the wellhead installations.  
  
Earlier this year, Cactus acquired Flexsteel, a maker of flexible pipe. This allows them access to a tangential market and has been immediately accretive to free cash flow.  
  
Cactus has several growth tailwinds. The flex steel acquisition is still being integrated into the company. This will continue to add free cash flow to the balance sheet. US oil drillers are going strong and Cactus will keep getting revenue from their operations. Also, Cactus is developing products for new markets. They are branching into carbon sequestration too. They opened their first sequestration project in 2022 and have several more in the works. They are also making efforts to leverage Flex steel to get into the midstream market and, more importantly, into offshore drilling. The offshore drilling market is projected to grow at a 7-8% CAGR for the next decade plus, so this is a big growth opportunity for the company. They currently have limited offshore offerings.  
  
Lastly, the company authorized a $100 million buyback plan. This will benefit investors if they can continue it longer term, and based on their cash flows, this is likely.  
  
**Performance and balance sheet**  
  
WHD currently has a ROE of 21% with a five year average of 34%. Its current ROIC is 18% with a five year average of 22%. Both those averages are skewed by huge numbers in 2018 and low figures in 2020. This is reflective of the cyclical nature of the energy sector. Their 2020 ROE was around 10%, which isn’t too bad for an oil services company in a pandemic. I’d consider the company to be a good allocator of capital.   
  
The company has a solid balance sheet. Total debt is $189.81 million, which is less than 1 year of free cash flow.  This level of debt is easily manageable, even in a downturn. Much of the debt was due to their Flex steel acquisition and will be paid down.

**Risks**

Like most energy related businesses, Cactus is at the risk of the commodity cycles. If oil prices decline there will likely be less investment into wells and Cactus will see its business shrink. The fact that they stayed profitable in 2020 does illustrate the durability of the business though.   
  
**Valuation**  
  
WHD is trading at around 23x current earnings and 15x forward earnings. It has been seeing its earnings rebound consistently since the 2020 lows. Its 5 year p/e range is 6-60 (energy has been volatile). Analysts are forecasting double digit EPS growth going forward, but this is subject to energy prices. It has a PEG of 0.97. A deep recession or a decline in oil prices would definitely be bad for Cactus’ business.   
  
Morningstar has fair value at $59.15 and it has been climbing, making the stock slightly undervalued even after its recent run.  I have a fair value in the mid $50s. I don't generally share my fair value assumptions since they are, well, assumptions and I'd urge anyone interested to use their own numbers as well. The stock has been on a run recently too, so there is a risk of a pullback soon. The company will also be releasing earnings on August 7th which could cause additional volitility.  
  
If you believe that oil will be a booming market for the foreseeable future, I think that shares are well priced. Cactus is a company that is founder led and management has a large stake in its success. With high ROE and new products coming to market, I think Cactus can continue to grow.

I currently have no stake in WHD.

Opendoor/Offerpad (OPEN/OPAD) there is definitely some value in iBuying I think. (iBuying is where a company buys a home to flip for profit). Zillow and Redfin ended their iBuying businesses, so obviously iBuying is a super risky, capital heavy business model. But if there’s a company that can figure out how to do it profitably then the sky is the limit.  There’s just too much bullshit in trying to sell a home with all the fees, listing it for sale, scheduling tours, etc.  There’s definitely going to be a good number of people who just want to skip the bullshit and receive a fair cash offer for their home to sell it the next day, especially people who need to sell quickly. All real estate stocks have gotten crushed because people are afraid of an imminent real estate market crash, but if we can look past the upcoming crash, and  if Opendoor or offerpad are still around and prove that iBuying is legit, then these will easily be 10x returns or more. This is a asymmetric risk play 

Redfin (RDFN)- sort of a hedge to Opendoor/ Offerpad since they ended their iBuying business. After the real estate market gets crushed and recovers, they should do well. They have the lowest fees for selling I house I think. 

Ginkgo Bioworks (DNA) - Cathy Wood’s favorite penny stock. They basically program cells for all sorts or products, vaccines, and foods. Seems like they have a bunch of partnerships. Once they engineer living cells for clients they store the cell’s design in a database or foundry to sell to other clients or build, test, and automate more organism engineering. Could be the amazon of biotech or the AWS of biological engineering. 

Matterport (MTTR) - they make those machines that take 3D scans of a building or home to make a “digital twin”. Used a lot for real estate agents selling homes which might do well after real estate demand picks up. There are other products like it, but it’s seems like the hardware/software has the best reputation. They store all the “digital twins” in a database that they could possibly monetize well someday. The “digital twins” should work well in the Metaverse as we digitally recreate the physical world. I know Metaverse was the hype buzzword from 2022 that was replaced by the AI buzzword this year, but hopefully the metaverse is still on its way. I mean apple is releasing its headset next year 

Riot platforms / Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA/RIOT): these are Bitcoin miners. We might look back 5-10 years from now and realize that bitcoin/Ethereum is a scam or vaporware, but the price action from the last year or two is right in-line with previous bitcoin cycles as we get closer to the bitcoin having next year. If bitcoin/ethereum achieve even half of its mission or intended purpose in the long term then these stocks should be multi-baggers, right? 

Chargepoint/ EvGo(CHPT/EVGO): I mean don’t we need as many charging stations as possible for our electric vehicle future?  Do we really think Tesla will be the only prevalent charging station network? 

Enphase (ENPH): I mean, would any of us not install solar panels on our homes at the right price? I feel like this will fall to the $120 support level after that last earnings report but then proceed to 10x over the next decade

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 7th, 2023.

# **S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq tumble for four straight days, notch worst weeks since March: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/03/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slumped Friday for a fourth straight session, and notched their worst weeks since March, as traders seemed to book profits following the latest corporate earnings releases and U.S. jobs data.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.53% to finish at 4,478.03, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.36% to settle at 13,909.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 150.27 points, or 0.43%, to end at 35,065.62.
*****
&gt; All the major indexes reversed earlier gains during afternoon trading, and finished the week with losses. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P dropped about 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively, to notch their worst weeks since March. The Dow edged down 1.1%.
*****
&gt; “People this week seem more respectful of risk than they were before,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, adding that “lots of bears have been capitulating, which is often a sign that we’re closer to the end of a rally than the beginning.”
*****
&gt; After being lower on the day, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) rose to trade above 16 — pointing to investors adding volatility protection.
*****
&gt; Friday marked the final day of what’s been the busiest week of second-quarter earnings season. Amazon jumped 8.3% to its highest level in nearly a year after trouncing expectations on profit and offering positive guidance. Apple lost 4.8% after reporting lower revenue than the year-ago quarter. Both tech giants reported results late Thursday.
*****
&gt; In a sign of the boom in travel and services demand, Booking Holdings gained 7.9% on stronger-than-expected results. Amgen popped 5.5% on solid earnings and a boosted guidance.
*****
&gt; Earnings reports this season for the quarter ended in June have continued to surprise some Wall Street analysts as the expected slowdown in profits proves less than feared. About 84% of S&amp;P 500 companies have given results, with 80% surpassing Wall Street expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield also pulled back from a multimonth high to 4.04%. Its rise in recent sessions had pressured risk assets.
*****
&gt; # A cooler jobs report

&gt; Investors also received more clues into the state of the labor market with Friday’s payrolls report. The data showed 187,000 jobs added in July, less than the 200,000 expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. The unemployment rate also ticked lower to 3.5% from 3.6%.
*****
&gt; Despite the cooler headline numbers, average hourly wages pointed toward more inflation and came in ahead of expectations, rising 0.4% for the month, and 4.4% on an annualized basis. That came in slightly ahead of the 0.3% and 4.2% expected, respectively.
*****
&gt; Many on Wall Street had been eagerly awaiting the jobs report and its implications for the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking cycle. About 88% of traders expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its next meeting in September, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; But next week’s consumer price report for July could make an even greater impact on rate expectations, said Wells Fargo’s Christopher Harvey.
*****
&gt; “A hotter-than-expected print is one of the few things that could really start to change the market’s perception of the Fed, and maybe the Fed’s perception as well,” he said. “But today’s job number, I don’t think does much of anything. I think it solidifies people’s view that the Fed is done at this point.”

&gt; # The Economy is Normalizing, and That’s a Good Thing

&gt; The economy created 187,000 jobs in July, slightly softer than the 200,000 that economists expected. The last couple of months were revised lower, and so it’s always helpful to take a 3-month average, which is now running at 218,000. That’s stronger than the pre-pandemic average of 183,000.

&gt; In short, job growth remains strong. You will hear some people heralding this as the onset of a recession, but more likely this is just normalization of the economy rather than weakness. The report aligns with what we wrote in our Mid-Year 2023 Outlook, not to mention the title: “Edging Closer to Normal”.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-payrolls-601x800.png))**

&gt; The private sector created 172,000 jobs in July, up from 128,000 in June. On a sector level, job growth this year has been driven by non-cyclical areas like health care, education, and government. These sectors had lagged in the early recovery, accounting for just 13% of jobs created in 2021, and 25% in 2022. Over the first 7 months of this year, they’ve accounted for more than 50% of jobs created. July didn’t buck that trend, with health care seeing 100,000 jobs created. Government jobs were on the softer side, rising 15,000 in July versus an average of 53,000 between April and June.

&gt; The cyclical areas of the economy, especially construction, manufacturing, and leisure and hospitality, remain on the softer side, with job growth adding up to 34,000 across these three sectors. So far this year, these sectors have accounted for about 20% of job creation (not exactly “weak”), versus 36% in 2022 and 43% in 2021.

&gt; Again, the theme is normalization.

&gt; **The Best Labor Market Since the Late 1990s**

&gt; The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, not far from 50+ year lows of 3.4%. What is amazing is that the unemployment rate is slightly below where it was in June 2023, when the Fed really started to get aggressive with rate hikes.

&gt; The unemployment rate can be impacted by people leaving the labor force (technically defined as those “not looking for work”) and an aging population. I’ve discussed in prior blogs how we can get around this by looking at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e. workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population. Think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you also get around the demographic issue.

&gt; The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio remained at 80.9%. That is higher than at any point since May 2001. It was actually falling at that time, and didn’t recover until now. This is the best indication that the labor market remains very healthy, and probably in the best shape since the late 1990s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-employment-population-ratio-612x800.png))**

&gt; **Bottom Line: All Signs Point to a Strong Economy**

&gt; The US economy runs on consumption, and for that you need income. The good news is that income growth appears to remain strong and looks to be running ahead of inflation. In fact, wage growth rose 0.4% in July. Monthly numbers can be volatile, but the 3-month annualized pace is 4.9%.

&gt; You combine strong wage growth with strong employment, and that translates to strong income gains across the entire economy. Over the last 3 months, overall income growth for all workers is running at a 5.3% annual pace. Meanwhile, headline inflation is running close to 2.0%. The difference between the two tells you how fast incomes are growing after adjusting for inflation, and that’s running above a 3% annual pace over the past 3 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-real-income-growth-584x800.png))** 

&gt; In my opinion, that’s your simplest measure of underlying economic growth and should tell you things are ok. Normalization is not the same as weakness.

&gt; # Sentiment Swings Higher Despite Declines

&gt; Equities have rolled over in the past week with selling hitting a pinnacle when the US government's credit rating was downgraded by Fitch on Wednesday. In spite of this, sentiment has not taken a hit. The latest survey from the AAII showed 49% of respondents reported bullish sentiment which compares to 44.9% the prior week. With nearly half of respondents reporting as optimists, bullish sentiment sits handily above its historical average of 37.5%. In fact, this week marked the ninth in a row with a bullish sentiment reading above the historical average for the longest such streak since one that ended at 13 weeks long in May 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment resulted in bearish sentiment to drop down to 21.3% which marks a 2.8 percentage point decline on the week and resulted in the lowest bearish reading since June 10, 2021 when it was 20.7%. Similar to bullish sentiment, that is the ninth week in a row with a reading below its historical average, and that is the longest streak since July 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; As a result to the increased optimism, the bull-bear spread ticked up from 20.8 last week to 27.7. That is still below the recent high of 29.9 from two weeks ago, but reiterates how investors have an elevated degree of optimism.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; Not all of the gains to bulls came from bears. Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling from 31% to 29.7%. That is in the middle of the past few years' range.

&gt; # Small Dent to Claims

&gt; Initial jobless claims have been trending lower over the past couple of months, reaching a nearly six month low of 221K last week. This week, claims rebounded rising 6K to 227K. Albeit off the strongest readings from last fall, that remains a healthy reading on joblessness.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims are at historically solid levels even if they have come off their best levels. This week, claims dropped to 205K. That is slightly above the readings from the comparable weeks of the year of the past few years (excluding 2020 and 2021 when claims were much more elevated).

&gt; At this point of the year, claims falling is normal as shown in the second chart below. The current week of the year has only seen claims rise week over week 10.7% of the time. That is the sixth most consistent week of declines of the year. Claims will continue to face seasonal tailwinds in the weeks ahead, but that will begin to reverse as summer turns to fall.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims also ticked higher in the latest week's data, reaching 1.7 million. Although higher than 1.69 million the previous week, continuing claims have much more consistently been trending lower recently, and this week's reading did in fact come in below forecasts of 1.705 million.

&gt; # Downgrades Overlooked

&gt; The bottom has dropped out for the major US indices today with the Nasdaq down over 2% and S&amp;P 500 down 1.25% as of this writing. The catalyst has been the downgrade of the United States' credit rating by Fitch from AAA to AA+ . That is the first downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt in almost twelve years and just the second ever. In the charts below, we show the performance of the S&amp;P 500, government debt, commodities, and the US dollar in the year before and the year after the 2011 downgrade.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been rallying in the months leading up to this downgrade, however, back in 2011 the S&amp;P 500 had already begun rolling over by the time S&amp;P downgraded US debt. In the wake of that downgrade, the S&amp;P 500 went on to fully erase all of the prior year's gains. Fortunately, all of those losses were quickly recouped within three months of the downgrade.

&gt; As for Treasuries and other US agency debt, performance over the past few months has been the complete opposite of 2011. Of course, the interest rate environment is also completely different now with Fed Funds 500 bps higher than it was at the time of the last downgrade. That being said, in 2011, Treasury yields were on the decline in the months headed into the downgrade, but contrary to what might have been expected, the downgrade itself did not change that trend. This time around has seen yields on US government debt moving in the opposite direction.

&gt; Bloomberg's broad commodity index has been in a similar boat with the past few months seeing a decline compared to the steady uptrend back in 2011 that was uninterrupted by the downgrade.

&gt; Finally, we would note the downgrade only acted as a longer-term turning point for the dollar. As shown in the bottom right hand chart, both this year and in 2011, the trade weighted dollar was in a downtrend in the year before the downgrade. But right as S&amp;P changed its rating, the dollar turned higher and continued to rise throughout the following year. In fact, one year out it had erased the entirety of the previous year's decline.

&gt; # Stocks Don’t Like August, Now What?

&gt; “Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.” President Dwight D. Eisenhower

&gt; Another month and more strong gains. Make that five months in a row, the S&amp;P 500 finished higher. The S&amp;P 500 is now up close to 20% on the year, just like everyone predicted.

&gt; We came into the year overweight stocks and remain there, so this run has been a lot of fun for us. But honestly, while we’ve been bullish, even we’ve been surprised by how strong markets have been.

&gt; So let’s get the bad news out of the way. The odds are increasing that stocks could finally take some type of a break. Seasonality has worked out perfectly this year. Here’s a chart we shared many, many times, and it said that some of the very best quarters out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle were the three now just behind us. Sure enough, the fourth quarter last year and the first two quarters this year were spectacular for stocks, just like history suggested. Now seasonality is saying to be open to some type of weakness, or at least a break.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-1.gif.png))**

&gt; To be clear, we do not expect major weakness. But we believe a modest pullback of approximately 5% would be perfectly normal. The S&amp;P 500 has closed higher for five consecutive months. And we’re now moving into the austere month of August. August has been a poor performer, ranking worse than only February and September since 1950 and trailing behind only September and December in the last ten years, although still averaging a positive return over both periods. Oh, and right behind August comes September, the weakest month seasonally. So, while the calendar was a tailwind, we believe it is now becoming a near-term headwind.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-2-copy.png))**

&gt; Taking another look at August, when stocks are up more than 17.5% for the year heading into this month, a breather is even more likely. We found 11 previous years (since 1950), this occurred, and August was higher only three times and down 1.1% on average. So the better the year, the worse August does, apparently.

&gt; One of the reasons we were on record for a surprise summer rally was how stocks tended to do when they had a big first month of the year. When the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 5% in January a summer rally tended to occur (check). But we take seasonal warnings as seriously as seasonal support, and now we are in a period of potential seasonal weakness, at least for the near term.

&gt; If stocks experience weakness over the coming months, investors may be surprised and even start projecting the catastrophe many had expected earlier in the year. But keep in mind a pullback in the next couple of months would be entirely normal seasonal behavior. In fact, it may present buying opportunities, or it may simply be a chance to stay the course and remind ourselves that most years see more than three separate 5% pullbacks. Even in a strong year, there will often be bouts of volatility, so we should be ready for it and avoid overreacting. As President Eisenhower said, start planning today.

&gt; Lastly, the S&amp;P 500 closed up five consecutive months yesterday. Historically, stocks have done quite well after similar streaks. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has been up a year later, 26 out of the past 28 times. However, the last time this happened was in June 2021, and that was followed by a drop of nearly 12%. Despite this recent example, the market’s historical strength is likely another indication of higher stock prices in the future.

&gt; All in all, the odds are increasing that stocks could see some seasonal weakness, but we don’t think it will be anything major. In fact, maybe a little breather could be just what the bulls need for an eventual strong end-of-year rally.

&gt; # $10 Trillion Added in Market Cap; 2023's Best and Worst Through July

&gt; The US stock market (using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy) has now seen an increase in market cap of roughly $10 trillion from its bear market low last October through the end of July 2023. As shown below, the peak market cap for the US stock market was $51.5 trillion seen on the first day of 2022. From high to low, total US market cap fell $13.7 trillion during last year's bear, but since then it has risen back up to $47.7 trillion. To get back to new all-time highs, we currently need market cap to rise by roughly $3.8 trillion.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/r3k.png))**

&gt; The average Russell 3,000 stock rose 5.74% in July. There were 813 stocks in the index that rose 10%+ in July, including 29 names that rose 50%+. Below is a table of these 50%+ gainers. Four names rose 100%: PolyMet Mining (PLM), Quantum-Si (QSI), UroGen Pharma (URGN), and Bridgebio Pharma (BBIO). Other notable names on the list of big July winners include Nikola (NKLA), Upstart (UPST), Carvana (CVNA), QuantumScape (QS), Rivian (RIVN), and Riot (RIOT). This list is made up of many of the high-fliers during the post-COVID bull that then got slaughtered during last year's bear.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/rayjuly.png))**

&gt; Through July, the average Russell 3,000 stock was up 18.1% year-to-date. Below is a list of the 35 names that are already up 200%+ on the year. Topping the list is Carvana (CVNA) with a YTD gain of 869% after gaining 77.3% in July. Back in December 2022, CVNA had fallen into the $4s, but it's now back up to the mid-$40s. Next up is Bit Digital (BTBT) with a YTD gain of 638%, followed by Cipher Mining (CIFR), IonQ (IONQ), Riot (RIOT), and Applied Digital (APLD). Similar to the list of July's biggest winners, the biggest winners YTD are many of the names that got hit the hardest last year, with many falling more than 70% during their bear market drawdowns. Carvana, for example, was actually down 98% from its all-time high when it bottomed in 2022, so even after gaining more than 800% this year, it needs to gain another 700% from here to get back to new highs.

&gt; # Key ETF Performance Through July 2023

&gt; The S&amp;P 500-tracking ETF (SPY) finished July up 3.27%, leaving it up 20.62% YTD on a total return basis. The mega-cap Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) gained only slightly more than SPY in July, but it's up more than twice as much as SPY on a YTD basis at +44.5%. The small-cap Russell 2,000 (IWM) did better than large-caps and mid-caps in July with a gain of 6.11%, but IWM is up less than large-caps on a YTD basis at +14.7%. Value and dividend stocks held up well in July and actually outperformed growth for the month, but value is lagging YTD and the DJ Dividend ETF (DVY) is actually down 0.5% on the year.

&gt; Looking at US sectors, Energy (XLE) and Financials (XLF) -- which lagged in the first half of 2023 -- did the best in July, while Health Care (XLV) and Real Estate (XLRE) were up the least. Technology (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) are currently neck and neck on a YTD basis with XLK up 43.94% through July and XLC up just three basis points more at 43.97%.

&gt; Outside of the US, we saw China (ASHR) and Israel (EIS) gain the most in July, while France (EWQ) and Spain (EWP) gained the least. YTD, it's Mexico (EWW) that's currently atop the list of country ETFs with a gain of 42.85%.

&gt; Oil (USO) gained 15%+ in July, while natural gas (UNG) fell 4.2%. Gold (GLD) saw a small monthly gain of 2.3% versus a gain of 8.6% for silver (SLV). Finally, with yields rising again during the month, Treasury ETFs were in the red. Aside from natural gas, the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) is down more than any other asset class in our matrix on a YoY basis with a total return of -12.3%.

&gt; # Dogs of the Dow for the Dog Days of Summer

&gt; With the Dow coming off of a historic winning streak last week, below we check in on performance of the index versus the Dogs of the Dow. The Dogs of a Dow is a stock-picking strategy that invests in the index members with the highest dividend yields at the end of a year holds them through the end of the next year. On a total return basis, the Dow's recent winning streak has been a benefit to both the overall index and the Dogs alike. That said, the gains to the former have brought the index up near 2022 highs on a total return basis while the Dogs of the Dow has much further to go given the overall weakness of dividend-oriented equities recently.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/073123-d1.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we show the returns of this year's Dogs of the Dow and all other individual Dow members. The Dogs of the Dow are host to some of the stocks with the worst performance this year like Verizon (VZ) and Chevron (CVX), however, there are also a couple of big winners like Intel (INTC) which has returned nearly 42% YTD or JPMorgan Chase (JPM) which has nearly posted a 20% return. However, the biggest gains in the index have come from non-Dogs. In fact, the largest gains this year have been from those with the lowest or no dividend yields at the end of last year like Boeing (BA), Salesforce (CRM), or Apple (AAPL).

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and an awesome trading week ahead r/stocks. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Friday evening to all of you here on &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt;! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 7th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq tumble for four straight days, notch worst weeks since March: Live updates - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/03/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slumped Friday for a fourth straight session, and notched their worst weeks since March, as traders seemed to book profits following the latest corporate earnings releases and U.S. jobs data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 shed 0.53% to finish at 4,478.03, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.36% to settle at 13,909.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 150.27 points, or 0.43%, to end at 35,065.62.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the major indexes reversed earlier gains during afternoon trading, and finished the week with losses. The Nasdaq and S&amp;amp;P dropped about 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively, to notch their worst weeks since March. The Dow edged down 1.1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People this week seem more respectful of risk than they were before,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, adding that “lots of bears have been capitulating, which is often a sign that we’re closer to the end of a rally than the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being lower on the day, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) rose to trade above 16 — pointing to investors adding volatility protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday marked the final day of what’s been the busiest week of second-quarter earnings season. Amazon jumped 8.3% to its highest level in nearly a year after trouncing expectations on profit and offering positive guidance. Apple lost 4.8% after reporting lower revenue than the year-ago quarter. Both tech giants reported results late Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sign of the boom in travel and services demand, Booking Holdings gained 7.9% on stronger-than-expected results. Amgen popped 5.5% on solid earnings and a boosted guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings reports this season for the quarter ended in June have continued to surprise some Wall Street analysts as the expected slowdown in profits proves less than feared. About 84% of S&amp;amp;P 500 companies have given results, with 80% surpassing Wall Street expectations, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10-year Treasury yield also pulled back from a multimonth high to 4.04%. Its rise in recent sessions had pressured risk assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;A cooler jobs report&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors also received more clues into the state of the labor market with Friday’s payrolls report. The data showed 187,000 jobs added in July, less than the 200,000 expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. The unemployment rate also ticked lower to 3.5% from 3.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the cooler headline numbers, average hourly wages pointed toward more inflation and came in ahead of expectations, rising 0.4% for the month, and 4.4% on an annualized basis. That came in slightly ahead of the 0.3% and 4.2% expected, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many on Wall Street had been eagerly awaiting the jobs report and its implications for the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking cycle. About 88% of traders expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its next meeting in September, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But next week’s consumer price report for July could make an even greater impact on rate expectations, said Wells Fargo’s Christopher Harvey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A hotter-than-expected print is one of the few things that could really start to change the market’s perception of the Fed, and maybe the Fed’s perception as well,” he said. “But today’s job number, I don’t think does much of anything. I think it solidifies people’s view that the Fed is done at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Economy is Normalizing, and That’s a Good Thing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economy created 187,000 jobs in July, slightly softer than the 200,000 that economists expected. The last couple of months were revised lower, and so it’s always helpful to take a 3-month average, which is now running at 218,000. That’s stronger than the pre-pandemic average of 183,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, job growth remains strong. You will hear some people heralding this as the onset of a recession, but more likely this is just normalization of the economy rather than weakness. The report aligns with what we wrote in our Mid-Year 2023 Outlook, not to mention the title: “Edging Closer to Normal”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-payrolls-601x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector created 172,000 jobs in July, up from 128,000 in June. On a sector level, job growth this year has been driven by non-cyclical areas like health care, education, and government. These sectors had lagged in the early recovery, accounting for just 13% of jobs created in 2021, and 25% in 2022. Over the first 7 months of this year, they’ve accounted for more than 50% of jobs created. July didn’t buck that trend, with health care seeing 100,000 jobs created. Government jobs were on the softer side, rising 15,000 in July versus an average of 53,000 between April and June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cyclical areas of the economy, especially construction, manufacturing, and leisure and hospitality, remain on the softer side, with job growth adding up to 34,000 across these three sectors. So far this year, these sectors have accounted for about 20% of job creation (not exactly “weak”), versus 36% in 2022 and 43% in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the theme is normalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Labor Market Since the Late 1990s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, not far from 50+ year lows of 3.4%. What is amazing is that the unemployment rate is slightly below where it was in June 2023, when the Fed really started to get aggressive with rate hikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate can be impacted by people leaving the labor force (technically defined as those “not looking for work”) and an aging population. I’ve discussed in prior blogs how we can get around this by looking at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e. workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population. Think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you also get around the demographic issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio remained at 80.9%. That is higher than at any point since May 2001. It was actually falling at that time, and didn’t recover until now. This is the best indication that the labor market remains very healthy, and probably in the best shape since the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-employment-population-ratio-612x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line: All Signs Point to a Strong Economy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US economy runs on consumption, and for that you need income. The good news is that income growth appears to remain strong and looks to be running ahead of inflation. In fact, wage growth rose 0.4% in July. Monthly numbers can be volatile, but the 3-month annualized pace is 4.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You combine strong wage growth with strong employment, and that translates to strong income gains across the entire economy. Over the last 3 months, overall income growth for all workers is running at a 5.3% annual pace. Meanwhile, headline inflation is running close to 2.0%. The difference between the two tells you how fast incomes are growing after adjusting for inflation, and that’s running above a 3% annual pace over the past 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-real-income-growth-584x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, that’s your simplest measure of underlying economic growth and should tell you things are ok. Normalization is not the same as weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sentiment Swings Higher Despite Declines&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equities have rolled over in the past week with selling hitting a pinnacle when the US government&amp;#39;s credit rating was downgraded by Fitch on Wednesday. In spite of this, sentiment has not taken a hit. The latest survey from the AAII showed 49% of respondents reported bullish sentiment which compares to 44.9% the prior week. With nearly half of respondents reporting as optimists, bullish sentiment sits handily above its historical average of 37.5%. In fact, this week marked the ninth in a row with a bullish sentiment reading above the historical average for the longest such streak since one that ended at 13 weeks long in May 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-1.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increase in bullish sentiment resulted in bearish sentiment to drop down to 21.3% which marks a 2.8 percentage point decline on the week and resulted in the lowest bearish reading since June 10, 2021 when it was 20.7%. Similar to bullish sentiment, that is the ninth week in a row with a reading below its historical average, and that is the longest streak since July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result to the increased optimism, the bull-bear spread ticked up from 20.8 last week to 27.7. That is still below the recent high of 29.9 from two weeks ago, but reiterates how investors have an elevated degree of optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all of the gains to bulls came from bears. Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling from 31% to 29.7%. That is in the middle of the past few years&amp;#39; range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Small Dent to Claims&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial jobless claims have been trending lower over the past couple of months, reaching a nearly six month low of 221K last week. This week, claims rebounded rising 6K to 227K. Albeit off the strongest readings from last fall, that remains a healthy reading on joblessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-Claims-1.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims are at historically solid levels even if they have come off their best levels. This week, claims dropped to 205K. That is slightly above the readings from the comparable weeks of the year of the past few years (excluding 2020 and 2021 when claims were much more elevated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point of the year, claims falling is normal as shown in the second chart below. The current week of the year has only seen claims rise week over week 10.7% of the time. That is the sixth most consistent week of declines of the year. Claims will continue to face seasonal tailwinds in the weeks ahead, but that will begin to reverse as summer turns to fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing claims also ticked higher in the latest week&amp;#39;s data, reaching 1.7 million. Although higher than 1.69 million the previous week, continuing claims have much more consistently been trending lower recently, and this week&amp;#39;s reading did in fact come in below forecasts of 1.705 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Downgrades Overlooked&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom has dropped out for the major US indices today with the Nasdaq down over 2% and S&amp;amp;P 500 down 1.25% as of this writing. The catalyst has been the downgrade of the United States&amp;#39; credit rating by Fitch from AAA to AA+ . That is the first downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt in almost twelve years and just the second ever. In the charts below, we show the performance of the S&amp;amp;P 500, government debt, commodities, and the US dollar in the year before and the year after the 2011 downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 has been rallying in the months leading up to this downgrade, however, back in 2011 the S&amp;amp;P 500 had already begun rolling over by the time S&amp;amp;P downgraded US debt. In the wake of that downgrade, the S&amp;amp;P 500 went on to fully erase all of the prior year&amp;#39;s gains. Fortunately, all of those losses were quickly recouped within three months of the downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Treasuries and other US agency debt, performance over the past few months has been the complete opposite of 2011. Of course, the interest rate environment is also completely different now with Fed Funds 500 bps higher than it was at the time of the last downgrade. That being said, in 2011, Treasury yields were on the decline in the months headed into the downgrade, but contrary to what might have been expected, the downgrade itself did not change that trend. This time around has seen yields on US government debt moving in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg&amp;#39;s broad commodity index has been in a similar boat with the past few months seeing a decline compared to the steady uptrend back in 2011 that was uninterrupted by the downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would note the downgrade only acted as a longer-term turning point for the dollar. As shown in the bottom right hand chart, both this year and in 2011, the trade weighted dollar was in a downtrend in the year before the downgrade. But right as S&amp;amp;P changed its rating, the dollar turned higher and continued to rise throughout the following year. In fact, one year out it had erased the entirety of the previous year&amp;#39;s decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Stocks Don’t Like August, Now What?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.” President Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another month and more strong gains. Make that five months in a row, the S&amp;amp;P 500 finished higher. The S&amp;amp;P 500 is now up close to 20% on the year, just like everyone predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came into the year overweight stocks and remain there, so this run has been a lot of fun for us. But honestly, while we’ve been bullish, even we’ve been surprised by how strong markets have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s get the bad news out of the way. The odds are increasing that stocks could finally take some type of a break. Seasonality has worked out perfectly this year. Here’s a chart we shared many, many times, and it said that some of the very best quarters out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle were the three now just behind us. Sure enough, the fourth quarter last year and the first two quarters this year were spectacular for stocks, just like history suggested. Now seasonality is saying to be open to some type of weakness, or at least a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-1.gif.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, we do not expect major weakness. But we believe a modest pullback of approximately 5% would be perfectly normal. The S&amp;amp;P 500 has closed higher for five consecutive months. And we’re now moving into the austere month of August. August has been a poor performer, ranking worse than only February and September since 1950 and trailing behind only September and December in the last ten years, although still averaging a positive return over both periods. Oh, and right behind August comes September, the weakest month seasonally. So, while the calendar was a tailwind, we believe it is now becoming a near-term headwind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-2-copy.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking another look at August, when stocks are up more than 17.5% for the year heading into this month, a breather is even more likely. We found 11 previous years (since 1950), this occurred, and August was higher only three times and down 1.1% on average. So the better the year, the worse August does, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons we were on record for a surprise summer rally was how stocks tended to do when they had a big first month of the year. When the S&amp;amp;P 500 gained more than 5% in January a summer rally tended to occur (check). But we take seasonal warnings as seriously as seasonal support, and now we are in a period of potential seasonal weakness, at least for the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-3-copy.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If stocks experience weakness over the coming months, investors may be surprised and even start projecting the catastrophe many had expected earlier in the year. But keep in mind a pullback in the next couple of months would be entirely normal seasonal behavior. In fact, it may present buying opportunities, or it may simply be a chance to stay the course and remind ourselves that most years see more than three separate 5% pullbacks. Even in a strong year, there will often be bouts of volatility, so we should be ready for it and avoid overreacting. As President Eisenhower said, start planning today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the S&amp;amp;P 500 closed up five consecutive months yesterday. Historically, stocks have done quite well after similar streaks. In fact, the S&amp;amp;P 500 has been up a year later, 26 out of the past 28 times. However, the last time this happened was in June 2021, and that was followed by a drop of nearly 12%. Despite this recent example, the market’s historical strength is likely another indication of higher stock prices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the odds are increasing that stocks could see some seasonal weakness, but we don’t think it will be anything major. In fact, maybe a little breather could be just what the bulls need for an eventual strong end-of-year rally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;$10 Trillion Added in Market Cap; 2023&amp;#39;s Best and Worst Through July&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US stock market (using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy) has now seen an increase in market cap of roughly $10 trillion from its bear market low last October through the end of July 2023. As shown below, the peak market cap for the US stock market was $51.5 trillion seen on the first day of 2022. From high to low, total US market cap fell $13.7 trillion during last year&amp;#39;s bear, but since then it has risen back up to $47.7 trillion. To get back to new all-time highs, we currently need market cap to rise by roughly $3.8 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average Russell 3,000 stock rose 5.74% in July. There were 813 stocks in the index that rose 10%+ in July, including 29 names that rose 50%+. Below is a table of these 50%+ gainers. Four names rose 100%: PolyMet Mining (PLM), Quantum-Si (QSI), UroGen Pharma (URGN), and Bridgebio Pharma (BBIO). Other notable names on the list of big July winners include Nikola (NKLA), Upstart (UPST), Carvana (CVNA), QuantumScape (QS), Rivian (RIVN), and Riot (RIOT). This list is made up of many of the high-fliers during the post-COVID bull that then got slaughtered during last year&amp;#39;s bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through July, the average Russell 3,000 stock was up 18.1% year-to-date. Below is a list of the 35 names that are already up 200%+ on the year. Topping the list is Carvana (CVNA) with a YTD gain of 869% after gaining 77.3% in July. Back in December 2022, CVNA had fallen into the $4s, but it&amp;#39;s now back up to the mid-$40s. Next up is Bit Digital (BTBT) with a YTD gain of 638%, followed by Cipher Mining (CIFR), IonQ (IONQ), Riot (RIOT), and Applied Digital (APLD). Similar to the list of July&amp;#39;s biggest winners, the biggest winners YTD are many of the names that got hit the hardest last year, with many falling more than 70% during their bear market drawdowns. Carvana, for example, was actually down 98% from its all-time high when it bottomed in 2022, so even after gaining more than 800% this year, it needs to gain another 700% from here to get back to new highs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Key ETF Performance Through July 2023&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500-tracking ETF (SPY) finished July up 3.27%, leaving it up 20.62% YTD on a total return basis. The mega-cap Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) gained only slightly more than SPY in July, but it&amp;#39;s up more than twice as much as SPY on a YTD basis at +44.5%. The small-cap Russell 2,000 (IWM) did better than large-caps and mid-caps in July with a gain of 6.11%, but IWM is up less than large-caps on a YTD basis at +14.7%. Value and dividend stocks held up well in July and actually outperformed growth for the month, but value is lagging YTD and the DJ Dividend ETF (DVY) is actually down 0.5% on the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at US sectors, Energy (XLE) and Financials (XLF) -- which lagged in the first half of 2023 -- did the best in July, while Health Care (XLV) and Real Estate (XLRE) were up the least. Technology (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) are currently neck and neck on a YTD basis with XLK up 43.94% through July and XLC up just three basis points more at 43.97%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the US, we saw China (ASHR) and Israel (EIS) gain the most in July, while France (EWQ) and Spain (EWP) gained the least. YTD, it&amp;#39;s Mexico (EWW) that&amp;#39;s currently atop the list of country ETFs with a gain of 42.85%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil (USO) gained 15%+ in July, while natural gas (UNG) fell 4.2%. Gold (GLD) saw a small monthly gain of 2.3% versus a gain of 8.6% for silver (SLV). Finally, with yields rising again during the month, Treasury ETFs were in the red. Aside from natural gas, the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) is down more than any other asset class in our matrix on a YoY basis with a total return of -12.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dogs of the Dow for the Dog Days of Summer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Dow coming off of a historic winning streak last week, below we check in on performance of the index versus the Dogs of the Dow. The Dogs of a Dow is a stock-picking strategy that invests in the index members with the highest dividend yields at the end of a year holds them through the end of the next year. On a total return basis, the Dow&amp;#39;s recent winning streak has been a benefit to both the overall index and the Dogs alike. That said, the gains to the former have brought the index up near 2022 highs on a total return basis while the Dogs of the Dow has much further to go given the overall weakness of dividend-oriented equities recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the table below, we show the returns of this year&amp;#39;s Dogs of the Dow and all other individual Dow members. The Dogs of the Dow are host to some of the stocks with the worst performance this year like Verizon (VZ) and Chevron (CVX), however, there are also a couple of big winners like Intel (INTC) which has returned nearly 42% YTD or JPMorgan Chase (JPM) which has nearly posted a 20% return. However, the biggest gains in the index have come from non-Dogs. In fact, the largest gains this year have been from those with the lowest or no dividend yields at the end of last year like Boeing (BA), Salesforce (CRM), or Apple (AAPL).&lt;/p&gt;

# Earnings and Revenue YoY Decline

With 84% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (and 80% of the market cap roughly) having reported, the new blended earnings estimate is -5.2% YoY--one week ago, their estimate was -7.4%, so we surprised to the upside. The blended revenue estimate is +0.6% YoY. [Blended just means combine estimates of companies that haven't reported with those that have]

# Beating/Missing Earnings

&gt; Of these companies, 79% have reported actual EPS above estimates, which is above the 5-year average of 77% and above the 10-year average of 73%. [...]

&gt; In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 7.2% above estimates, which is below the 5-year average of 8.4% but above the 10-year average of 6.4%.

So 80% are beating (on average 73% do), and they are beating estimates by 7.2% on average (which is typical). Yes, analysts lowered estimates.

# Sectoral Breakdown

The year over year declines in earnings are driven entirely by 3 sectors: Energy, Materials, and Health Care. All other sectors are seeing year over year growth. Similarly, the revenue declines are only in 3 sectors: utilities, energy, materials. Notice health care missing? In fact, the top 3 sectors by revenue growth are consumer discretionary, financials, and health care. My conclusion is that healthcare's earnings decline is driven by steep margin compression. [Patents expiring? Post-Covid operations increasing costs for insurers?] While energy/materials are just seeing revenue tank and thus earnings.

Top 3 earnings sectors are Consumer discretionary, Communication Services, Industrials. Guessing thanks to AMZN, META, GOOG, CAT.

Hedge funds have lost more than $6bn this year betting against cruise lines and hotels after underestimating the resilience of US consumers. Cruise lines Royal Caribbean and Carnival are two of the 10 most heavily shorted companies in the S&amp;P 500 but have confounded short sellers’ expectations by more than doubling in value so far this year. Short sellers — typically hedge funds — aim to make money by selling borrowed stock and buying it back at a lower price when the shares decline.

Carnival, Royal Caribbean and smaller rival Norwegian accounted for $2.9bn of the losses. Large short positions in Airbnb, which has rallied 70 per cent year to date, and Booking.com, which is up 44 per cent, have also inflicted big losses.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This ETF aims to outperform major US equity indices during market upswings by utilizing derivatives and minimize losses through investments in cash or cash equivalents during downward trends.  
&gt;  
&gt;When the Fund is allocated to U.S. equity securities, it will have approximately the following daily exposures: 80% to the S&amp;P 500®, 80% to QQQ, and up to 40% to the Sector Allocation. The Fund will utilize leverage to achieve total exposure of up to 200% of the Fund’s net assets to these allocations. A Sector Allocation of less than 40% may result in the Fund having less than 200% total exposure each day. 

  
The fund seems to have a proprietary, quantitative investment model that attempts to minimize loss and maximize gains across all market conditions.  
Given the ETF's complex structure, including 80% exposure to S&amp;P 500 Index, 80% exposure to the largest non-financial U.S. companies on NASDAQ, daily rebalancing, and up to 200% leverage, I'm curious to hear your thoughts.  


1. Has anyone heard of or invested in this new ETF?  

2. What are your thoughts on the tactical management approach described?  

3. Does anyone have experience with such actively managed, leveraged products, and could shed some light on how it works in practice?

  
Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated as I'm trying to understand this new investment vehicle better. Thanks in advance!

Job growth in July was less than expected, pointing to slower growth in the U.S. economy, the Labor Department reported Friday.

Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 187,000 for the month, slightly below the Dow Jones estimate for 200,000. Though the headline number was a miss, it actually represented a modest gain from the downwardly revised 185,000 in for June.

The unemployment rate was 3.5%, against a consensus estimate that the jobless level would hold steady at 3.6%.The rate is just above the lowest level since late 1969.

Average hourly earnings, a key figure as the Federal Reserve fights inflation, rose 0.4% for the month, good for a 4.4% annual pace. Both numbers were higher than the respective estimates for 0.3% and 4.2%.

Another important figure, the labor force participation rate held at 62.6%, the fifth straight month at that level. A more encompassing unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons fell to 6.7%, down 0.2 percentage point from June. The survey of households, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed a more robust gain of 268,000.

Health care led job creation by industry, adding 63,000 jobs for the month. Other sectors contributing included social assistance (24,000), financial activities (19,000) and wholesale trade (18,000). The other services category contributed 20,000 to the total, which included 11,000 from personal and laundry services.

Leisure and hospitality, which has been a leading sector for most of the recovery in the Covid pandemic era, added just 17,000 jobs, consistent with a slowing trend after averaging gains of 67,000 a month in the first three months of 2023.

Previous months’ totals were revised lower — the June count dropped to185,000, a downward revision of 24,000, while May was cut to 281,000, down 25,000 from the previous estimate.

Even with the slowing job gains, the economy has proved resilient against a variety of challenges, particularly a series of 11 Federal Reserve interest rate hikes aimed at bringing down inflation.

Most Wall Street experts have been forecasting a recession at least for the past year, but growth has managed to stay positive as consumers keep spending and the services sector rebounds from its pandemic-related disruptions.

Gross domestic product gains have averaged 2.2% annualized for the first half of 2023, and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker of growth is pointing to a 3.9% gain for the third quarter.

However, Fed officials including Chairman Jerome Powell have warned that the full effect of the rate increases has not been felt yet. Economists worry that the Fed could over-tighten and send the economy into recession.

Inflation data of late has been moving in the right direction. However, the Fed’s preferred gauge is still showing prices rising at a 4.1% annual rate, or more than double the central bank target.

Wages have been one component of the inflation picture. Average hourly earnings had been declining, though the annual figures are somewhat distorted by comparisons to a year ago when wages were surging.

A Labor Department gauge that the Fed follows closely showed compensation costs rising at a 4.5% 12-month rate through the second quarter. That level is not consistent with the Fed’s inflation target.

At the same time, recession fears on Wall Street appear to be ebbing.

-----------------

**Sales**

Last time I lowered my bear case for 2023 to 1.7M, with 2.15M sales expected and 2.4M in the bull case. With 889K cars sold in H1 and the announced retooling for the Model 3 refresh, I expect them to comfortably exceed my bear case, but believe the bull case needs to lowered to 2.2M for an expected amount of sales of 1.95M for the full year. With the slightly slower ramp in Texas and Berlin, the slower than expected rollout of the Cybertruck and Mexico only coming online by the end of 2024 at the earliest, I will also lower the bull cases for 2024 and 2025 from 3.4M and 4.8M respectively:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|1,800,000|2,200,000|
|**2024**|2,400,000|3,000,000|
|**2025**|3,000,000|4,400,000|

**ASP**

I expected Tesla to decrease ASPs from $54,385 to ~$51K in 2023. With ASPs of $46,379 in H1, and although I expect ASPs to be higher in H2, I will also lower my expectations here to $47K.

I then expect ASPs to increase to $49K in 2024 and then start to decline with the introduction of the compact car, starting with $48K in 2025.

**Revenue**

Based on the ASPs and delivery numbers, the new expected automotive revenues would come down to:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|$85B|$103B|
|**2024**|$118B|$144B|
|**2025**|$144B|$211B|

As for non-automotive revenue, I will leave my expectations unchanged:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|$16B|$24B|
|**2024**|$22B|$40B|
|**2025**|$30B|$60B|

**Operating Margin**

Despite IRA battery credits (starting in March), cheaper commodity prices, increasing economies of scale (especially in Berlin and Texas), operating margin came out significantly lower than I expected at ~10.5%. I will therefor lower my margin expectations for both the bear and bull cases.

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|8%|13%|
|**2024**|10%|16%|
|**2025**|12%|20%|

**Net Income**

Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|$8.1B|$16.5B|
|**2024**|$14.0B|$29.4B|
|**2025**|$20.9B|$54.2B|

**P/E**

After the incredible gains this year so far, the current $822B market cap divided by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|101|50|
|**2024**|59|28|
|**2025**|39|15|

**PEG**

This would translate into the following PEG ratings:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|N/A|1.61|
|**2024**|0.72|0.36|
|**2025**|0.79|0.18|

------------------------------

**The conclusion**

It was obvious to anyone able to do a basic financial analysis that Tesla was oversold at $108, but I heavily underestimated the effects rising interest rates would have on Tesla's ASPs and by extension margins. While Tesla looks set to easily maintain their target growth of 50% on annual unit sales, their revenues will grow at a lower pace and net income will even be largely flat this year before resuming growth.

Despite all that and the increase in stock price since my last analysis, the PE and PEG ratios show Tesla is still undervalued in the long term. Assuming growth would flatten to ~30% after 2025, Tesla would still need to grow at least 2x for the valuation to be in line with other big tech companies. That said, the opportunity has come down a very large amount since my last evaluation and although I disagree, there is now a reasonable argument to be made that Tesla is no longer a no-brainer investment that every long term investor should have in their portfolio.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past I&amp;#39;ve made multiple posts on Tesla&amp;#39;s valuation (&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10sk1gh/on_teslas_valuation_part_4/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time I lowered my bear case for 2023 to 1.7M, with 2.15M sales expected and 2.4M in the bull case. With 889K cars sold in H1 and the announced retooling for the Model 3 refresh, I expect them to comfortably exceed my bear case, but believe the bull case needs to lowered to 2.2M for an expected amount of sales of 1.95M for the full year. With the slightly slower ramp in Texas and Berlin, the slower than expected rollout of the Cybertruck and Mexico only coming online by the end of 2024 at the earliest, I will also lower the bull cases for 2024 and 2025 from 3.4M and 4.8M respectively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bear Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bull Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1,800,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2,200,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2,400,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;4,400,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expected Tesla to decrease ASPs from $54,385 to ~$51K in 2023. With ASPs of $46,379 in H1, and although I expect ASPs to be higher in H2, I will also lower my expectations here to $47K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then expect ASPs to increase to $49K in 2024 and then start to decline with the introduction of the compact car, starting with $48K in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the ASPs and delivery numbers, the new expected automotive revenues would come down to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bear Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bull Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$85B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$103B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$118B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$144B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$144B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$211B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for non-automotive revenue, I will leave my expectations unchanged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bear Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bull Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$16B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$24B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$22B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$40B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$30B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$60B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating Margin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite IRA battery credits (starting in March), cheaper commodity prices, increasing economies of scale (especially in Berlin and Texas), operating margin came out significantly lower than I expected at ~10.5%. I will therefor lower my margin expectations for both the bear and bull cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bear Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bull Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net Income&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bear Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bull Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$8.1B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$16.5B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$14.0B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$29.4B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$20.9B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$54.2B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P/E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the incredible gains this year so far, the current $822B market cap divided by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bear Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bull Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;101&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;59&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PEG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would translate into the following PEG ratings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bear Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bull Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;N/A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1.61&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;0.72&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;0.36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;0.79&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;0.18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was obvious to anyone able to do a basic financial analysis that Tesla was oversold at $108, but I heavily underestimated the effects rising interest rates would have on Tesla&amp;#39;s ASPs and by extension margins. While Tesla looks set to easily maintain their target growth of 50% on annual unit sales, their revenues will grow at a lower pace and net income will even be largely flat this year before resuming growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all that and the increase in stock price since my last analysis, the PE and PEG ratios show Tesla is still undervalued in the long term. Assuming growth would flatten to ~30% after 2025, Tesla would still need to grow at least 2x for the valuation to be in line with other big tech companies. That said, the opportunity has come down a very large amount since my last evaluation and although I disagree, there is now a reasonable argument to be made that Tesla is no longer a no-brainer investment that every long term investor should have in their portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Currently, unionized factory workers at the Detroit car companies start at about $18 an hour. The top wage, achieved over a period of years, is about $32 an hour.

The 40% pay hike would be a general increase over the life of the next four-year contract. It would be broken up into a 20% increase upon the contract’s ratification, and four additional 5% wage increases given each year, according to a person familiar with the matter. 

A UAW spokesperson said that during the current contract, the average CEO salary at the Detroit car companies has increased 40%. “We believe UAW members deserve the same if not more.”

UAW President Shawn Fain has already taken an aggressive stance with the automakers, pledging to take a different tack than past UAW leaders and make significant gains for members, particularly on wages and benefits lost in previous rounds of talks.

In a speech to members Tuesday, he vowed to secure double-digit pay increases for members, without specifying an exact percentage.

He also outlined a list of 10 demands that he plans to bring to automakers, including the right to strike over plant closures, the re-establishment of some retiree benefits and a defined pension plan for all workers.

“Yes, we’re demanding double-digit pay raises,” Fain said during the address, which was broadcast via a Facebook livestream event.

Wages are typically a focus during bargaining between the UAW and the car companies, but this year, they have taken on greater prominence, following a period of high inflation. The union is also demanding a return of cost-of-living adjustments and other benefits given up in previous negotiations to help the car companies survive financially.

Still, a 40% pay increase is unusually large, compared with previous contracts. In the last round of talks, which concluded in late 2019, the union secured two sets of 3% increases over the life of the contract, along with lump-sum payments.

The car companies have historically resisted big pay increases, preferring to instead offer workers bonuses and other one-time payments that don’t add to their fixed costs.

Fain, a reform-minded leader elected to lead the 87-year-old union earlier this year, has taken a more militant tone in his dealings with the automakers and has made clear he is willing to strike.

He has argued that all three automakers are coming off a period of robust profits and that it is time for workers to share in the success.

GM said it plans to increase wages for workers, but that the union’s demands as they currently stand would threaten the company’s ability to support its hourly workers long-term.

Ford said it looks forward to working with the UAW, while Stellantis said it had a productive meeting Tuesday with the UAW leader and it is reviewing the union’s demands.

Along with higher wages, the UAW is also seeking greater job security for its members, particularly as the auto industry transitions away from the gasoline vehicles that have long supported factory jobs to building a new generation of electric vehicles.

Some auto executives say battery-powered vehicles require fewer workers to assemble than traditional gas-engine cars, and jobs for those who work at engine and transmission plants are at risk in a future that is more focused on EVs.

Ford, GM and Stellantis have all funneled billions of dollars into building new electric-vehicle plants and battery-making facilities in a collective bet that the technology will attract new customers.

For their part, they want more flexibility from the union to navigate this shift and reassign workers to new areas that support their long-term objectives on EVs.

Hard to talk about ideas here bc imo small caps would provide the best asymmetry if a war doesn’t happen. Companies with mining claims to big deposits could be big winners if there is a war bc it doesn’t matter what happens above ground as long as you don’t get nationalized: the metal stays in the ground unmolested (See Rick Rule and the Friedlands investing in Ivanhoe the copper mining company in the Congo in the middle of a war).

**Background**

Confluent, founded in 2014 by the original creators of Apache Kafka, has become an integral part of the modern data stack.

 Their platform, used across various industries including banking, retail, logistics, manufacturing, and telecommunications, enables businesses to harness the power of stream processing to make data a continually flowing resource.

Companies such as **Credit Suisse, Domino's, and Expedia Group** are among the numerous businesses successfully leveraging Confluent's platform.

Confluent differentiates itself with a cloud-native solution that reimagines Kafka for the cloud. It provides a complete package for developers to build next-generation applications securely.

Moreover, Confluent is designed to be present wherever its customers need it.

Their go-to-market strategy is product-led, which allows customers to get hands-on with the product early on, delivering faster time-to-value.

The model is also consumption-oriented, with customer health and actual usage being primary indicators of success.

**Financial Highlights:**

- Confluent reported a **total revenue** of **$189.3 million**, a **36% YoY increase**.
- The company's **Confluent Cloud revenue** was **$84 million**, a **78% YoY increase**.

393,stocks,"The company’s DTC division reported $410 million in licensing revenue, more than triple last year’s sales, after offering shows like “Westworld” to rivals

Revenue from licensing HBO content buoyed Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming business in the second quarter, the company revealed in its earnings report Thursday. The sales helped significantly narrow its loss and appeared to be playing a big part in the company’s promise for its U.S. direct-t0-consumer business to turn a profit in 2023.

The media giant reported $2.73 billion in revenue in its DTC segment, which launched its Max service during the quarter. That was a 37% leap from last year’s second quarter, and represented about 26% of the company’s total revenue for the period. The segment swung to a $3 million EBITDA loss for the second quarter after reporting $50 million in positive EBITDA in the first quarter.

Content licensing revenue at $410 million revenue rose notably, more than tripling the $132 million reported in the same quarter last year, suggesting that the company would have had a far more significant loss without those fees.

The growth in licensing reflects a surprising move in recent months toward offering HBO shows like “Westworld” to free, ad-supported streaming TV services like Amazon’s Freevee and the Roku Channel. Warner Bros. Discovery also licensed HBO shows including “Insecure” to Netflix.

CEO David Zaslav said on a call with analysts Thursday that it would seek to do deals on a “co-exclusive” basis, meaning the licensed shows would also be available to Max subscribers.

Distribution revenue of $2.19 billion made up the bulk of the division’s total, including traditional HBO subscriptions, Max and HBO Max subscriptions, and Amazon Prime Video Channels revenue. Advertising revenue jumped 26% to $121 million, also mainly driven by subscriber growth. Total DTC subscribers fell by 1.8 million in the quarter to 95.8 million.

Zaslav told analysts the company’s deep content library “offers a wealth of opportunity in terms of feeding our own platforms, as well as others.”

“It’s a mainstay of our business to create great content and window width, through creating value in each window,” he said. “And as you would expect a lot of analysis and strategic discussion goes into these decisions. In some cases, we’ll want to keep premium content exclusively on our platform for a very long time. In other cases, we may sell it to third parties, and we don’t lose anything by growing the pie.”

“The fact is licensing some library content to others VOD platforms like Netflix or Amazon as part of a co-exclusive agreement is just smart business,” Zaslav said. “We’re expanding our audience, while maximizing the value of the asset and providing more revenue streams. And that is our job, to optimize the windowing to get the best possible return on investment.”

Warner Bros Discovery also inked deals with Roku and Tubi to license 2,000 hours of content and launch a series of channels in January. It also plans to introduce its own FAST service this year.

Later in the call, the CEO noted that if the Hollywood strikes continue, “there may be more demand” for WBD content.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s DTC division reported $410 million in licensing revenue, more than triple last year’s sales, after offering shows like “Westworld” to rivals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price for both is similar. I&amp;#39;m willing to wait for my thesis to pan out, so the additional time isn&amp;#39;t a dealbreaker. Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

i'd like to start with 2000CHF and then add more from time to time.

Im from switzerland and use degiro, if that matters.

1st question: i often see people invest a part of their income monthly, wich is my plan. Is it smart to save up that part and invest quarterly to save a bit on fees?

2nd question: I might try trading stocks in the future for more short term profit. Is it good to start with 100CHF, just to see how it turns out?

For my starting portfolio i have following plan:
1000 in VUSA
500 in CHSPI

Get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in business, from Wall Street to Silicon Valley — delivered daily.

The founder of a key Apple supplier warned of disaster on Wall Street should a war break out over Taiwan.

""If a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, it wouldn't take a month or even an hour, but just 10 seconds for the Wall Street stock market to collapse,"" Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou wrote on Facebook on Wednesday, according to an Insider translation. His post appears to have been deleted by Thursday morning, although a cached copy of the post remains.

Gou, the 72-year-old founder of the contract manufacturing giant Foxconn, wrote the post after meeting New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman on the same day.

He said he told Friedman that Taiwan's role in the global economy is far more important than that of Ukraine, which is now embroiled in a war with Russia. China claims self-ruled Taiwan — the world's top chip supplier — as its territory and has been ramping up military drills around the island.

Gou added Taiwan may be able to hold out in a war for three months, but the impact on the world's economy and financial markets would be huge and immediate.

Gou founded Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, in 1974. He is worth nearly $7.2 billion, with a substantial portion of his wealth derived from a 12.6% stake in the publicly traded division of Foxconn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The tycoon's comments about geopolitical tensions over the Taiwan Strait come amid speculation over his political ambitions.

The business magnate stepped down as Foxconn's chairman in 2019 in a bid to run for Taiwan's presidency, but dropped out of the race after he failed to win the nomination of KMT, Taiwan's main opposition party. He tried again this year, but again failed to win the party's nomination.

Some analysts think Gou may still make a run for the island's top job, the South China Morning Post reported on July 18.

Gou did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider sent to his verified Instagram account.

The Taiwan presidential election is scheduled to take place on January 13, 2024.

*****
&gt; Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.
*****
&gt; Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.
*****
&gt; “Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”
*****
&gt; In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.

# [Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”
*****
&gt; A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.
*****
&gt; “I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.
*****
&gt; CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.

&lt;p&gt;“There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.&lt;/p&gt;

419,stocks,"Apple is expected to witness a decline in iPhone sales during the April-June quarter, attributed to cautious consumer behaviour in a slow economy as the launch of a new model is anticipated. As the tech giant prepares to release its earnings report, analysts emphasise the significance of revealing its utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost growth.

Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv.
Specifically, iPhone sales are anticipated to have declined by over 2% during this period, based on a survey of 24 analysts conducted by Visible Alpha. This contrasts with a nearly 3% increase in sales during the same quarter last year and a 1.5% rise in the preceding quarter (January-March).

The upcoming quarterly report may serve as a deviation from the positive earnings trend observed in other prominent tech companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Microsoft. These companies have demonstrated resilience in their cloud-based operations and have witnessed a surge in digital ad sales.
""Apple is not immune to general macroeconomic trends and will continue to set the pace (for the smartphone industry) for quite some time,"" Reuters quoted Bob O'Donnell, founder of TECHnalysis Research, as saying.
In September, analysts anticipate the unveiling of the much-anticipated iPhone 15, which could feature the widely accepted USB-C port on certain models. This development may provide a slight boost to iPhone sales during the July-September quarter, according to market experts, who have differing opinions on the overall performance during this period.

Notably, Apple has a tradition of not providing quarterly outlooks. However, industry analysts speculate that the tech giant might shed light on its utilisation of AI to enhance the upcoming product lineup, offering insights into the company's innovative approach.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is expected to witness a decline in iPhone sales during the April-June quarter, attributed to cautious consumer behaviour in a slow economy as the launch of a new model is anticipated.

Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA on Tuesday, pointing to “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,” as well as a growing general debt burden.

Back in May, the agency placed the nation’s AAA rating on negative watch, blaming the debt ceiling fight. At the time, lawmakers in Washington butted heads over an agreement that would keep the federal government from running out of money. President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill on June 2, just days away from the “X-date” on June 5.

The country’s recent debt limit feud was mentioned again in the downgrade.

“In Fitch’s view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025,” the ratings agency said.

“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” Fitch said.

The agency also highlighted the rising general government deficit, which it anticipates will rise to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. “Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending (15% of total federal spending) as agreed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act offer only a modest improvement to the medium-term fiscal outlook,” Fitch said.

The agency also noted that a combination of tightening credit conditions, weakening business investment and a slowdown in consumption could lead the economy into a “mild” recession in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of next year.

This isn’t the first time a rating agency has downgraded the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2011 after Washington managed to avoid a default. At the time, the agency highlighted political risk as part of its reasoning.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There are some risks involved with investing in BKNG because of their business style. Being a business that focuses on travel, BKNG's success is closely correlated with that of the travel sector.

Since a few years ago, BKNG has made significant investments in AI technology, further demonstrating their dedication to provide consumers with trips that are more connected and personalised. By using AI to analyse information in several languages and provide personalised recommendations, BKNG hopes to improve relationships with customers and partners.   
While other BKNG brands are working to incorporate this technology into their own offers, others, like KAYAK and OpenTable, are actively experimenting with generative AI plug-ins.

I had a few shares of NTDOY recently on a dividend payout with this cost structure info

1 share NTDOY (currently trades $11.28) is 1/4th of Nintendo 7974.T stock  
Dividend declared 123 yen/share or 30.75 yen/NTDOY   
Dividend received in US account on July 11th when yen to dollar was 140.27yen/dollar  
Dividend I received of $0.214 per NTDOY after-foreign taxes withheld and conversion to the dollar  
This means 0.214 was received when the conversion would be 0.219 so approx -3% to taxes  
ADR maintenance fee charged after the dividend of $0.0299 / share meaning $0.1841 received  


Final net of 0.1841/share on estimated 0.219 payout is 84% efficiency or in other words -16% of the dividend payout goes to foreign taxes and also ADR fees before US taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a similar experience seeing about 16% of the yield value go out the door to ADR?  While I like NTDOY, I was curious if NTDOF has a lower fee in the end, was wondering if anyone is holding it and wants to look at it and compare? 

The ADRS trade at the same relative price adjusting for share % but in my view if one has significantly lower fees it would be a better buy.

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street’s busiest earnings week continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.
*****
&gt; Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.
*****
&gt; More than 160 S&amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.
*****
&gt; To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.
*****
&gt; “We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”
*****
&gt; He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.
*****
&gt; “As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.
*****
&gt; Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html""&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broadening of the market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl&amp;#39;s (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (&lt;sup&gt;DJI).&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven&amp;#39;t mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks with Tesla Inc., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and other automakers about supplying them with lithium as the oil giant works to build a business around the crucial battery metal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Exxon is one of several oil and gas companies seeking to expand into lithium production to take advantage of surging demand for use in electric-vehicle batteries, and as a way of diversifying beyond fossil fuels. The talks with potential customers are still early stage, and the company has yet to lay out its plans for potential lithium operations. However, the discussions are the latest sign of Exxon’s growing interest in the lithium business.

The company has also had conversations with battery giants Samsung and SK On Co., the people said, asking not to be named because the information is private. Exxon, SK On and Volkswagen declined to comment. Tesla, Ford and Samsung didn’t reply to messages seeking comment.

The rapid global roll out of electric vehicles has raised the risk of bottlenecks and shortages for key battery materials like lithium, sparking a rush to invest in and secure supply. The world will need nearly 60 new lithium mines and plants to feed the growing demand for the shift away from fossil fuels, according to researcher Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, and more lithium will be required in 2030 than was mined between 2015 and 2022.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/exxon-in-talks-with-tesla-ford-volkswagen-on-supplying-lithium?leadSource=uverify%20wall""&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/exxon-in-talks-with-tesla-ford-volkswagen-on-supplying-lithium?leadSource=uverify%20wall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

More than 1 million Netflix accounts and around 800,000 Disney+ subscribers in the U.S. are on ad-supported tiers, according to Ampere, representing nearly 2% of each service’s total subscriber base. The firm estimates that more than 90% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad-supported tier, representing around 45 million subscriptions.

Prior to the launch of Max, Discovery+ had somewhere in the region of 10 million ad-supported accounts, while HBO Max had around 2 million, Ampere said. It added that Peacock has more than 30 million ad-supported subscribers, the most of any new U.S. OTT service, while Paramount+ has more than 25 million ad-supported subscribers in the U.S.

Ampere believes that hybrid services are “an increasingly important element of streaming service monetization, and hybrid tiers often generate more revenue per subscription than their ad-free counterparts.” It also says that the tiers “represent a way for consumers to maintain a wider array of subscriptions while economic times remain tough.”

Ampere’s latest research comes as earnings season for the major studios is in full swing.

Netflix, which recently eliminated its basic ad-free plan in the United States as it expands its password sharing crackdown, added 5.9 million paid subscribers during the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 238.4 million globally. During its upfront presentation to advertisers in May, Netflix reported that the ad tier had nearly 5 million monthly active users.

Meanwhile, NBCUniversal parent Comcast reported that Peacock had a total of 24 million paid subscribers. The streaming service, which dropped its free tier for new users in January, recently said it would bump up the price for its Premium and Premium Plus tiers to $5.99 and $11.99, respectively, which will take effect on Aug. 17. Due to certain streaming rights and contracts with content providers, some Peacock content still has ads.

Next up on the earnings docket will be Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its Max rebrand on May 23 — which offers a $9.99 per month Max Ad Lite tier, $15.99 per month Max Ad Free tier and $19.99 per month Max Ultimate Ad Free tier.

Meanwhile, Paramount Global, which charges $5.99 per month for its ad-supported option, and Disney, which launched its $7.99 per month ad-supported Disney+ tier in November, will report earnings on Aug. 7 and 9, respectively.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;

459,stocks,"*BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year*

Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 31.07.23, 08:15 AM

Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).

The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.

The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.

At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.

BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.

When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.

In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.

Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.

“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.

**Galloping run**

The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.

”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.

A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).

”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.

In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.

”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.

The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”

**Strategic role**

The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.

Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.

BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.

For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.

Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.

**Tightrope**

Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.

The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.

”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.

Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.

The company released its second-quarter financial results on Thursday. The U.S.-based automaker's EV division, called ""Ford Model e,"" has lost $1.8 billion so far this year, according to Fortune.

The projected $4.5 billion loss is over twice as much as Model e's $2.1 billion loss in 2022. The company recently announced that the price of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks will be reduced due to cheaper raw battery materials.

The company touted that its low EV prices ""establish[es] leadership ahead of industry’s next-generation EVs"" and that the Ford Model e's revenue is up 39%. Ford is also expected to produce 600,000 EVs per year by 2024.

Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by $2.7 billion, up 26% during the second quarter to $12.7 billion at quarterend, and over 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are from direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the second quarter, the median FICO score was 747. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans. Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. SoFi Bank, N.A. generated $63.1 million of GAAP net income at a 17% margin.”

SoFi continues to thrive in this macro environment:

* Galileo, Technisys, and bank charter form the pillars for SoFi to become ""The AWS of Fintech""
* The acquisition of Wyndham Capital on April 3rd completes the three arms of lending under one umbrella. This cut off the middleman fee and maximizes profitability for the most lucrative segment of SoFi's businesses.
* The wide diversity of SoFi business allows it to thrive in any macro environment.
* SoFi's Savings with direct deposit APY of 4.4% gives an extra push for deposit growth in subsequent quarters.
* SoFi Checking and Savings Offers Access to Up to $2 Million in FDIC Insurance ensuring depositors that their money above $250K won't go up in smoke.

More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans. Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. SoFi Bank, N.A. generated $63.1 million of GAAP net income at a 17% margin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SoFi continues to thrive in this macro environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Galileo, Technisys, and bank charter form the pillars for SoFi to become &amp;quot;The AWS of Fintech&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The acquisition of Wyndham Capital on April 3rd completes the three arms of lending under one umbrella. This cut off the middleman fee and maximizes profitability for the most lucrative segment of SoFi&amp;#39;s businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wide diversity of SoFi business allows it to thrive in any macro environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SoFi&amp;#39;s Savings with direct deposit APY of 4.4% gives an extra push for deposit growth in subsequent quarters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SoFi Checking and Savings Offers Access to Up to $2 Million in FDIC Insurance ensuring depositors that their money above $250K won&amp;#39;t go up in smoke.&lt;/li&gt;

Comparing Kroger to other supermarket chains (like Walmart, Target or Cotsco) make the company seem extremely undervalued.

The biggest treat I can see is the competition from Whole Food and Amazon Fresh, but their stores aren't necesserely in the same cities, and taking over a grocery gigant like Kroger (2700 stores if I am not wrong) would be a very big task, requiring huge investments and crazy capex.

Bonus for the strong expected economic growth of the USA, especially the states where Kroger is well established, like Texas.

GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.  


# REVENUE:

I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB's actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I'd assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. ([SOURCE](https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html))  
  
Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.  
  
REVENUE MODEL: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/q1x5t39))  


# COST:

A cost breakdown of GRAB as of FY22 is 94.6% Incentive given to drivers, 19.5% Marketing, 45.1% G&amp;A, 32.5% R&amp;D. The percentage adds to more than 100% because GRAB is losing money.   
  
  
Taking ComfortDelGro (Traditional Taxi) and Kakao (Superapp) as reference for how much the margins should be for GRAB.  
Kakao’s EBIT margins for FY21 and 22 is 9.7% and 8.2% respectively.  
“ComfortDelGro’s taxi earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin is…15.6% in 2019” ([SOURCE](https://sbr.com.sg/transport-logistics/news/comfortdelgro-taxis-profit-margin-shrinks-2-in-2020-maybank-kim-eng))  
Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB's main business of being a ride hailing app.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

Taxes, GRAB's taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%. GRAB is based on the Cayman islands, but it does not seem possible for them to avoid taxes and since most of their business operations are done in Southeast Asia, I’d assume they will eventually move to Singapore and pay Singapore taxes.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of ""Adjusted EBITDA"" but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring ""One-Time off transaction"" and in turn rewards managements for beating their ""Adjusted EBITDA"". They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don't like the tale the management constantly spins about ""Adjusted EBITDA"", it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.

495,stocks,"Let's summarize the reasons why INTC is at the current price:

* \- Lagging behind in technology
* \- Poor track record of management
* \- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history
* \- Losing market share in most segments
* \- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues
* \- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush
* \- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days

&amp;#x200B;

Still, let's underline some facts:

**Market valuation landscape:**

* \- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold.
* \- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.

**Strategy:**

Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:

* \- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)
* \- Catching up to TSMC's tech

They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.

Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**

The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.

If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.

We already have positive things to say about their execution:

* \- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.
* \- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.
* \- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.
* \- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irrational fears:**

* \- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:

Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.

* \- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:

Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologise to anyone wanting a quick read but this is a long post because I think it's necessary to share my thought process that lead to my conclusion for this company. Please don't use this post as a reason to invest in Ferrari but rather see how I break down and analyse companies and maybe you can pick up a tip or two along the way! This post will also break down how I calculate the intrinsic value of Ferrari. This analysis is broken down into four sections:

1. History/Overview of the business
2. Business Segments 
3. Financial Highlights 
4. My Thoughts and Company Valuation 

***History/Overview of the Business:***

Ferrari is named after their founder Enzo Ferrari. An Alfa Romeo driver since 1924, Enzo Ferrari founded his own racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, in Modena in 1929 initially to race Alfa Romeo cars. In 1939 he set up his own company, initially called Auto Avio Costruzioni. In late 1943, Enzo Ferrari moved his headquarters from Modena to Maranello, which remains Ferrari's headquarters to this day.

Ferrari is among the world’s leading luxury brands, focused on the design, engineering, production and sale of the world’s most recognisable luxury performance sports cars. Their brand symbolizes exclusivity, innovation, state-of-the-art sporting performance and Italian design and engineering heritage. The name and history and the image enjoyed by Ferrari cars are closely associated with their Formula 1 racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, the most successful racing team in the history of Formula 1. From the inaugural year of Formula 1 in 1950 through the present, Scuderia Ferrari has won 242 Grand Prix races, 16 Constructors’ World Titles and 15 Drivers’ World titles. Ferrari are the only team which has taken part in all the editions of the Championship, racing in more than 1,000 Formula 1 Grand Prix races. 

Ferrari's product offering comprises four main pillars: Range, Special Series, Icona and Supercar. Ferrari targets end clients seeking high performance cars with distinctive design and state-of-the-art technology. Their target end clients can be divided into two main categories: on the one hand, the “Sports Car Driver”, a client looking for an elegant and understated design, who likes driving their car in a variety of locations and conditions, alone or with passengers, and who use their Ferrari for longer journeys, on the other hand, the “Pilot”, a client looking for a high performing and extreme sports car, who intend to drive their car on track and on challenging roads, and who are looking for an exciting driving experience.

Ferrari has a strategy of maintaining *low volumes compared to demand,* as well as to the higher number of models in our product portfolio and our more frequent launches compared to our competitors. We are not focused on market share as a performance metric. Instead, we deliberately manage our supply relative to demand, to defend and promote our brand exclusivity and premium pricing. Competition among similarly positioned luxury performance cars is also driven by price and total cost of ownership. Resilience of the car value after a period of ownership is an important competitive dimension among similarly positioned luxury cars, because higher resilience decreases the total cost of ownership and promotes repeat purchases: *this is a strong competitive advantage of Ferrari cars.* 

***Business Segments:***

*Design:*

The company has a Ferrari Design Centre, which is an in-house design department, with the objective of improving control over the entire design process and ensuring long-term continuity of the Ferrari style. ***A guiding principle of the Ferrari style is that each new model represents a clear departure from prior models*** and introduces new and distinctive aesthetic elements, delivering constant innovation within the furrow of tradition. Their designers, modelers and engineers work together to create car bodies that incorporate the most innovative aerodynamic solutions within the elegant and powerful lines typical of Ferrari cars. 

*Ferrari Classiche:*

The Ferrari Classiche department support Ferrari customers in managing the ***historic Ferrari vehicles (over 20 years from their production) with the objective of keeping as many of these classic cars on the road as possible.*** Services include the certification of the authenticity of classic Ferrari cars and vehicles of particular historical relevance, the management of Ferrari restoration and repair activities, as well as the management of Ferrari spare parts, including when these are no longer available on the market. The authenticity of the car with respect to the initial specifications is checked via a technical inspection and benefits from a comprehensive archive containing drawings of each of the individual chassis and details of historical components. Based on the evidence gathered during the inspection, the car is then presented to an expert committee, chaired by the founder’s son Pierro Ferrari, for the certification. 

We view the surviving Ferrari vehicles of historical value as the tangible legacy and incarnation of our brand. The Ferrari classiche department also supports and encourages the direct participation of clients in strategic historical events.   


*Sales Segments:*

Ferrari sells their cars exclusively through a network of authorised dealers. Ferrari also supplies parts for current and older models of Ferrari to our authorised dealer network. In addition, substitution of spare parts during the life of the car, sales are driven by clients’ demand for parts to customise their parts and maximise performance, particularly after a change in ownership, we well as parts required to compete in the Ferrari challenge and other client races. They also supply parts to Ferrari models currently out of production, with stocks dating back to 1995. The stock of parts for even older models is currently owned and managed by a third party which in some cases also manufactures out-of-stock parts based on our designs. The sale of parts is a profitable component of our product mix and is expected to benefit from the increase in the number of *Ferrari cars in circulation.* 

Ferrari has also been selling engines for Maserati since 2003. They also earn revenue from sponsorships from F1 racing, selling apparel merchandise, and leasing out their Mugello racetrack. 

*Driving Events, Circuit and Museum:* 

Ferrari hosts a wide range of driving events for owners and prospective owners. Ferrari also has their own Mugello racetrack along with two museums. The Museo Enzo Ferrari (MEF) is built around the house in which Enzo Ferrari was born in 1898. The MEF tells the story of Enzo Ferrari as a young boy discovering the irresistible allure of the world of motor racing, his career as a driver in the 1920s, as the driving force behind the Scuderia Ferrari in the 1930s, and then as Ferrari, the Constructor, from 1947 onwards. The Ferrari Museum Maranello invites visitors to experience the Prancing Horse dream first hand, offering them a journey through the Group’s history, values and automotive world.

***My thoughts:*** 

There are a lot of things I like about this company. I am going to go over some qualitative reasons and then go over quantitative reasons on why I like this company and then proceed to company valuation. 

*Qualitative reasons:* 

* Ferrari models each have a unique design meaning that each model is completely seperate from their prior models. This means that if you purchase a Ferrari, the car will *not depreciate in value* and older Ferrari models will hold heritage value. This is unique among car manufacturers. This is evident as we can see that more than 50% of Ferrari cars have been sold to existing owners. Most Ferrari owners end up becoming repeat purchasers and stay very loyal to the brand. 
* I had some fears about regulations in the auto industry pushing car manufacturers away from ICE engines. However, this doesn't seem to impact Ferrari as Hybrid models represented 22% of total shipment volume in 2022, up from 2% in 2020. Customers are still happy to purchase a Ferrari since 2022 had their highest shipment volumes in history. 
* Ferrari's management incentives are aligned with shareholders and is focused on the long-term. 	FERRARI has a loyalty voting program which is intended to reward shareholders for maintaining long-term share ownership by granting initial shareholders and persons holding their common shares continuously for at least three years the option to elect to receive special voting shares. Special voting shares cannot be traded and, if common shares participating in the loyalty program are sold they must be deregistered from the loyalty register and any corresponding special voting shares transferred to us for no consideration. Exor and Pierro Ferrari participate in the company’s loyalty voting program and, therefore, effectively hold two votes for each of the common shares they hold. Pierro Ferrari holds a 10% interest in the company. 
* As more Ferrari's cars come in circulation, the Ferrari's spare parts segment will continue to grow revenue as the years go on. This is because more clients will demand to have their cars optimised. 
* Worldwide car sales was around 67.2 million in 2022. Ferrari unit shipment was 13,221. **This brand is very** ***exclusive and holds scarcity value.*** 
* Ferrari engages in R&amp;D for their Formula 1 racing activities. While Ferrari develops these technologies for use in their Formula 1 cars, they seek to transfer these technologies and components to models in their current and future product portfolio. 

*Quantitative Reasons:* 

* Ferrari's revenue has increased every year since it went public
* Return on Net Tangible Assets have consistently been above 40% which is fantastic and this is with Net Tangible Assets growing every year!
* Return on Total Assets have remained at double digits in every year.
* Margins have increased since 2015

***Company Valuation:***

Ferrari's ambition is to launch 15 new models between 2023-2026 and I don't have much doubt they can achieve this since Ferrari has consistently delivered on their past ambitions. I have calculated the intrinsic value of Ferrari by applying the discounted cash flow calculator. Free Cash Flow is calculated by taking *cash flow from operations and subtract it by maintenance capital expenditures*. 

* I will not use a 17% growth rate since the past 5-year 17% growth was from 2017 (*Free cash Flow was second lowest at $468,359)* and it is also too optimistic. 
* Using a growth rate of 9-12% with a 10% discount rate, ***my buy price ranges from $150 to $195.*** I will purchase the company if price is slightly above this range because I am confident in the company's competitive position and management. 

I hope you enjoyed the analysis!

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things I like about this company. I am going to go over some qualitative reasons and then go over quantitative reasons on why I like this company and then proceed to company valuation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qualitative reasons:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferrari models each have a unique design meaning that each model is completely seperate from their prior models. This means that if you purchase a Ferrari, the car will &lt;em&gt;not depreciate in value&lt;/em&gt; and older Ferrari models will hold heritage value. This is unique among car manufacturers. This is evident as we can see that more than 50% of Ferrari cars have been sold to existing owners. Most Ferrari owners end up becoming repeat purchasers and stay very loyal to the brand. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had some fears about regulations in the auto industry pushing car manufacturers away from ICE engines. However, this doesn&amp;#39;t seem to impact Ferrari as Hybrid models represented 22% of total shipment volume in 2022, up from 2% in 2020. Customers are still happy to purchase a Ferrari since 2022 had their highest shipment volumes in history. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferrari&amp;#39;s management incentives are aligned with shareholders and is focused on the long-term.    FERRARI has a loyalty voting program which is intended to reward shareholders for maintaining long-term share ownership by granting initial shareholders and persons holding their common shares continuously for at least three years the option to elect to receive special voting shares. Special voting shares cannot be traded and, if common shares participating in the loyalty program are sold they must be deregistered from the loyalty register and any corresponding special voting shares transferred to us for no consideration. Exor and Pierro Ferrari participate in the company’s loyalty voting program and, therefore, effectively hold two votes for each of the common shares they hold. Pierro Ferrari holds a 10% interest in the company. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As more Ferrari&amp;#39;s cars come in circulation, the Ferrari&amp;#39;s spare parts segment will continue to grow revenue as the years go on. This is because more clients will demand to have their cars optimised. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide car sales was around 67.2 million in 2022. Ferrari unit shipment was 13,221. &lt;strong&gt;This brand is very&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;exclusive and holds scarcity value.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferrari engages in R&amp;amp;D for their Formula 1 racing activities. While Ferrari develops these technologies for use in their Formula 1 cars, they seek to transfer these technologies and components to models in their current and future product portfolio. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quantitative Reasons:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferrari&amp;#39;s revenue has increased every year since it went public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return on Net Tangible Assets have consistently been above 40% which is fantastic and this is with Net Tangible Assets growing every year!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return on Total Assets have remained at double digits in every year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margins have increased since 2015&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Company Valuation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferrari&amp;#39;s ambition is to launch 15 new models between 2023-2026 and I don&amp;#39;t have much doubt they can achieve this since Ferrari has consistently delivered on their past ambitions. I have calculated the intrinsic value of Ferrari by applying the discounted cash flow calculator. Free Cash Flow is calculated by taking &lt;em&gt;cash flow from operations and subtract it by maintenance capital expenditures&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will not use a 17% growth rate since the past 5-year 17% growth was from 2017 (&lt;em&gt;Free cash Flow was second lowest at $468,359)&lt;/em&gt; and it is also too optimistic. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a growth rate of 9-12% with a 10% discount rate, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;my buy price ranges from $150 to $195.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I will purchase the company if price is slightly above this range because I am confident in the company&amp;#39;s competitive position and management. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed the analysis!&lt;/p&gt;

I learned all of this from Ziptrader coupled with my own findings from trading over time. And even after several modfications to my strategy, the results have been mixed, with most of my trades being validated out (candlestick going under the 9ma line) and being forced to sell at a slight loss. With some large wins, overall break even. Iv always had this dout that my trading strategy is fundemnetally flawed, and that for me to be profitable, I have to implement fundemental aspects to my trading strategy. The problem is I have no idea where to start from. Since really, almost nobody is going to teach you their profitable trading strategy cause if everyone knows it then it wouldn't work, especially fundemental analysis.

&gt; # Sentiment Staying Bullish

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has continued its rally but sentiment has not exactly reflected that. The latest reading on investor sentiment from the AAII survey showed bullish sentiment dropped back below 50% this week. 44.5% of respondents reported as bullish in the past week which is right in line with the average reading of the past two months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The 6.5-point decline in bulls was only partially picked up by bearish sentiment which rose from 21.5% (the lowest level in over two years) to 24.1%. Albeit higher sequentially, that remains a muted reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment took home a larger share of the drop to bulls with the reading rising to 31% from 27.1%. That is only the most elevated reading in two weeks as neutral sentiment is the closest of any response to its respective historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-AAII-4.png))** 

&gt; While the AAII survey showed some moderation in optimism this week, that was not the case for other surveys. In last Thursday's Closer, we discussed how alongside the AAII survey, multiple other sentiment readings have tipped in favor of bulls recently. One such indicator that has continued to become more bullish is the NAAIM Exposure index which tracks the average equity exposure of active investment managers. Readings range from -200 to +200. -200/+200 would imply on average money managers are leveraged short/long, readings of -100/+100 would be fully short/long, and a reading of zero would be market neutral. This week the index tipped above 100 for the first time since late November 2021. In other words, active money managers are now fully long for the first time in over a year and a half. That streak of readings below 100 also ends as the fourth longest in the survey's history at 86 weeks in a row.

&gt; # Jobless Claims Back to Improving

&gt; It was a solid morning for economic data with a number of indicators coming in better than expected. Weekly jobless claims were one of those with seasonally adjusted initial claims unexpectedly falling to 221K from 228K last week and the lowest level since the second half of February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; Before seasonal adjustment, claims fell significantly week over week as could be expected for this point of the year. The 44.5K drop this week was in line with the average historical drop for the current week of the year as claims have fallen 80% of the time. Going forward, there will continue to be seasonal tailwinds through the end of summer before the typical fourth quarter turn higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; As for continuing claims, the seasonally adjusted reading likewise hit a new short-term low coming in at just 1.69 million. That is the lowest reading and first sub-1.7 million since the end of January. Combined with the initial claims reading, this recent data points to a return to strength in the labor market data following deterioration late last year through the early spring.

&gt; # Where the Jobs Were

&gt; In last night's Closer, we discussed the latest job postings data from job listings website Indeed. Compared to the official reading on labor market demand -- the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) -- which is released monthly at a two-month lag, this Indeed data is a daily look with much lower latency. The latest release as of Tuesday covers postings through July 21st. As shown below, postings remain in a downtrend in spite of a modest rebound in the latest month. Having tracked well with the official data, modeling JOLTS on the Indeed data would predict JOLTS to continue to fall to around 9.57 million for the June data scheduled to be released next week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-Indeed-1.png))**

&gt; The Indeed data also provides a good deal of demographic granularity based upon geographic areas. As shown below, the first two years of the pandemic had been a boon for smaller metro areas as they generally saw healthier readings on postings than the largest cities. While that dynamic moderated through the back half of 2021 through early 2022, the past year has seen the trend return. As shown in the charts below, postings have fallen regardless of MSA size, but larger metros have experienced a much more substantial drop. The smallest metros, on the other hand, have seen a much more modest decline, especially over the past several months. Check out the big drop in the second chart below showing the spread between the largest and smallest metros:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-Indeed-2.png))**

&gt; The data also provides a breakdown based on job industry. In the table below, we show the change in each industries' postings since the pre-pandemic baseline of early February 2020. Currently, there are six groups with a lower reading on postings versus pre-pandemic: IT Operations &amp; Helpdesk, Media &amp; Communications, Marketing, Information Documentation and Design, Software Development, and Mathematics. Meanwhile, several health care and engineering related roles continue to sit atop the list with the greatest post-pandemic growth in job postings. Finally, we would also note that some industries like Human Resources and logistics-related industries that saw postings boom on account of strong hiring and stressed supply chains have moderated. Today, those same indices now have postings that are middle of the pack at best.

&gt; # Emerging Markets (EEM) Attempts a Break Out

&gt; Today we published our most recent Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high level summary of 22 major economies. Taking a look at those same countries' stock markets via US traded ETFs, 2023 has seen broad rebounds in equity prices across the globe. At the moment, the average country ETF is 4.55% away from a 52-week high after posting a double-digit YTD gain. Based on developed and emerging countries, there has been some divergence. Both last year and again this year, emerging market equities have seen modest outperformance relative to developed markets. That has also been the case in July with an average gain of 5.24% for EM countries versus a 2.85% rise for their developed market peers. South Africa (EZA) is up the most month-to-date with a 10.2% gain, while France (EWQ) is up the least with a gain of just 13 bps so far in July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072623-GMD.png))**

&gt; From a technical perspective, the gains in emerging markets—proxied by the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM)—have resulted in a move above resistance at some of the past year's highs. As shown below, earlier in the spring and again only a couple of weeks ago, EEM attempted to retest the levels from last summer unsuccessfully. Today, EEM is back above those levels with the next resistance to watch being the January high at $42.50.

&gt; # 1st 8 or 9 Days of August Weaker Pre-Election Years

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/345224256ecb8d1ce20e12a6d06270ee/4bcc06987525e2f0-66/s500x750/e03274d8a5663643a4905fb0347b567aae67aca4.png))**

&gt; First eight or nine trading days of August have exhibited weakness while mid-month has been better. This pattern holds in pre-election years with greater magnitude (dashed lines). Note the bullish cluster from August 15 through 17. This strength is visible above on trading days 11, 12 and 13. The end of August tends to be softer when traders evacuate Wall Street for a summer finale. The last five days were generally bearish from 1996 to 2013 but have been positive in seven of the last nine years. In 2022, S&amp;P 500 dropped 4.5% in the last five trading days of August. S&amp;P 500 has also only been up nine times on the penultimate day of August in the past 27 years.

&gt; # Most Confident Consumers in Two Years

&gt; In case you didn't see it already, today's report on Consumer Confidence from the Conference Board showed that consumers are more confident than they have been at any point in the last two years. While there are still no shortage of negative macro headlines, with employment remaining strong, inflation easing, and the stock market in a bull market, you can't fault consumers for being more confident than they have been in recent history.

&gt; For some perspective on the current levels of consumer sentiment, the chart below shows historical readings of Consumer Confidence with red dots showing each time that the monthly reading made a new two-year high. As you can see, these types of readings aren't rare, especially during prolonged economic expansions, and as a corollary to the saying that it's often darkest before the dawn, sentiment tends to be brightest right up until sunset.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072523-Consumer-Confidence.png))**

&gt; In each of the prior periods where sentiment hit a two-year high just before the economy started to roll over, it was preceded by multiple occurrences of sentiment hitting new two-year highs. If we further filter out occurrences for periods when sentiment hit a two-year high for the first time in at least a year, the picture looks a lot different. In this case, there was never an occurrence just as the economy was on the verge of a recession, and most of them tended to occur early in the cycle rather than late. Interestingly enough, with all the debate over whether or not the economy is in a recession or not, the pattern of Consumer Confidence in the current period looks very much similar to the pattern during the double-dip recession of the early 1980s. Like the current period, back then there was a sharp drop and subsequent sharp rebound in confidence followed by another decline that failed to make a lower low. The only difference this time around is that following the initial COVID recession of 2020 there wasn't another recession in the next two years- at least not an officially declared recession.

&gt; # August Can Be Challenging in Pre-Election Years

&gt; Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best &gt; DJIA month from 1901 to 1951. Now it is the worst DJIA and second worst S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 month over the last 35 years, 1988-2022 with average performance ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to a –0.9% loss by DJIA. Last year, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, and Russell 1000 all declined over 4% in August.

&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1988; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998, with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2022 of over 4% by DJIA have widened its August average decline.

&gt; In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve modestly: #8 DJIA, #9 S&amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #11 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000. However, all five indexes have declined in August during the last three pre-election years, 2019, 2015 and 2011. It would appear, August’s pre-election year advantage is fading.

&lt;h1&gt;Sentiment Staying Bullish&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 has continued its rally but sentiment has not exactly reflected that. The latest reading on investor sentiment from the AAII survey showed bullish sentiment dropped back below 50% this week. 44.5% of respondents reported as bullish in the past week which is right in line with the average reading of the past two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-AAII-1.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 6.5-point decline in bulls was only partially picked up by bearish sentiment which rose from 21.5% (the lowest level in over two years) to 24.1%. Albeit higher sequentially, that remains a muted reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neutral sentiment took home a larger share of the drop to bulls with the reading rising to 31% from 27.1%. That is only the most elevated reading in two weeks as neutral sentiment is the closest of any response to its respective historical average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the AAII survey showed some moderation in optimism this week, that was not the case for other surveys. In last Thursday&amp;#39;s Closer, we discussed how alongside the AAII survey, multiple other sentiment readings have tipped in favor of bulls recently. One such indicator that has continued to become more bullish is the NAAIM Exposure index which tracks the average equity exposure of active investment managers. Readings range from -200 to +200. -200/+200 would imply on average money managers are leveraged short/long, readings of -100/+100 would be fully short/long, and a reading of zero would be market neutral. This week the index tipped above 100 for the first time since late November 2021. In other words, active money managers are now fully long for the first time in over a year and a half. That streak of readings below 100 also ends as the fourth longest in the survey&amp;#39;s history at 86 weeks in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobless Claims Back to Improving&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a solid morning for economic data with a number of indicators coming in better than expected. Weekly jobless claims were one of those with seasonally adjusted initial claims unexpectedly falling to 221K from 228K last week and the lowest level since the second half of February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before seasonal adjustment, claims fell significantly week over week as could be expected for this point of the year. The 44.5K drop this week was in line with the average historical drop for the current week of the year as claims have fallen 80% of the time. Going forward, there will continue to be seasonal tailwinds through the end of summer before the typical fourth quarter turn higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for continuing claims, the seasonally adjusted reading likewise hit a new short-term low coming in at just 1.69 million. That is the lowest reading and first sub-1.7 million since the end of January. Combined with the initial claims reading, this recent data points to a return to strength in the labor market data following deterioration late last year through the early spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Where the Jobs Were&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In last night&amp;#39;s Closer, we discussed the latest job postings data from job listings website Indeed. Compared to the official reading on labor market demand -- the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) -- which is released monthly at a two-month lag, this Indeed data is a daily look with much lower latency. The latest release as of Tuesday covers postings through July 21st. As shown below, postings remain in a downtrend in spite of a modest rebound in the latest month. Having tracked well with the official data, modeling JOLTS on the Indeed data would predict JOLTS to continue to fall to around 9.57 million for the June data scheduled to be released next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indeed data also provides a good deal of demographic granularity based upon geographic areas. As shown below, the first two years of the pandemic had been a boon for smaller metro areas as they generally saw healthier readings on postings than the largest cities. While that dynamic moderated through the back half of 2021 through early 2022, the past year has seen the trend return. As shown in the charts below, postings have fallen regardless of MSA size, but larger metros have experienced a much more substantial drop. The smallest metros, on the other hand, have seen a much more modest decline, especially over the past several months. Check out the big drop in the second chart below showing the spread between the largest and smallest metros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data also provides a breakdown based on job industry. In the table below, we show the change in each industries&amp;#39; postings since the pre-pandemic baseline of early February 2020. Currently, there are six groups with a lower reading on postings versus pre-pandemic: IT Operations &amp;amp; Helpdesk, Media &amp;amp; Communications, Marketing, Information Documentation and Design, Software Development, and Mathematics. Meanwhile, several health care and engineering related roles continue to sit atop the list with the greatest post-pandemic growth in job postings. Finally, we would also note that some industries like Human Resources and logistics-related industries that saw postings boom on account of strong hiring and stressed supply chains have moderated. Today, those same indices now have postings that are middle of the pack at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Emerging Markets (EEM) Attempts a Break Out&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we published our most recent Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high level summary of 22 major economies. Taking a look at those same countries&amp;#39; stock markets via US traded ETFs, 2023 has seen broad rebounds in equity prices across the globe. At the moment, the average country ETF is 4.55% away from a 52-week high after posting a double-digit YTD gain. Based on developed and emerging countries, there has been some divergence. Both last year and again this year, emerging market equities have seen modest outperformance relative to developed markets. That has also been the case in July with an average gain of 5.24% for EM countries versus a 2.85% rise for their developed market peers. South Africa (EZA) is up the most month-to-date with a 10.2% gain, while France (EWQ) is up the least with a gain of just 13 bps so far in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, the gains in emerging markets—proxied by the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM)—have resulted in a move above resistance at some of the past year&amp;#39;s highs. As shown below, earlier in the spring and again only a couple of weeks ago, EEM attempted to retest the levels from last summer unsuccessfully. Today, EEM is back above those levels with the next resistance to watch being the January high at $42.50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1st 8 or 9 Days of August Weaker Pre-Election Years&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/345224256ecb8d1ce20e12a6d06270ee/4bcc06987525e2f0-66/s500x750/e03274d8a5663643a4905fb0347b567aae67aca4.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First eight or nine trading days of August have exhibited weakness while mid-month has been better. This pattern holds in pre-election years with greater magnitude (dashed lines). Note the bullish cluster from August 15 through 17. This strength is visible above on trading days 11, 12 and 13. The end of August tends to be softer when traders evacuate Wall Street for a summer finale. The last five days were generally bearish from 1996 to 2013 but have been positive in seven of the last nine years. In 2022, S&amp;amp;P 500 dropped 4.5% in the last five trading days of August. S&amp;amp;P 500 has also only been up nine times on the penultimate day of August in the past 27 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Most Confident Consumers in Two Years&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you didn&amp;#39;t see it already, today&amp;#39;s report on Consumer Confidence from the Conference Board showed that consumers are more confident than they have been at any point in the last two years. While there are still no shortage of negative macro headlines, with employment remaining strong, inflation easing, and the stock market in a bull market, you can&amp;#39;t fault consumers for being more confident than they have been in recent history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some perspective on the current levels of consumer sentiment, the chart below shows historical readings of Consumer Confidence with red dots showing each time that the monthly reading made a new two-year high. As you can see, these types of readings aren&amp;#39;t rare, especially during prolonged economic expansions, and as a corollary to the saying that it&amp;#39;s often darkest before the dawn, sentiment tends to be brightest right up until sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each of the prior periods where sentiment hit a two-year high just before the economy started to roll over, it was preceded by multiple occurrences of sentiment hitting new two-year highs. If we further filter out occurrences for periods when sentiment hit a two-year high for the first time in at least a year, the picture looks a lot different. In this case, there was never an occurrence just as the economy was on the verge of a recession, and most of them tended to occur early in the cycle rather than late. Interestingly enough, with all the debate over whether or not the economy is in a recession or not, the pattern of Consumer Confidence in the current period looks very much similar to the pattern during the double-dip recession of the early 1980s. Like the current period, back then there was a sharp drop and subsequent sharp rebound in confidence followed by another decline that failed to make a lower low. The only difference this time around is that following the initial COVID recession of 2020 there wasn&amp;#39;t another recession in the next two years- at least not an officially declared recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;August Can Be Challenging in Pre-Election Years&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best &amp;gt; DJIA month from 1901 to 1951. Now it is the worst DJIA and second worst S&amp;amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 month over the last 35 years, 1988-2022 with average performance ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to a –0.9% loss by DJIA. Last year, DJIA, S&amp;amp;P 500, NASDAQ, and Russell 1000 all declined over 4% in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributing to this poor performance since 1988; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998, with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2022 of over 4% by DJIA have widened its August average decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve modestly: #8 DJIA, #9 S&amp;amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #11 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000. However, all five indexes have declined in August during the last three pre-election years, 2019, 2015 and 2011. It would appear, August’s pre-election year advantage is fading.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the good:

Revenues grew 12.0% YOY on a CC basis (this post will be CC) to 1.072B with Crocs growing 14.9% to 833m with a **38.9%** operating margin.

Consolidated adjusted Operating margin was 30.3%

$299.1 million of debt was paid down reducing total debt to $2B.

Due to gross leverage now being 1.8x, Crocs is now able to resume share repurchases. As a result, Crocs bought 400,000 shares for $50 million at an average cost of $117

In addition, full year guidance is now being raised to $4B-$4.06B with an adjusted operating margin of 27.5%, representing 12.5%-14.5% revenue growth and an operating margin expansion of 50 to 150 bp.

This compares favorably to a prior guidance of 11%-14% revenue growth and adjusted operating margin of 26%.

Here's the bad:

Q3 guidance was very disappointing, only showing 3-5% revenue growth YoY in consolidated revenue. Adjusted operating margin remains high at 27.0%.

Furthermore, HEYDUDE is showing lackluster growth for 2023. Sales grew **just 3%** YoY to 239m in 2Q2023. As a result, Crocs issued a guidance cut for HEYDUDE: 14-18% revenue growth vs previous mid-20% growth. This was explained in the earnings call: HEYDUDE does not have a long track history, resulting in wholesalers not agreeing to sell them. However, the CEO believes this is just a short term impasse and will be insignificant for the long term growth of HEYDUDE. 

In addition, HEYDUDE has been unable to show margin expansion with gross margins growing 0 bp and operating margins decreasing 500 bp YoY.

Takeaway:

Crocs is telling shareholders HEYDUDE is dragging down Crocs as a whole. While their core revenue segment crocs is a cash cow, with an operating margin of **38.4%**, HEYDUDE is very meager at just **27.6%** for 2Q2023. That being said, Crocs is picking up the slack with increased revenue growth and improved profitablity, allowing Crocs to lift their full year guidance and profitability metrics.

At just a 10 P/E and a 6.5B market cap, you are paying just 1.5X 2023 sales. I continue to believe Crocs is massively undervalued by at least 100%, and believe Crocs will turn HEYDUDE around and become a 20B company within the next 5 years with CEO Andrew Rees leading the way.

As a result, Crocs issued a guidance cut for HEYDUDE: 14-18% revenue growth vs previous mid-20% growth. This was explained in the earnings call: HEYDUDE does not have a long track history, resulting in wholesalers not agreeing to sell them. However, the CEO believes this is just a short term impasse and will be insignificant for the long term growth of HEYDUDE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, HEYDUDE has been unable to show margin expansion with gross margins growing 0 bp and operating margins decreasing 500 bp YoY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crocs is telling shareholders HEYDUDE is dragging down Crocs as a whole. While their core revenue segment crocs is a cash cow, with an operating margin of &lt;strong&gt;38.4%&lt;/strong&gt;, HEYDUDE is very meager at just &lt;strong&gt;27.6%&lt;/strong&gt; for 2Q2023. That being said, Crocs is picking up the slack with increased revenue growth and improved profitablity, allowing Crocs to lift their full year guidance and profitability metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At just a 10 P/E and a 6.5B market cap, you are paying just 1.5X 2023 sales. I continue to believe Crocs is massively undervalued by at least 100%, and believe Crocs will turn HEYDUDE around and become a 20B company within the next 5 years with CEO Andrew Rees leading the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasoning for undervaluation: 4.0B sales in 2023 * 27.5% operating margin * 13 P/E = 14B market cap&lt;/p&gt;

Goldman and a group of investors has agreed an all cash offer for Kahoot! I’m a shareholder but the price offer is below my purchase price and hence I am reluctant to sell. 

It is not clear to me from the offer if I can be required to sell and whether the investor group has already secured enough ownership to make a squeeze. 

The full offer can be found here:

Any advice would be very welcome? Can I end up with shares in a private company in case I vote no?

I believe these are the most important paragraphs:

“Minimum Acceptance: valid acceptance of the Offer by Shareholders representing (when taken together with any Shares acquired or agreed to be acquired by the Offeror other than through the Offer, or which the Offeror is otherwise entitled) more than 90% of the issued and outstanding share capital and voting rights of Kahoot!, and such acceptances not being subject to any third party consents in respect to pledges or other rights”

“If as a result of the Offer, the Offeror acquires and holds more than 90% of all Shares representing more than 90% of the voting rights in Kahoot!, the Offeror will have the right and intends to carry out a compulsory acquisition of the remaining Shares.“

“In total, Shares representing c.34.20% of Kahoot!’s outstanding share capital as at the date of this announcement (the “Outstanding Share Capital”) are committed to be sold”

“The largest Shareholder, General Atlantic, a leading global growth equity firm, alongside other Shareholders including KIRKBI, Glitrafjord AS (vehicle controlled by Kahoot!’s CEO Eilert Hanoa), certain other investors and certain members of the Kahoot! management team (including via a pooling vehicle) have entered into an investment agreement with Goldman Sachs Asset Management (the “Investment Agreement”) in which they, on certain terms and conditions, agree to (i) contribute, upon completion of the Offer, certain of their Shares representing c.26.68% of the Outstanding Share Capital”

But the company released a gloomy outlook for its fiscal 2024 sales that fell short of Wall Street’s estimates.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.37 vs. $1.32 expected

Revenue: $20.55 billion vs. $19.98 billion expected

The Tide detergent owner reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $3.38 billion, or $1.37 per share, up from $3.05 billion, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier.

Net sales rose 5% to $20.55 billion.

For fiscal 2024, P&amp;G is forecasting that its revenue will grow 3% to 4%, lower than Wall Street’s expectations of 4.5% sales growth. The company is also projecting earnings per share growth of 6% to 9%, which is on the lower end of analysts’ forecast of 8.8%.

#[Stock futures are higher as investors look toward Fed’s favorite inflation gauge: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures ticked up early Friday as Wall Street awaited new inflation data due Friday morning.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 57 points, or 0.16% higher. S&amp;P 500 futures were up by 0.38%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.77%.
*****
&gt; A mixed batch of earnings reports sent stocks in diverging directions after hours. Intel jumped more than 7% as investors applauded a return to profitability, while Roku climbed 8% after beating Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines.
*****
&gt; Ford Motor shares, however, fell about 1.4% even though the automaker beat estimates and raised guidance. The company said its electric vehicle adoption was taking longer than expected due to higher costs.
*****
&gt; Investors will watch for June data for the personal consumption expenditures price index, a gauge of inflation that’s closely followed by the Federal Reserve. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect that the core PCE gained 0.2% from the prior month and climbed 4.2% when compared with a year earlier.
*****
&gt; The data is of particular interest after the central bank raised interest rates earlier this week in a widely expected move. The Fed targets inflation at 2% annually.
*****
&gt; “We don’t have to love the Fed, but we know how they think,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. “Given that most people think the Fed won’t increase again, if this PCE number comes in hot, then that’s going to shake that confidence. We think it’s going to print cool, but you never know until you know.”
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a losing session. The Dow’s nearly 0.7% tumble marked the end of a 13-day win streak, a length not seen since 1987. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each finished around 0.6% lower.
*****
&gt; The Dow and the Nasdaq are on pace for narrow weekly gains. The 30-stock average is up 0.16%, while the tech-heavy index has a 0.12% gain through Thursday’s close. The S&amp;P 500 is flat on the week, up only 0.02%.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere on Friday, investors will watch for data on employment costs, personal income, consumer spending and consumer sentiment. Corporate earnings season continues with Procter &amp; Gamble, expected to report before the bell.

Economists polled by Dow Jones expect that the core PCE gained 0.2% from the prior month and climbed 4.2% when compared with a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data is of particular interest after the central bank raised interest rates earlier this week in a widely expected move. The Fed targets inflation at 2% annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have to love the Fed, but we know how they think,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. “Given that most people think the Fed won’t increase again, if this PCE number comes in hot, then that’s going to shake that confidence. We think it’s going to print cool, but you never know until you know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is coming off a losing session. The Dow’s nearly 0.7% tumble marked the end of a 13-day win streak, a length not seen since 1987. The S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each finished around 0.6% lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dow and the Nasdaq are on pace for narrow weekly gains. The 30-stock average is up 0.16%, while the tech-heavy index has a 0.12% gain through Thursday’s close. The S&amp;amp;P 500 is flat on the week, up only 0.02%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere on Friday, investors will watch for data on employment costs, personal income, consumer spending and consumer sentiment. Corporate earnings season continues with Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, expected to report before the bell.&lt;/p&gt;

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

518,stocks,"Due to expenses related to their merger with Sprint, T-Mobile US, Inc. has had negative EPS for three years in a row. Due to management's successful handling of the integration, TMUS is well-positioned to start reaping the rewards of their merger with Sprint. Since 2020, TMUS has spent a lot of money attempting to merge the two businesses. With approximately $4.9 billion in merger-related costs, 2022 was the most expensive year to date. This procedure has hurt the company's bottom line, but the corporation is now moving towards a situation where the advantages will start to exceed the disadvantages.   
The management anticipates that the final $1 billion in merger-related costs will be mostly recovered by the end of 2023, according to the most recent annual report. However, according to latest management projections, merger synergies will be realised in the range of 7.3 and 7.5 billion in 2023. Overall, it appears that the merger went fairly well because management was able to keep expenditures under control for three to four years while also adding 40 million new users to its platform. As a result, I predict that TMUS's financial performance will significantly increase during the coming years.  
Nonetheless, there are still some risks to the company itself. In the industry where TMUS competes, there are only a few dominant companies. Profitability can suffer if several smaller firms are successful in breaking into the market. Their debt-to-equity ratio right now is 1.64x. Despite not being ideal, it is not out of the ordinary for the sector. 9.8 billion in current debt and 9.6 billion in cash are held by the corporation. However, with over 98 billion in long-term debt, it is the majority of the debt. Despite these dangers, TMUS expects to boost profitability in 2023 as a result of cost savings and increased synergies from their most recent merger.

525,stocks,"###If Fed achieves a soft landing, history suggests economy could keep growing four or five more years

Economic expansions don’t die of old age, economists like to say; they are murdered by the Federal Reserve.

No wonder, then, that as the Fed has raised interest rates 5.25 percentage points since early last year, including a quarter point Wednesday, forecasters have predicted a recession was imminent. 

But they have postponed the recession’s start date as growth remains steady. The economy grew a better-than-expected 2.4%, annualized, in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.

Actually, in one respect a recession in the next six months would be unusual. It would mean the current expansion, which began in April 2020, will have lasted just four years. That is less than half the 8.6-year average of the four prior expansions, dating back to 1982.

This shows what is at stake in the Fed’s current balancing act. It hopes rates have risen enough to push inflation down, but not enough to push the economy into contraction—a so-called soft landing. Based on the actuarial tables, a soft landing would mean another four or five years before the next recession. 

On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a soft landing has long been his base case, and his confidence in it had grown. “We’ve seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market,” he told reporters after the Fed’s policy meeting. “That’s a really good thing.” 

Powell also disclosed that the Fed staff, which earlier this year projected a recession, no longer does. The staff forecast doesn’t necessarily reflect policy makers’ own views. 

The second-quarter report on gross domestic product also helped the case for a soft landing. The 2.4% growth rate was faster than the economy’s long-run trend, mostly thanks to business investment. Consumer spending grew a relatively subdued 1.6%. Inflation excluding food and energy, by the Fed’s preferred measure, was lower than economists expected, at 3.8% annualized for the quarter. Though still far above the Fed’s 2% target, that was still the lowest in over two years.

***A pre-1981 or post-1981 business cycle?***

The prospects of avoiding a recession depend on what sort of business cycle this is. Since 1945, there have been 12 expansions and 13 recessions, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the academic organization that dates business cycles.

Until 1981, expansions lasted an average of 3.7 years and usually ended because the Fed raised interest rates in response to some combination of an overheating economy and inflation. 

But in 1981, then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker engineered a deep recession, and inflation began a long decline, eventually stabilizing around 2%. In 1984 and again in 1994, the Fed raised rates before inflation actually took off, and the economy kept growing for six more years.

Several factors extended the lifespan of expansions. Globalization, brisk labor-force growth and technology put downward pressure on costs. As the public came to expect lower inflation, they set wages and prices accordingly. Spikes in oil prices petered out without feeding a broader wage-price spiral. Low inflation’s self-sustaining nature meant less need for recessions to lower it. 

The four expansions since 1981 have ranged from six to nearly 11 years. Instead of inflation, they usually ended with some sort of financial crackup: the technology bust in 2001, or the bursting of the housing and mortgage bubble in 2007. 

The record, near-11 year expansion that ended in February 2020 was unique, killed off not by inflation or a financial crisis, but by a pandemic and lockdowns. Without that, it might still be going on.  

[**Number of years of each economic expansion**](https://i.imgur.com/sIuFiLM.png)

So does the current cycle have more in common with the shorter, pre-1981 vintage, or the longer, post-1981 type? If the latter, the good news is that the vulnerabilities and imbalances that led to financial meltdowns in the past seem absent now. The financial system survived the pandemic shutdown in early 2020.

Higher interest rates usually lead to some unforeseen financial crunch. This time, they sank three regional banks earlier this year. But so far, contagion has been limited and the hit to bank lending seems modest.

In a report this week, Bank of America economists said much of the risk of rising interest rates has been absorbed by either the Fed or banks through their purchases of Treasury bonds, whose prices fell as rates rose. The good news is, “the Fed has the mandate, the tools, the acumen, the data, and the experience to tackle emergent stresses in the banking system.”

***A plausible case that this time is different ***

On its face, the current cycle looks a lot like those of the 1960s and 1970s: overheated, and afflicted with inflation.

When the Fed pulled off the 1984 and 1994 soft landings, unemployment was much higher than today’s 3.6%, and wages were growing moderately. In other words, the labor market wasn’t overheating. By contrast, as Powell noted, the demand for workers today is still well above the supply. 

The Fed has never pulled off a soft landing when inflation was so far above its goal and the labor market this overheated. 

Still, there is a plausible case this time is different. In the past, inflation was usually caused by excess demand. This time, a bigger culprit is disrupted supply—of goods, transportation, commodities, labor—in the wake of the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Supply is returning. Vehicle production, previously held back by a shortage of semiconductors, soared 20%, annualized, in the second quarter. This enabled businesses to sharply boost investment in equipment, even as prices for that equipment fell for the first time in two years.

Meanwhile, robust demand for workers has been met by a surge in supply: The share of the population aged 25 to 54 either working or looking for work—the participation rate—is now higher than before the recession.

And despite tight labor markets, a wage price spiral isn’t yet apparent. Unlike before 1981, the public’s long-term expectations of inflation are stable, at around 2% to 3%.

On the negative side, structural factors that restrained costs in past decades have reversed: Thanks to geopolitical tensions and protectionism, globalization has gone into reverse, and aging populations have sapped labor-force growth. Maybe artificial intelligence will supercharge productivity, but for now that is purely hypothetical. 

These forces mean that even if the Fed gets inflation down without killing the economy in the coming year, the stay of execution isn’t guaranteed to last.

For the period ending July 1, Intel (INTC) earned an adjusted 13 cents per share on $12.9B in revenue, as the company's Client Computing Group generated $6.78B in revenue, above estimates. 

Revenue attributed to its Data Center and AI group fell 15% year-over-year to $4B, while Network and Edge revenue dropped 38% to $1.4B. Intel's nascent foundry unit saw a 307% surge in revenue to $232M.

The company also generated $454M in revenue attributed to Mobileye (MBLY), which it partially spun-off in October 2022.

A consensus of analysts expected  the company to lose 3 cents per share on $12.14B in revenue.

Sadly, those losses have pretty much become par for the course. **The NBCUniversal streaming platform lost $704 million in the prior quarter (and $467 million in Q2 2022). The company expects to post “peak” losses from streaming — to the tune of $3 billion — in 2023.** Good thing Comcast is soon to come into about $9 billion in streaming bucks through the sale of its Hulu stake to Disney.

Peacock revenue rose 85 percent year to year, mostly thanks to advertising, as the vast majority of subs are on the service’s “Premium” tier. Until recently (and since its June 2020 launch), the ad-supported option cost $4.99 per month; following a July price hike it’s now $5.99. Commercial-free “Premium Plus” increased from $9.99/month to $11.99/month.

NBCU parent company Comcast did top Wall Street’s earnings and revenue expectations for the second quarter of 2023. Media analysts collectively forecast Comcast’s Q2 earnings at 97 cents per share on revenue of $30.13 billion. The company reported $1.13 of adjusted earnings per share (or $1.02 without adjustments) on $30.51 billion in revenue. Net income was $4.72 billion.

In a prepared statement, Comcast’s Chairman and CEO Brian L. Roberts called the financial results “excellent.” He shouted out Theme Parks for their “best quarterly adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) ever.”

He’ll have much more to say at 8:30 a.m. today, when Comcast’s senior executive team hosts a conference call to discuss the quarterly results in greater detail. We expect some strikes talk, and about a half-million mentions of “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” Hey, Universal Pictures has earned it.

“Mario,” an April 5 release, made more than a half-billion dollars domestically and more than $1.3 billion at the worldwide box office. It almost single-handedly sent the quarter’s theatrical revenue soaring 66 percent vs. the same three-month period in 2022.

Hello all, I was beating the drum on TUP since $1.33. Looks like we had a nice little pop. I have liquidated almost all of my holdings in TUP. Currently holding 25 shares at $2.00. I have 1 put at $2 as well. I like to buy put options close to or ATM w/ long positions in stock. Nice little hedge to protect you from any downside.

My next speculative call is LCID. As of July 14. There are 2.27B shares Outs. Float of 406,097,447. Short Interest 167,766,715, roughly 41%. I do not necessarily see this as a squeeze yet. However, Bank of America just announced  that $90/ barrel is imminent. The oil supply in the US has drastically been declining. This will lead to higher prices for anything utilizing oil (Plastic, Gas, Polyurethane, Solvents, ETC.) This usually leads to people searching for cheaper alternatives.  Which is why LCID (EV in general) and anything pertaining to oil is on my watchlist. I wouldn't be surprised to see a dip and rip with anything oil. 


WMT, I have been watching for quite some time now (over a year). I have a fairly large position in Walmart (over 100)  at strikes from $165-$220, about 90% expiring Dec.. Walmart started in January 2022 developing their own crypto coin. The CTO of Walmart, in October of 22' said he expects crypto to be a major payment disruptor and a very important payment tool to use. In June of 2023, they opened their second automation facility. If that isn't enough, Walmart is a major contributor in the AI industry. They have embedded AI all over their facilities and have been buying AI IP. The  FTC is also looking into Amazons rigged search results and how they advertise for business owners. Sounds like they are forcing businesses to pay more for a higher product ranking. This is among a slew of other antitrust violations. amazon could be a great short with Walmart gaining market share. If the FTC follows through on their Amazon lawsuit and they succeed at breaking up amazon. It stands to reason that Walmart will gain the majority of Amazons market share.

539,stocks,"In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.

He soon realized he was sometimes getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.

“We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter.

Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.”

What Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.

The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter.

Inside the Nevada team’s office, some employees celebrated canceling service appointments by putting their phones on mute and striking a metal xylophone, triggering applause from coworkers who sometimes stood on desks. The team often closed hundreds of cases a week and staffers were tracked on their average number of diverted appointments per day.

Managers told the employees that they were saving Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on service centers, some of which had long waits for appointments.

In most cases, the complaining customers’ cars likely did not need repair, according to the people familiar with the matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints another way – by hyping the range of its futuristic electric vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and the projections provided by the cars’ own equipment, according to Reuters interviews with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the company’s vehicles.

Neither Tesla nor Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for this story.

Reuters reporter Steve Stecklow discusses how Tesla has been exaggerating the driving range of its vehicles for years.
Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles’ potential driving distance – by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers “rosy” projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts.

Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a “safety buffer,” allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.

The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said.

“Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,” the person said, adding: “When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.”

Tesla’s intentional inflation of in-dash range-meter projections and the creation of its range-complaints diversion team have not been previously reported.

Driving range is among the most important factors in consumer decisions on which electric car to buy, or whether to buy one at all. So-called range anxiety – the fear of running out of power before reaching a charger – has been a primary obstacle to boosting electric-vehicle sales.

At the time Tesla programmed in the rosy range projections, it was selling only two models: the two-door Roadster, its first vehicle, which was later discontinued; and the Model S, a luxury sport sedan launched in 2012. It now sells four models: two cars, the 3 and S; and two crossover SUVs, the X and Y. Tesla plans the return of the Roadster, along with a “Cybertruck” pickup.

Reuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates. But automotive testers and regulators continue to flag the company for exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel before their batteries run out.

Tesla was fined earlier this year by South Korean regulators who found the cars delivered as little as half their advertised range in cold weather. Another recent study found that three Tesla models averaged 26% below their advertised ranges.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required Tesla since the 2020 model year to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to advertise for six of its vehicles by an average of 3%. The EPA told Reuters, however, that it expects some variation between the results of separate tests conducted by automakers and the agency.

Data collected in 2022 and 2023 from more than 8,000 Teslas by Recurrent, a Seattle-based EV analytics company, showed that the cars’ dashboard range meters didn’t change their estimates to reflect hot or cold outside temperatures, which can greatly reduce range.

Recurrent found that Tesla’s four models almost always calculated that they could travel more than 90% of their advertised EPA range estimates regardless of external temperatures. Scott Case, Recurrent’s chief executive, told Reuters that Tesla’s range meters also ignore many other conditions affecting driving distance.

Electric cars can lose driving range for a lot of the same reasons as gasoline cars — but to a greater degree. The cold is a particular drag on EVs, slowing the chemical and physical reactions inside their batteries and requiring a heating system to protect them. Other drains on the battery include hilly terrain, headwinds, a driver’s lead foot and running the heating or air-conditioning inside the cabin.

Tesla discusses the general effect of such conditions in a “Range Tips” section of its website. The automaker also recently updated its vehicle software to provide a breakdown of battery consumption during recent trips with suggestions on how range might have been improved.

Tesla vehicles provide range estimates in two ways: One through a dashboard meter of current range that’s always on, and a second projection through its navigation system, which works when a driver inputs a specific destination. The navigation system’s range estimate, Case said, does account for a wider set of conditions, including temperature. While those estimates are “more realistic,” they still tend to overstate the distance the car can travel before it needs to be recharged, he said.

Recurrent tested other automakers’ in-dash range meters –  including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Hyundai Kona – and found them to be more accurate. The Kona’s range meter generally underestimated the distance the car could travel, the tests showed. Recurrent conducted the study with the help of a National Science Foundation grant.

Tesla, Case said, has consistently designed the range meters in its cars to deliver aggressive rather than conservative estimates: “That’s where Tesla has taken a different path from most other automakers.”

Failed tests and false advertising

Tesla isn’t the only automaker with cars that don’t regularly achieve their advertised ranges.

One of the experts, Gregory Pannone, co-authored a study of 21 different brands of electric vehicles, published in April by SAE International, an engineering organization. The research found that, on average, the cars fell short of their advertised ranges by 12.5% in highway driving.

The study did not name the brands tested, but Pannone told Reuters that three Tesla models posted the worst performance, falling short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26%.

The EV pioneer pushes the limits of government testing regulations that govern the claims automakers put on window stickers, the three automotive experts told Reuters.

Like their gas-powered counterparts, new electric vehicles are required by U.S. federal law to display a label with fuel-efficiency information. In the case of EVs, this is stated in miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe), allowing consumers to compare them to gasoline or diesel vehicles. The labels also include estimates of total range: how far an EV can travel on a full charge, in combined city and highway driving.

“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.”

EV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model’s range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran.

Tesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA’s formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said.

Mercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA’s formula because it believes it provides a more accurate estimate. “We follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,” the German carmaker said in a statement.

Ford and Porsche didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Whatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year.

EPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars’ estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla’s range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers.

The EPA said it has seen “everything” in its audits of EV manufacturers’ range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers. “That is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market  and why EPA prioritizes” auditing them, the agency said.

The EPA cautioned that individuals’ actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles.

Pannone called Tesla “the most aggressive” electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations.

“I’m not suggesting they’re cheating,” Pannone said of Tesla. “What they’re doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.”

Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.

All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.

Tesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla’s in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.

Only two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds reported in March 2021. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.

Edmunds has continued to test electric vehicles, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.

“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,” Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can “misrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.”

South Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars’ range. It cited tests by the country’s environment ministry that showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company’s claimed ranges in cold weather.

The KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla’s website, including one that claimed about a particular model: “You can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.” Regulators required Tesla to remove the “or longer” phrase.

Korean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging “false/exaggerated advertising.”

Creating a diversion

By last year, sales of Tesla’s electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.

As sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team’s operations.

Tesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its “virtual” service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.

Tesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla “Virtual Service Advisor” described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: “Divert customers who do not require in person service.”

Such advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the Las Vegas “Diversion Team” to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.

The office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had purchased the metallophone – a xylophone with metal keys – that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office’s operations.

Advisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers’ cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range. Advisors would offer tips on extending range by changing driving habits.

If the remote diagnostics found anything else wrong with the vehicle that was not related to driving range, advisors were instructed not to tell the customer, one of the sources said. Managers told them to close the cases.

Tesla also updated its phone app so that any customer who complained about range could no longer book service appointments, one of the sources said. Instead, they could request that someone from Tesla contact them. It often took several days before owners were contacted because of the large backlog of range complaints, the source said.


Tesla recently stopped owners from using its app to book service appointments relating to complaints about driving range. Instead, it gave them tips on increasing range and directed their inquiries to a “Diversion Team” tasked with preventing service-center visits.
The update routed all U.S. range complaints to the Nevada diversion team, which started in Las Vegas and later moved to the nearby suburb of Henderson. The team was soon fielding up to 2,000 cases a week, which sometimes included multiple complaints from customers frustrated they couldn't book a service appointment, one of the people said.

The team was expected to close about 750 cases a week. To accomplish that, office supervisors told advisers to call a customer once and, if there was no answer, to close the case as unresponsive, the source said. When customers did respond, advisers were told to try to complete the call in no more than five minutes.

In late 2022, managers aiming to quickly close cases told advisors to stop running remote diagnostic tests on the vehicles of owners who had reported range problems, according to one of the people familiar with the diversion team’s operations.

“Thousands of customers were told there is nothing wrong with their car” by advisors who had never run diagnostics, the person said.

Reuters could not establish how long the practice continued.

Tesla recently stopped using its diversion team in Nevada to handle range-related complaints, according to the person familiar with the matter. Virtual service advisors in an office in Utah are now handling range cases, the person said. Reuters could not determine why the change was made.


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signs off on fuel economy and driving range estimates.

The EPA required Tesla to slightly lower driving range estimates that it planned to put on window stickers for six recent models after the agency’s own testing. But the EPA said such variation is not uncommon in testing by makers of electric vehicles.
On the road

By the time Alexandre Ponsin reached California on his March road trip, he had stopped to charge his Model 3’s battery about a dozen times.

Concerned that something was seriously wrong with the car, he had called and texted with several Tesla representatives. One of them booked the first available appointment in Santa Clara – about two weeks away – but advised him to show up at a Tesla service center as soon as he arrived in California.

Ponsin soon received a text saying that remote diagnostics had shown his battery “is in good health.”

“We would like to cancel your visit for now if you have no other concerns,” the text read.

“Of course I still have concerns,” Ponsin shot back. “I have 150 miles of range on a full charge!”

The next day, he received another text message asking him to cancel the appointment. “I am sorry, but no I do not want to close the service appointment as I do not feel my concerns have been addressed,” he replied.

Undeterred, Ponsin brought his car to the Santa Clara service center without an appointment. A technician there told him the car was fine. “It lasted 10 minutes,” Ponsin said, “and they didn’t even look at the car physically.”

After doing more research into range estimates, he said he ultimately concluded there is nothing wrong with his car. The problem, he said, was that Tesla is overstating its performance. He believes Tesla “should be a lot more explicit about the variation in the range,” especially in very cold weather.

“I do love my Tesla,” the engineer said. “But I have just tempered my expectation of what it can do in certain conditions.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3.

&lt;p&gt;“They&amp;#39;ve gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model’s range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA’s formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA’s formula because it believes it provides a more accurate estimate. “We follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,” the German carmaker said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford and Porsche didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A screengrab from Tesla’s website advertising the Model S sport sedan. Driving range is among the most important factors considered by electric vehicle buyers.
Whatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars’ estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla’s range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPA said it has seen “everything” in its audits of EV manufacturers’ range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers. “That is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market  and why EPA prioritizes” auditing them, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPA cautioned that individuals’ actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pannone called Tesla “the most aggressive” electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m not suggesting they’re cheating,” Pannone said of Tesla. “What they’re doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla’s in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds reported in March 2021. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edmunds has continued to test electric vehicles, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They&amp;#39;ve gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,” Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can “misrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars’ range. It cited tests by the country’s environment ministry that showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company’s claimed ranges in cold weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla’s website, including one that claimed about a particular model: “You can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.” Regulators required Tesla to remove the “or longer” phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging “false/exaggerated advertising.”&lt;/p&gt;

Creating a diversion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By last year, sales of Tesla’s electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team’s operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its “virtual” service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla “Virtual Service Advisor” described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: “Divert customers who do not require in person service.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the Las Vegas “Diversion Team” to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had purchased the metallophone – a xylophone with metal keys – that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office’s operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers’ cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range. Advisors would offer tips on extending range by changing driving habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the remote diagnostics found anything else wrong with the vehicle that was not related to driving range, advisors were instructed not to tell the customer, one of the sources said. Managers told them to close the cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla also updated its phone app so that any customer who complained about range could no longer book service appointments, one of the sources said. Instead, they could request that someone from Tesla contact them. It often took several days before owners were contacted because of the large backlog of range complaints, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla recently stopped owners from using its app to book service appointments relating to complaints about driving range. Instead, it gave them tips on increasing range and directed their inquiries to a “Diversion Team” tasked with preventing service-center visits.
The update routed all U.S. range complaints to the Nevada diversion team, which started in Las Vegas and later moved to the nearby suburb of Henderson. The team was soon fielding up to 2,000 cases a week, which sometimes included multiple complaints from customers frustrated they couldn&amp;#39;t book a service appointment, one of the people said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team was expected to close about 750 cases a week. To accomplish that, office supervisors told advisers to call a customer once and, if there was no answer, to close the case as unresponsive, the source said. When customers did respond, advisers were told to try to complete the call in no more than five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2022, managers aiming to quickly close cases told advisors to stop running remote diagnostic tests on the vehicles of owners who had reported range problems, according to one of the people familiar with the diversion team’s operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thousands of customers were told there is nothing wrong with their car” by advisors who had never run diagnostics, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters could not establish how long the practice continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla recently stopped using its diversion team in Nevada to handle range-related complaints, according to the person familiar with the matter. Virtual service advisors in an office in Utah are now handling range cases, the person said. Reuters could not determine why the change was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signs off on fuel economy and driving range estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPA required Tesla to slightly lower driving range estimates that it planned to put on window stickers for six recent models after the agency’s own testing. But the EPA said such variation is not uncommon in testing by makers of electric vehicles.
On the road&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time Alexandre Ponsin reached California on his March road trip, he had stopped to charge his Model 3’s battery about a dozen times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerned that something was seriously wrong with the car, he had called and texted with several Tesla representatives. One of them booked the first available appointment in Santa Clara – about two weeks away – but advised him to show up at a Tesla service center as soon as he arrived in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ponsin soon received a text saying that remote diagnostics had shown his battery “is in good health.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We would like to cancel your visit for now if you have no other concerns,” the text read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Of course I still have concerns,” Ponsin shot back. “I have 150 miles of range on a full charge!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, he received another text message asking him to cancel the appointment. “I am sorry, but no I do not want to close the service appointment as I do not feel my concerns have been addressed,” he replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undeterred, Ponsin brought his car to the Santa Clara service center without an appointment. A technician there told him the car was fine. “It lasted 10 minutes,” Ponsin said, “and they didn’t even look at the car physically.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing more research into range estimates, he said he ultimately concluded there is nothing wrong with his car. The problem, he said, was that Tesla is overstating its performance. He believes Tesla “should be a lot more explicit about the variation in the range,” especially in very cold weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I do love my Tesla,” the engineer said. “But I have just tempered my expectation of what it can do in certain conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;

A huge chunk of consumer debt still carries fixed rates made before 2022.

In the depths of the pandemic, Alex and Cynthia Durbin refinanced their mortgage at 2.75%. They built up their savings by spending less, then paid off a car loan and student debt.

That meant the family’s balance sheet didn’t take a hit when the Federal Reserve started aggressively raising interest rates last year in an effort to cool inflation. The Fed on Wednesday raised rates to a 22-year high, the 11th increase since March 2022. Though most things cost more now, the Durbins still have room in their budget to dine out with their three young children and go on vacation a few times a year. 

“It’s given us a tremendous amount of breathing room,” Durbin said of his 

Americans locked in ultralow rates on debt such as mortgages and auto loans in the decade-plus that followed the 2008 financial crisis. Though rates on some loans such as credit cards are rising with the Fed’s hikes, a huge chunk of consumer debt carries the low yields on offer a few years ago. That has allowed many households to continue spending, which has kept the economy going strong despite predictions of a recession. 

As of the first quarter, only 11% of outstanding household debt carried rates that fluctuated with benchmark interest rates, according to Moody’s Analytics. That metric has hovered around this historically low level for over a decade. But it only started to matter when the Fed began its campaign. 

Fixed-rate debt became more common after the 2008 crisis, when lenders turned away from products such as adjustable-rate mortgages and home-equity lines of credit that played a role in the bust. Households have also spent the past decade-plus loading up on auto and student loans, which typically carry fixed rates.

Households would have to pay 9.6% of their disposable income to stay current on their debts in the first quarter, according to the Fed. That is above where it was in the depths of the pandemic but below the postcrisis average. 

The prevalence of fixed-rate debt is likely blunting the impact of the central bank’s moves. Economic growth and consumer spending remain mostly solid. One popular gauge suggests that the Fed’s moves are having less of an effect on financial conditions than earlier this year. 

“It’s one reason why consumers are hanging tough and the Fed’s rate hikes have taken less of a bite out of the economy,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. 

Americans who refinanced their mortgages for a better rate since March 2020 have saved $42 billion on their monthly payments, Black Knight estimates. 

Some who nabbed low rates do feel stuck in place: Upgrading to the next home or car is now prohibitively expensive. The national housing market is paralyzed by homeowners who aren’t moving because they don’t want to give up their cheap mortgages. 

Alex Durbin, who is 36 and works in private-wealth management, said his family of five is outgrowing their three-bedroom home in the Columbus, Ohio, area. They bought a plot of land for a new home but, with mortgage rates around 7%, they can’t afford to build the house they want. “We’re in this weird limbo state,” he said. 

Durbin said they could also use a car with more space, but they plan to stick with their paid-off Honda Odyssey minivan with 135,000 miles for now. “I don’t even want to think about what it would cost to finance,” he said. 

Still, the cheap, fixed-rate debt has generally put borrowers in a better financial position. Many bought properties that have already risen in value. Some are also taking advantage of higher rates on savings accounts and Treasurys—making them overall winners in the central bank’s campaign.

Michael and Niki Reznicek weren’t planning on buying a home in 2021. But after the pandemic prompted the Fed to cut rates to near zero and mortgage rates fell, they put their savings toward a down payment on a Chicago townhome. Their mortgage rate was around 3.25%. In today’s market, they wouldn’t be able to buy the same home. 

Their spending has mostly stayed the same. “I still go get my Starbucks, we still go out and tip 20 to 25 percent at restaurants,” said Michael Reznicek, who is 28 and works in financial technology. The couple does look for sale items at the grocery store more frequently, he said.

Gary Marsh, 66, paid cash to build his Sonoma County, Calif., home in 2020 and the following year took out a 2.75% mortgage on the property that provided him with a lump sum of about $300,000. He recently put those funds into certificates of deposit at local banks paying about 4.75%. 

“The low mortgage rate has allowed me to work less, travel more and mostly to feel more free than I ever have,” said Marsh, a writer for real-estate companies.

Meta reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday and said that its Reality Labs unit, which develops virtual reality and augmented reality technologies needed to power the metaverse, logged a $3.7 billion operating loss.

The unit recorded $276 million in second-quarter sales, down from the $339 million in revenue it brought during the first quarter. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were projecting Reality Labs to record $421 million in sales and $3.5 billion in operating losses.

Shares of Meta were up about 5% after it reported an 11% pop in revenue as advertising rebounded and the company issued an uplifting sales forecast for the third quarter. It shows that Meta is still very much an ad company with a big cost center.

Last year, Meta’s Reality Labs unit lost a total of $13.7 billion while bringing in $2.16 billion in revenue, which is driven in part by the company’s sales of Quest-branded VR headsets. Reality Labs lost $3.99 billion during the first quarter. That puts its total losses at about $21.3 billion since the beginning of last year.

Meta said in its earnings report that it expects operating losses in its Reality Labs unit “to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in augmented reality/virtual reality and investments to further scale our ecosystem.”

'They're putting a soft landing back on the table,' one economist says

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate to a range of 5.25%-5.5%. the highest level in 22 years in order to combat ""elevated"" inflation.

With financial markets and economists widely expecting the move, the focus was on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's one-hour session with reporters. Here are the four key takeaways from Powell's presser:

Fed staff is no longer forecasting a recession

During the press conference, Powell made news by saying the Fed staff is now forecasting a ""noticeable slowdown"" rather than a recession. The reason for the shift, Powell said, is that the staff has seen the recent resiliency in the economic data.

Powell said he also thinks the Fed can bring inflation down ""without the kind of really significant downturn.""

Ordinarily, we would have had to wait until Aug. 16, when the Fed releases a summary of its two-day meeting, to get a read on the staff's economic forecast.

""They're putting a soft landing back on the table,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist of PNC Financial Services Group.

Banks are not aggressively tightening lending standards

Ever since Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March, economists have been worried that other banks will pull back on lending and raise loan standards. So far, there has been a steady reduction in lending but no dramatic moves. The Fed keeps an eye on loan standards in quarterly surveys with bank officers.

The latest report is due next week, but Powell gave us a sneak preview, saying that lending conditions are tighter but not in an alarming fashion. ""I would just say it is broadly consistent with what you'd expect. You've got lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter,"" he said.

Powell said credit conditions were a headwind facing the economy.

Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe General, said her team thinks the Fed will not hike rates further, citing tighter lending starts and tighter credit standards as indicating they are done.

Why did Powell refuse to bite about 'one final hike' in September?

In June, the Fed forecast two more 25-basis-point rate hikes this year.

With one taken care of Wednesday, Powell was offered the opportunity to hint that the Fed was leaning toward a final rate hike in September. But he ""steadfastly refused to bite,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America Economist at Capital Economics.

Powell also pushed back on the idea that the Fed is now on an ""every-other-meeting"" hiking schedule, which would imply a final hike at the start of November.

Vince Reinhart, a former top Fed staffer and now chief economist at Dreyfus and Mellon, said he thought Powell is a chair ""behind his committee."" While Powell wants to skip a hike in September, there are too many members of the Fed who are uncomfortable with such a signal, so Powell couldn't say it, he said.

""Powell is comfortable putting a policy-rate move off to November. Some people are less comfortable,"" Reinhart said.

On the other hand, Omair Sharif. the president of Inflation Insights, said it might have been hawkish that Powell never mentioned ""one more hike"" at all.

Sharif said this raised the possibility that there might be more than one hike before the Fed says it is done.

After the meeting, traders in derivatives markets saw only a 40% chance of a rate hike by November.

Powell suggests bar for another hike is high

Powell did show his dovish colors a little bit when he said ""we've covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.""

Fed officials who are pressing for more rate hikes have said they do not expect many more ""effects"" on the economy from previous hikes.

""To the extent that the Fed views policy lags as relatively long, it suggests that they are going to be very careful in trying to avoid overtightening from here,"" said Thomas Simons, an economist at Jefferies.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/202307261107/fed-no-longer-sees-a-recession-and-other-things-we-learned-from-powells-press-conference""&gt;https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/202307261107/fed-no-longer-sees-a-recession-and-other-things-we-learned-from-powells-press-conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;They&amp;#39;re putting a soft landing back on the table,&amp;#39; one economist says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate to a range of 5.25%-5.5%. the highest level in 22 years in order to combat &amp;quot;elevated&amp;quot; inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With financial markets and economists widely expecting the move, the focus was on Fed Chair Jerome Powell&amp;#39;s one-hour session with reporters. Here are the four key takeaways from Powell&amp;#39;s presser:&lt;/p&gt;

We launched PlayStation 5 in November 2020 and the world was in a strange and different place than when we announced the console in 2019. Despite the unprecedented challenges of COVID, our teams and our partners worked diligently to deliver PS5 on time. We continued to face headwinds with the pandemic, and it took months for supply chains to normalize so we could have the inventory to keep up with demand. For more months than I care to remember, we kept thanking our community for their patience while working through these issues. But now PS5 supply is well-stocked and we are seeing that pent up demand finally being met.

With the support of PlayStation fans, we have reached a milestone of 40 million PS5 consoles sold through* to gamers since launch. Thank you so much to our community of gamers – without you this would have been an impossible task.

PS5 launched with the best catalog of games in our history and the momentum for great content keeps getting stronger. From innovative indie games to AAA blockbusters, there are more than 2,500 PS5 games now available, and it has never been a better time to experience PS5 In the last two months alone, we have seen incredible new games from our partners, including Final Fantasy XVI, Diablo IV, and Street Fighter 6.

The U.S. economy showed few signs of recession in the second quarter, as gross domestic product grew at a faster than expected pace during the period, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.

GDP, the sum of all goods and services activity, increased at a 2.4% annualized rate for the April-through-June period, better than the 2% consensus estimate from Dow Jones. GDP rose at a 2% pace in the first quarter.

Markets moved higher following the report, with stocks poised for a positive open and Treasury yields on the rise.

Consumer spending powered the solid quarter, aided by increases in nonresidential fixed investment, government spending and inventory growth.

Perhaps as important, inflation was held in check through the period. The personal consumption expenditures price index increased 2.6%, down from a 4.1% rise in the first quarter and well below the Dow Jones estimate for a gain of 3.2%.

Consumer spending, as gauged by the department’s personal consumption expenditures index, increased 1.6% and accounted for 68% of all economic activity during the quarter.

In the face of persistent calls for a recession, the economy showed surprising resilience despite a series of Federal Reserve interest rate increases that most Wall Street economists and even those at the central bank expect to cause a contraction.

Growth hasn’t posted a negative reading since the second quarter of 2022, when GDP fell at a 0.6% rate. That was the second straight quarter of negative growth, meeting the technical definition of a recession. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research is the official arbiter of expansion and contractions, and few expect it to call the period a recession.

Thursday’s report indicated widespread growth.

Gross private domestic investment increased by 5.7% after tumbling 11.9% in the first quarter. A 10.8% surge in equipment and a 9.7% increase in structures helped power that gain.

Government spending increased 2.6%, including a 2.5% jump in defense expenditures and 3.6% growth at the state and local levels.

Separate reports Thursday brought more positive economic news.

Durable goods orders for items such as vehicles, computers and appliances rose 4.7% in June, much higher than the 1.5% estimate, according to the Commerce Department. Also, weekly jobless claims totaled 221,000, a decline of 7,000 and below the 235,000 estimate.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/gdp-q2-2023-.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/gdp-q2-2023-.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Meta Platforms impressively exceeded expectations in Q2 2023, reporting strong earnings and revenue driven by the success of its AI-powered ad campaign. The company's stock surged 9% in premarket trading, reaching $325.53 ahead of Thursday's market opening. A robust rebound in the digital ad market and advertisers' growing confidence in Meta's AI capabilities contributed to its remarkable quarterly performance.

Looking ahead, Meta issued an optimistic revenue forecast for Q3 2023, anticipating revenues between $32 billion and $34.5 billion. Bernstein analysts described this guidance as a ""monster guidance,"" implying a potential year-over-year growth of at least 15%. Additionally, Meta's short-form video offering, Reels, achieved an impressive annual revenue run rate of over $10 billion in the latest quarter, demonstrating the platform's continued expansion and monetization.

Despite facing losses in its virtual world business division, Meta remains committed to its metaverse vision. CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated the company's dedication to investing in AI and advancing the metaverse concept, considering the two areas as overlapping and complementary.

567,stocks,"While the gaming world fixates on the implications of a Microsoft-Activision deal and AI, a smaller player in their universe may deserve a closer look from investors.Japanese game publisher Capcom Co.’s shares are up by a third this year, outpacing the broader Tokyo market and capping off a remarkable 1,200% surge over the past decade. That’s in part because the $11 billion company has punched well above its weight, spawning Hollywood franchises such as Resident Evil and Monster Hunter. 

The rally means Capcom, which reports earnings Wednesday, is trading at valuations well in excess of many of its biggest rivals from Konami Group Corp. to Bandai Namco Holdings Inc. It’s doing so despite lagging peers in the smartphone gaming arena, which now makes up half the industry’s sales. Of analysts covering the company, 7 rate it a hold and 10 a buy, with one sell.

Capcom is somewhat of an oddity in the $200 billion gaming industry. About 70% of its sales come from games released in the previous fiscal year or earlier, an unusually high proportion for an industry typically driven by new content, art and adventures. That’s helped the Osaka-based firm break the cycle of earnings volatility that depends on big new releases by capitalizing heavily on its back catalog of games, analysts said. 

Tapping underserved and developing markets, such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, with heavily discounted classic games has paid off. The profit margin on a $10 sale of an old game is effectively 100%, as all development costs have already been accounted for in earlier years. 

“Capcom has an extremely high operating profit margin and ROI which you can’t really find elsewhere, even outside Japan,” UBS Securities analyst Kenji Fukuyama said. Its gross margin is consistently better than peers, with last year’s 58.6% mark overshadowing Square Enix Holdings Co. (51.2%), Konami (38.9%) and Bandai Namco (37.2%). 

The firm sells software in 230 countries and regions, by far the largest number among Japanese publishers, according to Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda. It’s set a goal of selling 100 million copies per year, from the 41.7 million mark it set in the fiscal year ended March.

Capcom was early to convert its older console hits into digital downloads for PCs, and that’s helped it realize the lucrative strategy it relies on today, Fukuyama said. It’s also helped smooth out the massive swings in profits that business models relying on a constant flow of major new hits produce, making Capcom an investor darling. 

The stock is now the priciest in its peer group, when comparing enterprise value to earnings, but investors can’t find an off-ramp when growth has been so remarkably consistent, Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc. analyst Junko Yamamura said. The company grew its operating profit for the tenth straight year in March, reporting an 18% rise to ¥50.8 billion ($360 million).

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a much-anticipated interest rate hike that takes benchmark borrowing costs to their highest level in more than 22 years.

In a move that financial markets had completely priced in, the central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee raised its funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 5.25%-5.5%. The midpoint of that target range would be the highest level for the benchmark rate since early 2001.

Markets were watching for signs that the hike could be the last before Fed officials take a break to watch how the previous hikes are impacting economic conditions. While policymakers indicated at the June meeting that two rate hikes are coming this year, markets are pricing in a better-than-even chance that there won’t be any more moves this year.

The post-meeting statement offered only a vague reference to what will guide the FOMC’s future moves.

“The Committee will continue to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy,” the statement said in a line that was added from the previous months’ communication. That echoes a data-dependent approach – as opposed to a set schedule – that virtually all central bank officials have embraced in recent public statements.

 The hike received unanimous approval from voting committee members.

 The only other change of note in the statement was an upgrade of economic growth to “moderate” from “modest” at the June meeting despite expectations for at least a mild recession ahead. The statement again described inflation as “elevated” and job gains as “robust.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/fed-meeting-july-2023-.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/fed-meeting-july-2023-.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services. The other mega-cap tech companies are joining together to help create another option. A group formed by Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, along with TomTom, is releasing data that could enable companies to build their own maps, without having to rely on Google or Apple. The Overture Maps Foundation, which was established late last year, captured 59 million “points of interest,” such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders. The data has been cleaned and formatted so it can be used for free as the base layer for a new map application.

Meta and Microsoft collected and donated the data to Overture, according to Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF. Data on places is often difficult to collect and license, and building map data requires lots of time and staff to gather and clean it, he told CNBC in an interview. “We have some companies that, if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could,” Prioleau said. Rather than spending that kind of money, he said, companies were asking, “Can we just get collaboration around the open base map?” Overture is aiming to establish a baseline for maps data so that companies can use it to build and operate their own maps.

For many companies, Google’s and Apple’s maps aren’t ideal, because they don’t provide access to the underlying data. Instead, those companies allow app makers to use their maps as a service and, in many cases, charge each time the underlying map is accessed. For example, app makers pay per thousand Google Maps lookups through an application programming interface (API). Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, but web app developers need to pay. “That works for a lot of people, but not for others,” Prioleau said.

# [Stock futures slip as investors digest Big Tech earnings and await Fed decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/25/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell slightly Wednesday as investors weighed a batch of corporate earnings from major technology names and geared up for the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures fell slightly, while Nasdaq-100 futures slid 0.1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 60 points, or 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Google-parent Alphabet rose nearly 7% as cloud revenue growth helped propel the company to a better-than-expected quarter. On the other hand, Microsoft slid more than 3% after reporting slowing cloud revenue growth.
*****
&gt; Outside of Big Tech, Snap tumbled 19% after giving weak guidance for current-quarter performance.
*****
&gt; Investors are counting down to the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate policy decision and subsequent news conference with Chair Jerome Powell scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. The market is pricing in around a 98% chance the central bank raises interest rates, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool. That would mark a return to hikes after not increasing interest rates in June.
*****
&gt; “Investors will focus on the post meeting press conference and look for any clues about future policy path,” said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “Commentary from Chair Powell that would indicate more restrictive policy is required to bring inflation under control could dampen recent stock market optimism.”
*****
&gt; Wall Street notched a winning day Tuesday as investors reviewed the latest earnings and made adjustments with the Fed decision on the horizon. After eking out a gain just shy of 0.1%, the Dow clinched its 12th-straight winning session, a streak not seen since for the blue-chip average since February 2017. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite finished about 0.3% and 0.6% higher, respectively.
*****
&gt; Beyond the interest rate decision, investors will continue following the latest corporate financial releases on Wednesday. Coca-Cola, Stellantis, Boeing and AT&amp;T are among companies expected to report before the bell, while Meta, Chipotle and Mattel’s earnings are slated to drop after the market closes.

*NEW ALBANY, Ohio—A $7.95 bottle of Bath &amp; Body Works foaming hand soap used to take three months to put together. The pieces had to travel more than 13,000 miles from China, Canada and Virginia to the company’s Ohio distribution center.*

*Bath &amp; Body Works decided it needed to get new products to market more quickly. The result was a production initiative with little parallel in corporate America.*

*Now every step of production occurs at plants just feet from each other on the company’s dedicated “beauty park” on the outskirts of Columbus. One factory makes the foaming pump and mechanism. Another makes the bottle itself, a third makes the label, a fourth makes the soap, fills the bottle, attaches the label and screws on the top. A fifth packages it. Getting a bottle to distribution is down to 21 days and a few miles. A majority of Bath &amp; Body Works products, which are sold in its own stores, are made on site.*


--------------------------


The effort, which started in 2008, required a lot of negotiation with sometimes skeptical suppliers. The campus includes 10 manufacturers and millions of square feet of production and warehouse spaces, with 5,000 employees working there during peak production. Bath &amp; Body Works had sales of $7.56 billion last year, increasing annual revenue by more than $2 billion since 2019.

“I look at BBW as a composer and a conductor of a symphony,” said Bath &amp; Body Works supply-chain executive Susanna Zhu. 

Bringing production closer to home, often called “reshoring,” has become a priority for many companies. Disruptions from Covid-19, severe weather, trade wars, geopolitical tensions and stuck ships left consumers without the couches and hot tubs they wanted. The Biden administration is spending hundreds of billions of dollars aimed at boosting the domestic presence of industries deemed strategic, including electric cars, batteries and semiconductors.

The government money, along with roaring consumer demand and persistent supply-chain issues, are leading to a factory building boom, with spending at its highest level in at least 20 years. Over the next decade, public and private investment will amount to $3.5 trillion, the government estimates.

Bath &amp; Body Works’ initiative proved particularly helpful during the pandemic. While competitors struggled with shortages, BBW’s suppliers on location shared raw materials and even employees to make more hand sanitizer and other in-demand goods.

Chief Executive Gina Boswell said locating corporate executives just a short drive away from key manufacturers allows problems to be fixed and new products developed quickly. 

“That’s magical, especially when you need speed and agility,” she said.

The company, which like many retailers benefited from increased consumer spending in the pandemic, said sales could fall this year. 

One challenge to replicating BBW’s model is that factories don’t operate in bubbles, but rely on networks of suppliers, parts and expertise—and moving those networks is costly. Once such a network has been established, it tends to get stuck there. 

Land, labor and compliance with environmental and zoning laws also generally cost more in the U.S. than in China and developing countries.

What works for soap and the two dozen other products BBW makes won’t necessarily translate to smartphones, blenders or even backpacks with highly specialized supply chains deeply rooted in Asia. 

Semiconductor manufacturers and raw steel producers require massive upfront investment and economies of scale. The BBW model is better suited to exploiting economies of scope, in which a manufacturer produces a variety of products. Bath &amp; Body Works can roll out around 7,000 new scented products a year.

BBW, whose headquarters is about 10 miles from the beauty park, was founded by Les Wexner as part of his retail conglomerate, L Brands. The body-products seller grew from 27 stores in 1990 to more than 1,000 in 1999 and 1,810 as of April. In 2021 L Brands spun off its Victoria’s Secret lingerie stores and changed its name to Bath &amp; Body Works, focusing exclusively on that brand. 

For its beauty campus, the company chose New Albany, a planned community close to a major highway and a day’s drive from nearly half the country’s population. 

New Albany wanted to diversify its white-collar economy. To entice BBW, the city created zoning and installed infrastructure at a cost of $6 million to itself and $3 million from the state. The early factories opened on the 450-acre site in 2011.

To make it happen, BBW had to persuade its best suppliers to move. The plus for suppliers was continuing to do business with a fast-growing skin-care seller—with volume guarantees from BBW for a set number of years. The minus: spending millions to relocate production and buy new equipment. 

Rieke Packaging, which makes dispensing pumps for soap bottles, didn’t know if it was going to be worth the investment. At the time, Rieke made the pump at factories in China. Rieke had an existing factory a few hours away in Indiana that could potentially supply the park, but Bath &amp; Body Works said it wanted factories on-site. 

“From a supplier perspective, there was a lot of resistance,” said Craig Miller, who worked for Rieke at the time and now works in supply chain and manufacturing for a pharmaceutical company. “You want us to buy more equipment. Our lease rate is going to be double what it’s going to be in rural Indiana. Come on, that doesn’t sound any fun.” 

Rieke decided to make the several-million dollar investment in New Albany. “It was too big of an opportunity to pass up,” Miller said.  

Moving production to Ohio wasn’t easy. Factories had to contend with planning officials, high labor and construction costs and even endangered bats.

Jeff Stouffer worked for Bath &amp; Body Works in new product launches and later joined a supplier that made perfumes and filled bottles, which opened up a new factory at the campus around 2015. He and other executives met with city and business park officials more than a dozen times to discuss the aesthetics of the relatively small factory, negotiating over everything from the color of the walls to the size of the company’s sign. It was like a homeowners’ association on steroids, he said. 

“They are very rigid about what it looks like,” he said.

The possible presence of a species of endangered bats prevented the removal of trees on the site, delaying construction for several months.

Still, almost every company has expanded beyond their initial investment.

“It’s going to be a 2- to 3-year heavy lift for a payout in 5 to 10 years from now,” Stouffer said. 

Keeping costs down was the biggest challenge. 

Not every production step took place in Ohio at first. Rieke initially molded two outer plastic parts in New Albany, which could be made from any number of colors. It would then attach them to the inner core of the pump, which was still made in China.

Around 2020, Bath &amp; Body Works said it really wanted the entire foaming soap pump to be produced in the U.S. BBW also didn’t want to pay more than the approximately 20 to 25 cents per unit it was paying, according to Will Nguyen, an engineer who then worked for Rieke and now works as a consulting engineer. 

The two sides negotiated a multiyear supplier agreement to bring pump engine production to the campus from China. For a few months, it wasn’t clear if that would happen, said Nguyen. 

Rieke agreed to make the entire pump in Ohio at essentially the same unit cost, and Bath &amp; Body Works helped Rieke get access to volume guarantees and global purchasing and supplier deals with other companies, said Nguyen. 

Now Rieke had to figure out how to make the pumps in Ohio—profitably. They turned to automation. 

In China, building the 13-part pump was a manual process using lots of workers who handled tiny springs and balls. “We cannot replicate the manual process that was done overseas in central Ohio,” said Mark Box, an executive of TriMas Packaging, the parent of Rieke—but getting machines to replicate that work was complicated. “You’ve got very small parts, moving very quickly. The slightest thing can cause a jam.” 

The machines had to make a pump tight enough to keep the liquid inside but not so tight that it won’t operate. The machines also had to deal with differences in plastics and other raw materials from shipment to shipment. 

Nguyen estimates that production in the U.S. employs around 10 people and required $12 million in capital investment, versus employing around 50 people with under $2 million in investment for similar production capacity in China. 

The automation and proximity means that pumps and their parts can arrive and be fully created in under a month, compared with five months previously. Rieke sells around 300 million pumps to Bath &amp; Body Works a year.

New Albany thinks the beauty campus can be a model for other companies and communities. It has attracted an Amgen pharmaceutical plant. Last year Intel chose New Albany as the site of a $20 billion semiconductor facility. The company said the Intel plant would attract dozens of new local suppliers, including semiconductor equipment makers and other materials providers.

The success of the park, and its thousands of employees during the peak season, means that some of the closely located manufacturers are worried about labor shortages. Bath &amp; Body Works has recently allowed some suppliers to open up factories in other parts of Ohio to attract new workers. 

BBW’s strategy today revolves around the unique properties of its beauty park: new products, delivered quickly. Bath &amp; Body Works regularly rolls out fresh aromas and places a premium on fast design and production. This model allows BBW to charge premium prices and avoid discounts and leftovers, and helps cover the added cost of local manufacturing. 

The Wild Sand aroma (fragrance notes: prickly pear fruit, cactus flower and warm agave nectar), launched earlier this month, is available as a hand soap, candle, shower gel, perfume, sanitizer spray, body lotion and self tanner. 

Unlike most retailers, which preorder all of their products for the season months in advance, Bath &amp; Body Works aims to preorder around two-thirds. It then closely monitors sales and places additional “instant” orders for winning products. 

“Within literally a week, that’s what’s getting shipped,” said Nicholas Whitley, chief executive at soap maker and filler KDC/One. 

Being co-located means manufacturers can use a campus shipping service to easily send samples to the next stage in the process or to a Bath &amp; Body Works executive for signoff, no overnight shipping required. How something smells, feels or looks in a store is hard to relay over Zoom calls. 

“There are glitters, holographics that don’t translate as well,” said Tom DeCicco, a graphics manager at label maker CCL Label. “You can’t get that in the picture.”

&lt;p&gt;For its beauty campus, the company chose New Albany, a planned community close to a major highway and a day’s drive from nearly half the country’s population. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Albany wanted to diversify its white-collar economy. To entice BBW, the city created zoning and installed infrastructure at a cost of $6 million to itself and $3 million from the state. The early factories opened on the 450-acre site in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it happen, BBW had to persuade its best suppliers to move. The plus for suppliers was continuing to do business with a fast-growing skin-care seller—with volume guarantees from BBW for a set number of years. The minus: spending millions to relocate production and buy new equipment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rieke Packaging, which makes dispensing pumps for soap bottles, didn’t know if it was going to be worth the investment. At the time, Rieke made the pump at factories in China. Rieke had an existing factory a few hours away in Indiana that could potentially supply the park, but Bath &amp;amp; Body Works said it wanted factories on-site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“From a supplier perspective, there was a lot of resistance,” said Craig Miller, who worked for Rieke at the time and now works in supply chain and manufacturing for a pharmaceutical company. “You want us to buy more equipment. Our lease rate is going to be double what it’s going to be in rural Indiana. Come on, that doesn’t sound any fun.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rieke decided to make the several-million dollar investment in New Albany. “It was too big of an opportunity to pass up,” Miller said.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving production to Ohio wasn’t easy. Factories had to contend with planning officials, high labor and construction costs and even endangered bats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff Stouffer worked for Bath &amp;amp; Body Works in new product launches and later joined a supplier that made perfumes and filled bottles, which opened up a new factory at the campus around 2015. He and other executives met with city and business park officials more than a dozen times to discuss the aesthetics of the relatively small factory, negotiating over everything from the color of the walls to the size of the company’s sign. It was like a homeowners’ association on steroids, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They are very rigid about what it looks like,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possible presence of a species of endangered bats prevented the removal of trees on the site, delaying construction for several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, almost every company has expanded beyond their initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to be a 2- to 3-year heavy lift for a payout in 5 to 10 years from now,” Stouffer said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping costs down was the biggest challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every production step took place in Ohio at first. Rieke initially molded two outer plastic parts in New Albany, which could be made from any number of colors. It would then attach them to the inner core of the pump, which was still made in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 2020, Bath &amp;amp; Body Works said it really wanted the entire foaming soap pump to be produced in the U.S. BBW also didn’t want to pay more than the approximately 20 to 25 cents per unit it was paying, according to Will Nguyen, an engineer who then worked for Rieke and now works as a consulting engineer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two sides negotiated a multiyear supplier agreement to bring pump engine production to the campus from China. For a few months, it wasn’t clear if that would happen, said Nguyen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rieke agreed to make the entire pump in Ohio at essentially the same unit cost, and Bath &amp;amp; Body Works helped Rieke get access to volume guarantees and global purchasing and supplier deals with other companies, said Nguyen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Rieke had to figure out how to make the pumps in Ohio—profitably. They turned to automation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In China, building the 13-part pump was a manual process using lots of workers who handled tiny springs and balls. “We cannot replicate the manual process that was done overseas in central Ohio,” said Mark Box, an executive of TriMas Packaging, the parent of Rieke—but getting machines to replicate that work was complicated. “You’ve got very small parts, moving very quickly. The slightest thing can cause a jam.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The machines had to make a pump tight enough to keep the liquid inside but not so tight that it won’t operate. The machines also had to deal with differences in plastics and other raw materials from shipment to shipment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nguyen estimates that production in the U.S. employs around 10 people and required $12 million in capital investment, versus employing around 50 people with under $2 million in investment for similar production capacity in China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The automation and proximity means that pumps and their parts can arrive and be fully created in under a month, compared with five months previously. Rieke sells around 300 million pumps to Bath &amp;amp; Body Works a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Albany thinks the beauty campus can be a model for other companies and communities. It has attracted an Amgen pharmaceutical plant. Last year Intel chose New Albany as the site of a $20 billion semiconductor facility. The company said the Intel plant would attract dozens of new local suppliers, including semiconductor equipment makers and other materials providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of the park, and its thousands of employees during the peak season, means that some of the closely located manufacturers are worried about labor shortages. Bath &amp;amp; Body Works has recently allowed some suppliers to open up factories in other parts of Ohio to attract new workers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BBW’s strategy today revolves around the unique properties of its beauty park: new products, delivered quickly. Bath &amp;amp; Body Works regularly rolls out fresh aromas and places a premium on fast design and production. This model allows BBW to charge premium prices and avoid discounts and leftovers, and helps cover the added cost of local manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wild Sand aroma (fragrance notes: prickly pear fruit, cactus flower and warm agave nectar), launched earlier this month, is available as a hand soap, candle, shower gel, perfume, sanitizer spray, body lotion and self tanner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most retailers, which preorder all of their products for the season months in advance, Bath &amp;amp; Body Works aims to preorder around two-thirds. It then closely monitors sales and places additional “instant” orders for winning products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Within literally a week, that’s what’s getting shipped,” said Nicholas Whitley, chief executive at soap maker and filler KDC/One. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being co-located means manufacturers can use a campus shipping service to easily send samples to the next stage in the process or to a Bath &amp;amp; Body Works executive for signoff, no overnight shipping required. How something smells, feels or looks in a store is hard to relay over Zoom calls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are glitters, holographics that don’t translate as well,” said Tom DeCicco, a graphics manager at label maker CCL Label. “You can’t get that in the picture.”&lt;/p&gt;

585,stocks,"The Federal Trade Commission is finalizing its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, four people with knowledge of the matter told POLITICO, a move that could ultimately break up parts of the company.

The FTC has been investigating the company on a number of fronts, and the coming case would be one of the most aggressive and high-profile moves in the Biden administration’s rocky effort to tame the power of tech giants. The wide-ranging lawsuit is expected as soon as August, and will likely challenge a host of Amazon’s business practices, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter. If successful, it could lead to a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire and define the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.

Khan rose to prominence as a Big Tech skeptic with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in. Because any case will likely take years to wind through the courts, the final result will rest with her successors.
The exact details of the final lawsuit are not known, and changes to the final complaint are expected until the eleventh hour. But personnel throughout the agency, including Khan herself, have homed in on several of Amazon’s business practices, said some of the people.

The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services, according to some of the people.

The agency has been drafting a complaint since at least the end of last year, some of the people said, and is likely to file its case in federal court rather than its in-house tribunal.

In its probe, the FTC has interviewed dozens of witnesses both inside and outside Amazon, including CEO Andy Jassy and former CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, some of the people said. The FTC has collected millions of documents from Amazon and third parties over the last three years to build its case.

590,stocks,"Microsoft reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Here are the key numbers to follow:

Earnings: $2.69 a share. That may not compare with the $2.55 cents per share expected by Refinitiv.

Revenue:  $56.19 billion. That may not compare with the $55.47 billion expected by Refinitiv.

Based on analysts’ projections, Microsoft will close fiscal 2023 with revenue growth below 10% for the first time since 2017. Growth for the latest quarter is expected to come in at around 7%. Businesses have been delaying cloud and software deployments since last year due to economic uncertainty and the potential for higher interest rates.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in May that the company won’t lift salaries this year.

Analysts polled by CNBC and by StreetAccount expect Microsoft to report about 25% year-over-year growth in revenue from the Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Microsoft doesn’t report Azure revenue in dollars. The projected growth rate is similar to what analysts expect from Google’s cloud division. Parent company Alphabet also reports results after the bell on Tuesday.

During the quarter, Microsoft built on its broad alliance with OpenAI to capitalize on fresh interest in artificial intelligence, following the November launch of the startup’s ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft introduced a chatbot powered partly by OpenAI language models to help workers make sense of their employers’ data, and it told developers they’ll be able to build plugins that people can access through ChatGPT, the Bing search engine’s chatbot, and other tools.

Investors are eager for resolution in Microsoft’s arrangement to buy Activision Blizzard for almost $69 billion, which was agreed upon in January 2022. Earlier this month, an appeals court denied the Federal Trade Commission’s motion to stop the transaction. Activision shares have climbed past $92.50, close to the $95 that Microsoft agreed to pay, reflecting optimism that the deal is on track to close.

Microsoft shares have gained 44% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 19%.

In June, Microsoft said it expected to take a $425 million charge in the quarter to pay a fine from Ireland’s Data Protection Commission after the authority looked at whether the company’s LinkedIn unit violated the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.

Executives will discuss the quarterly results with analysts and issue guidance on a conference call starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

&lt;p&gt;Here are the key numbers to follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings: $2.69 a share. That may not compare with the $2.55 cents per share expected by Refinitiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue:  $56.19 billion. That may not compare with the $55.47 billion expected by Refinitiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on analysts’ projections, Microsoft will close fiscal 2023 with revenue growth below 10% for the first time since 2017. Growth for the latest quarter is expected to come in at around 7%. Businesses have been delaying cloud and software deployments since last year due to economic uncertainty and the potential for higher interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in May that the company won’t lift salaries this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts polled by CNBC and by StreetAccount expect Microsoft to report about 25% year-over-year growth in revenue from the Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Microsoft doesn’t report Azure revenue in dollars. The projected growth rate is similar to what analysts expect from Google’s cloud division. Parent company Alphabet also reports results after the bell on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the quarter, Microsoft built on its broad alliance with OpenAI to capitalize on fresh interest in artificial intelligence, following the November launch of the startup’s ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft introduced a chatbot powered partly by OpenAI language models to help workers make sense of their employers’ data, and it told developers they’ll be able to build plugins that people can access through ChatGPT, the Bing search engine’s chatbot, and other tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are eager for resolution in Microsoft’s arrangement to buy Activision Blizzard for almost $69 billion, which was agreed upon in January 2022. Earlier this month, an appeals court denied the Federal Trade Commission’s motion to stop the transaction. Activision shares have climbed past $92.50, close to the $95 that Microsoft agreed to pay, reflecting optimism that the deal is on track to close.&lt;/p&gt;

the things present in almost every major bubble and burst are:

1) bias . ignoring risk.

2) overzealousness . oversizing your position.

3) complacency. e.g markets always go up.

All of these are becoming more prevalent today...mainly the ETFs.

If youre going to go all in in the SPY, make sure you know the real reason - youre betting on the US economy to beat out the rest. thats it.

past performance is not an indicator of the future...

lastly, the only way you profit is by selling to someone higher. even with dividends, this is from profits which requires inflow of cash from outside the market.

Back in high school, when I was about 15, I started getting into money and investing. Somehow, I managed to save up around $7,000 USD by investing mostly in TSLA and doing a bit of trading. Then, out of the blue, I struck gold with GME when it was only $3. You remember the GME rollercoaster, right? My portfolio went ballistic and hit $100,000 USD at the peak of $500! But here's where things went haywire – I had no clue when to bail out, and man, I lost a big chunk of my profits.

602,stocks,"I’m in my early 20’s in college and devout about 70% of my paycheck into 5 stocks, like the title says: TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, and APPL.

Why does this feel like a both good and bad long term strategy of investing? On one side, I can’t see these stocks going anywhere, tech only will expand, and even if tech stocks crash, these stocks seem to be able to extend beyond just “tech”, ie TSLA with cars, AMZN with grocery stores, APPL with, well, phones and computers, Microsoft seemingly expanding to being a company that branches far past tech, and even Google even though operation as a search engine seems to have and will continue to cement themselves as a leading corporation in America.

Of course, I’m not saying anything special. I’m just wondering, is this a foolish plan? I know diversification is important, but it seems just dumping as much as I can in these stocks for the next 20 years is a solid investment strategy that should enable me to become financially free and eligible for retirement by 40.

It’s honestly nice not having to research new companies and hope my research pans out. Just dumping my money in these already established companies and believing that they’re going to be even bigger and more importantly still around and operating in profit in 20 years makes my investment strategy feel easy and relaxing. Yet, is it supposed to feel this easy? 

Thoughts?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m in my early 20’s in college and devout about 70% of my paycheck into 5 stocks, like the title says: TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, and APPL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this feel like a both good and bad long term strategy of investing? On one side, I can’t see these stocks going anywhere, tech only will expand, and even if tech stocks crash, these stocks seem to be able to extend beyond just “tech”, ie TSLA with cars, AMZN with grocery stores, APPL with, well, phones and computers, Microsoft seemingly expanding to being a company that branches far past tech, and even Google even though operation as a search engine seems to have and will continue to cement themselves as a leading corporation in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I’m not saying anything special. I’m just wondering, is this a foolish plan? I know diversification is important, but it seems just dumping as much as I can in these stocks for the next 20 years is a solid investment strategy that should enable me to become financially free and eligible for retirement by 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s honestly nice not having to research new companies and hope my research pans out. Just dumping my money in these already established companies and believing that they’re going to be even bigger and more importantly still around and operating in profit in 20 years makes my investment strategy feel easy and relaxing.

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were little changed Tuesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered its longest winning streak since February 2017.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures inched down by 18 points. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 advanced by 0.1%, and Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.4%.
*****
&gt; The Dow on Monday rose more than 183 points, or 0.5%, marking its 11th consecutive winning session. The 30-stock index also hit its highest level since April 2022 and had its highest close since February 2022. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively.
*****
&gt; While a stronger-than-expected earnings season has helped maintain the market rally, Wall Street is also carefully awaiting the Federal Reserve’s policy decision on Wednesday. Fed fund futures data shows a 98% probability of a quarter-point hike, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Investors are waiting for Chair Jerome Powell’s statements on his outlook for the economy as it tackles inflation.
*****
&gt; “Clearly, the market has a significant amount of momentum. … But we think the fundamental backdrop is still quite negative. Stocks are not bound by any sort of fundamentals,” Eric Johnston, Cantor Fitzgerald’s head of equity derivatives and cross asset, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “We think that the economic risk and the earnings risk [are] one-sided. Meaning that if everything remains okay, then what you see right now – which is sort of subdued, but steady growth — would remain. But we think the risk is really the downside for economic growth,” Johnston added.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

&lt;p&gt;The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;priced in&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security&amp;#39;s price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.&lt;/p&gt;

Hey there, I wanted to share my thoughts on DHI, a stock I recently invested in. I bought around 100 shares at $117, and today it reached an all-time high of $130. Now, I'm torn between taking profits or holding onto it. I'd love to hear your insights and opinions on this.

Reasons for My Investment:

One of the primary reasons I invested in DHI is the ongoing housing shortage, with about 5 million Americans in need of homes. Despite high-interest rates on mortgages, I believe some millennials are willing to ""get used to"" these rates in order to own a home. Additionally, there's speculation about the Federal Reserve potentially lowering interest rates, though it's been indicated that only one interest rate cut is expected for the entire year (source: The Kobeissi Letter).

Furthermore, DHI's recent Q3 earnings report was impressive, with EPS beating by almost 38% and revenue surpassing estimates by 15.61%. This suggests the company is performing well and could continue to grow.

Concerns to Consider:

While I'm bullish on DHI, there are some concerns to consider. Hedge fund owners have sold off around 2.6 million shares from January to May. While this might not be alarming, it's worth investigating their reasons behind the sell-off.

Average Price Target:

The average price target for DHI is $142, as per the analysts' consensus. While this is positive, we should remember that price targets are speculative and can change based on new information and market conditions.

Some quick glances at their finances show that they performs well -- well, well enough for its small size and compared against the negative fundamentals of its peers (Lynas, other Australian rare earth producers, and against Canadian rare earth producers) and against other SPACs. For example, it has had a strong growth of its revenue (up 82% in 2020, 147% in 2021, and 58% in 2022), gross profit (up 563% in 2020, 278% in 2021, 69% in 2022), and a decent growth in net profits (down -223% in 2020, up 718% in 2021, and up 114% in 2022); furthermore, EPS has grown from -.27 in 2020 to 1.52 in 2022.

I believe they have a large market-share of US rare earth oxides market as well. Now here are some problems/questions I want to ask you all (more specifically those of you who are either invested in MP or other REO producing companies or track such markets) :

(*BTW I know that MP doesn't produce REO, but rather that they produce the concentrate which they send to Chinese companies to be refined).*

1. How competitive is MP compared to Chinese producers of REO? Does it have a chance against taking a large share from Chinese producers?
2. What are its weaknesses? I know that one of them is the short term volatile price fluctuations of REO. Besides that, do you think the demand and growth projections for REO will be realized or are they severely overestimating them? Adding on to that since REO are commodities, and currently people are saying there is a shortage of them and will continue to be, at current production, a shortage of them in the future, the price of these REOs should increase, but how long until supply meets demand and equilibrium is reached? Because after that MP strategy, since its in the commodity sphere, should just be efficiency in production to reduce costs, right?
3. What do you think about their management? The CEO seems, form the interviews I have watched of him, focused on the idea of establishing a US  REO market, but other views from him regarding the business (except the need for REO, the high demand for them, etc.) I haven't heard much about. What about the other management? -- What do you all think of them?

Finally, I would appreciate any thoughts on MP Materials -- even if you hate them, like them, think they are doomed, etc. etc. I just want to get others opinions and thoughts on this company.

616,stocks,"NIO reported a 74% increase in deliveries month over month for June and also recaptured the significant 10,000 delivery mark. Additionally, retail sales of new energy vehicles increased 10% month over month last month, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), suggesting that Chinese electric vehicle start-ups may be entering the second half of the year with significantly stronger delivery and sales momentum than the first. Due to the growing demand for new energy vehicles as well as the introduction of new products like the ET5 Touring, which diversifies the company's sedan product line, NIO may be poised for ongoing delivery growth.  
With the delivery of 10,707 electric automobiles to its clients in June, NIO performed admirably. The firm delivered more than 10,000 electric vehicles in June for the first time since March, and NIO reached the second-highest monthly delivery total in FY 2023, trailing only February's 12,157 electric car deliveries. NIO experienced growth of 74% month over month, which was also the quickest M/M growth rate the EV manufacturer has witnessed this year.  
The decline in car margins, which presents a profitability issue for both the EV company and the larger sector, is the largest risk for NIO. Because of increased pricing pressure and fiercer market rivalry (as EV companies diversify their product lines to provide customers more options), vehicle margins are declining. If NIO started to experience negative vehicle margins, as XPeng did in the first quarter, that is what would make me rethink my opinion of the firm.  
From an operational perspective, NIO has also recently recorded some very respectable successes: NIO reported its second-highest monthly delivery volume of FY 2023 (only behind February) and regained the significant 10,000 EV delivery threshold in June for the first time since March. Although NIO didn't do as well as Li Auto, which for the first time ever exceeded the threshold of 30,000 EV vehicles, NIO still performed well in June with a 74% M/M rise in deliveries as well as a comeback (15%) in sedan deliveries.

Due to the growing demand for new energy vehicles as well as the introduction of new products like the ET5 Touring, which diversifies the company&amp;#39;s sedan product line, NIO may be poised for ongoing delivery growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the delivery of 10,707 electric automobiles to its clients in June, NIO performed admirably. The firm delivered more than 10,000 electric vehicles in June for the first time since March, and NIO reached the second-highest monthly delivery total in FY 2023, trailing only February&amp;#39;s 12,157 electric car deliveries. NIO experienced growth of 74% month over month, which was also the quickest M/M growth rate the EV manufacturer has witnessed this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline in car margins, which presents a profitability issue for both the EV company and the larger sector, is the largest risk for NIO. Because of increased pricing pressure and fiercer market rivalry (as EV companies diversify their product lines to provide customers more options), vehicle margins are declining. If NIO started to experience negative vehicle margins, as XPeng did in the first quarter, that is what would make me rethink my opinion of the firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an operational perspective, NIO has also recently recorded some very respectable successes: NIO reported its second-highest monthly delivery volume of FY 2023 (only behind February) and regained the significant 10,000 EV delivery threshold in June for the first time since March. Although NIO didn&amp;#39;t do as well as Li Auto, which for the first time ever exceeded the threshold of 30,000 EV vehicles, NIO still performed well in June with a 74% M/M rise in deliveries as well as a comeback (15%) in sedan deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

618,stocks,"Hi all, happy Monday! I'm seeking to diversify my portfolio and also wanted to break up the SPY, QQQ, NVDA, MSFT chains that always seem to develop here with a company that is less discussed. Ericsson (ticker ERIC) is a communication infrastructure company based in Stockholm currently trading at $5.12 per share at market close. I've been reading up on the company and its expected performance and it seems somewhat positive. 

There are 3 factors that seem to be the primary considerations (this includes my takeaways from the articles, and is not purely fact):

1. Earnings Strength - While the EPS has decreased from $0.73 to an estimated $0.48 over the past year or so, analyst forecasts have been raised after the company beat their expected Q1 earnings by $0.06. 
2. Relative Valuation - The consensus across all the reports I've read are evenly split between a neutral rating on valuation or a positive one. Generally speaking, its current valuation is not quite where it should be, with the general expectation being that it should be valued at $1-$2 higher. 
3. Price Movement - This is one of the strongest indicators that has drawn my attention. The YTD price of the stock has dropped by 32.4%, with a 1-quarter down of 5.1%. The 1-month decline has slowed even more to 3.3%. There is a mix of conclusions here, either the value is bottoming out and will start to climb, or will lead to average price performance over the next few months. 

In my opinion, ERIC seems to be a reasonable, undervalued stock that could prove to be a good short-term holding. What are your thoughts? (I'm still pretty new to investing in general, so constructive feedback on the way I've analyzed this would be greatly appreciated!)

630,stocks,"Some analysis from my site of new and innovative companies, which received massive media attention and hype in the last years. But after hype is gone, many of these stocks has significantly fallen in their prices, especially those that went public in the last two to three years. Nevertheless, in my opinios we have some hidden gems here, which may be worth a look at right now:

**Bumble: A Bumpy Ride for the Dating App Giant**

Bumble, a well-known dating app with additional features, has experienced a significant 77% decline in its stock since its IPO. While its revenue growth has been solid but not outstanding, with a 16% increase in the last quarter, the company's profitability has seen a slight decline but has shown signs of improvement. With a market capitalization of $2.3 billion and a price-to-sales ratio of around 2.5, the current valuation appears attractive, presenting a potential buying opportunity after the initial hype during the IPO was considered unjustified. Investors may find Bumble worth a second look given the current lack of interest in the stock.

**Rivian: The ""Tesla Killer"" Faces Tough Competition**

Rivien, known as the ""Tesla Killer,"" has gathered significant media attention for its electric vehicles, especially pickup trucks and SUVs with unique headlights. Despite the initial hype, the stock has plummeted by 88% since its IPO. Ford and Amazon were major investors, but the relationship with Amazon soured, leading Rivien to terminate its exclusive supply contract.

As a young company, Rivien's latest quarterly numbers show impressive revenue growth of 600%, primarily due to minimal revenue in the previous year. The company is now delivering significant quantities of cars, totaling 8,000 in the current quarter, and aims to achieve a gross profit in 2024 while targeting over 50,000 vehicle deliveries in 2023. With a cash cushion of nearly $12 billion, Rivien's market capitalization stands at $14.2 billion.

Considering the current revenue growth, Rivien's value seems attractive, but it's crucial to acknowledge the uncertainty surrounding its future. The revenue-to-sales ratio is not representative at this stage. Investors who believe in Rivien as a serious automaker may find the company's valuation worthy of respect. However, the stock remains speculative due to ongoing uncertainties and market speculation.

**Didi: The Struggles of a Ride-Hailing Giant in China**

Didi, a ride-hailing company with food delivery services, has experienced an 80% decline in stock value since its IPO. Revenue growth has been inconsistent due to COVID-19 impact and regulatory challenges in China. Despite a recent data scandal and a $1.2 billion fine, Didi's market capitalization is $14.5 billion, less than one times its revenue of $19 billion. A potential China comeback may make the stock appealing, but it carries increased risk.

**Marqeta: A Hidden Gem in the Fintech Industry**

Marqeta, a fintech company serving the B2B sector with payment and card solutions, has seen an 84% decline in stock value since its IPO. Revenue growth has been impressive, with a 31% increase in the last quarter, leading to improved profitability. Currently, Marqeta's market capitalization stands at $2.6 billion, with revenue reaching $800 million, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of approximately 3.3. Considering the strong 30% growth, the current valuation appears exciting and remarkably inexpensive. However, the stock was evidently overvalued at its IPO, given its current financial performance.

**Palantir: The Profitability Puzzle**

Palantir, a well-known data analysis software firm, has seen a 66% increase in its stock since IPO, achieving near profitability in the last two quarters. While revenue growth was solid at 18%, the market capitalization stands at $33 billion, 17 times its revenue of $2 billion. This valuation is deemed very high, considering moderate profitability and an 18% growth rate.

**Coupang: The South Korean Amazon**

Coupang, a dominant player in South Korea's 24-hour delivery and e-commerce market, has seen a 60% decline in stock value since IPO. Despite stable growth and a 20% currency-adjusted growth rate in the latest quarter, profitability has surged by 36%, with a positive EBITDA of $241 million. With a market capitalization of $31 billion and revenue of $21 billion, the stock's current valuation is just 1.5 times its revenue, making it an attractive deal. Considering a potential strong comeback in South Korea, the stock deserves a second look.

**Snowflake: A Hyped Cloud-Based Software Service**

Snowflake, a cloud-based software service company, is shaping the market and expects exponential growth. Despite a 25% decline since IPO, its latest quarterly numbers were strong, with a 47% revenue increase and positive earnings per share. The net revenue retention remains high at 151%, but a downward trend is evident. With a market capitalization of $55 billion and revenue of $2.2 billion, the stock's current valuation is 25 times its revenue, considered astronomically high. The hype surrounding Snowflake's partnerships with Microsoft and Nvidia attracts investors, but caution is advised as market interest may eventually calm down.

**Coinbase: Riding the Cr\*ptocurrency Rollercoaster**

Coinbase, a cryptocurrency platform, experienced a significant decline since its IPO, currently standing at -76% from the offering price. The decreasing interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, has impacted Coinbase's trading volume and revenue, which almost halved since the beginning of 2022. Despite managing to improve profitability, Coinbase still operates at a negative margin. The current market capitalization is $17 billion with revenue of $2.8 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of over 6, which isn't considered cheap. As the market largely depends on the price of B\*tcoin and cr\*pto trading volume, Coinbase is viewed as a speculative investment, and direct investment in Bitcoin might yield better results, especially during downward phases.

**GitLab: A Promising Business Model**

GitLab, a DevOps platform solution, has experienced a decline of 56% since its IPO. Despite this, the company's business development has been promising, with pleasing revenue and profitability trends. GitLab follows a software-as-a-service subscription model, charging per user per month. The current market capitalization is $7 billion with revenue of $460 million, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of approximately 15. While the numbers are good, the high valuation may not be fully justified yet. However, the positive business trajectory indicates potential for further stock growth.

**DoorDash: Strong Growth with Uncertain Profitability**

DoorDash, a food delivery service, has experienced a decline of 56% since its IPO. Despite this, the company has shown strong revenue growth, averaging around 40% in recent quarters, and provided a slight surprise in earnings per share. The current market capitalization is $29 billion with revenue of $7.1 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 4. However, DoorDash is yet to achieve profitability, and the path to break-even remains unclear. Although restaurant food prices have increased by around 25%, DoorDash still faces challenges in reaching profitability. As such, investors may be cautious until a clear path to profitability emerges.

**Roblox: Targeting a Young Audience**

Roblox, an online game platform targeting a young audience, has seen a 42% decline in its stock since its IPO. Revenue growth has been stagnant, influenced by pandemic effects, and losses have significantly widened, reaching approximately $270 million per quarter. Despite this, Roblox has a high market valuation of $23 billion with revenue of $2.3 billion, resulting in a stock price ten times higher than its revenue. This valuation is considered expensive, especially considering the increased losses and minimal growth, as the company relies on the purchasing power of parents of its young target audience. As a result, investors may view Roblox as a risky investment at its current valuation.

**UiPath: Robotics in Process Automation**

UiPath, a company specializing in robotic process automation (RPA), has seen a significant decline of nearly 74% in its stock since its IPO. However, its revenue has almost doubled since going public, and the retention rate remains high at 22%. The latest quarterly numbers were positive, with growth and earnings per share surpassing expectations. Currently, UiPath's market capitalization is just under $10 billion with revenue of $1.1 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 8.6, which is not considered cheap. UiPath faces competition from other players like Microsoft in the RPA and process automation space, which adds to the competitive landscape. While the company's financial performance shows promise, investors may be cautious about its valuation and the competitive challenges it faces.

**Toast: A Savory Deal for Restaurant Operators**

Toast, a specialized software solution for the restaurant sector, has experienced a decline of -60% in its stock value since its IPO. However, the company's financials show positive signs. It has achieved steady growth with a robust 53% revenue increase in the first quarter of 2023. The revenue sources include hardware sales, subscription model fees, and other channels for restaurant operators. Toast's profitability has also improved significantly, with the negative adjusted EBITDA nearly halving in recent quarters. Currently, the stock has a market capitalization of $11 billion with revenue of $3 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 4, which is considered an attractive valuation given the current growth rate. The company's ingenious business model that covers various aspects of the restaurant business makes it promising for potential investors despite its recent stock decline.

**Affirm: Stagnation in the ""Buy Now, Pay Later"" Space**

Affirm, a fintech company providing ""buy now, pay later"" solutions to online retailers, has experienced a 57% decline in its stock value since its mid-2021 IPO. The company's revenue has remained relatively stagnant in recent quarters, with no significant growth. Similar trends are observed with competitors like Mollie, Afterpay, and Zip, indicating a stagnant market. Due to the lack of growth and increasing profits, the current valuation is deemed too expensive, and the stock does not present many investment opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

In conclusion, this analysis highlights the rollercoaster ride of IPO hype, with some stocks failing to fullfill the expectations, while others offer hidden gems potential. For me personaly: Toast and Coupang stand out as promising stocks with strong financials. Let me know your thoughts on this summary and your personal ""hidden gems"".

Currently, UiPath&amp;#39;s market capitalization is just under $10 billion with revenue of $1.1 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 8.6, which is not considered cheap. UiPath faces competition from other players like Microsoft in the RPA and process automation space, which adds to the competitive landscape. While the company&amp;#39;s financial performance shows promise, investors may be cautious about its valuation and the competitive challenges it faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toast: A Savory Deal for Restaurant Operators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toast, a specialized software solution for the restaurant sector, has experienced a decline of -60% in its stock value since its IPO. However, the company&amp;#39;s financials show positive signs. It has achieved steady growth with a robust 53% revenue increase in the first quarter of 2023. The revenue sources include hardware sales, subscription model fees, and other channels for restaurant operators. Toast&amp;#39;s profitability has also improved significantly, with the negative adjusted EBITDA nearly halving in recent quarters. Currently, the stock has a market capitalization of $11 billion with revenue of $3 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 4, which is considered an attractive valuation given the current growth rate. The company&amp;#39;s ingenious business model that covers various aspects of the restaurant business makes it promising for potential investors despite its recent stock decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affirm: Stagnation in the &amp;quot;Buy Now, Pay Later&amp;quot; Space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affirm, a fintech company providing &amp;quot;buy now, pay later&amp;quot; solutions to online retailers, has experienced a 57% decline in its stock value since its mid-2021 IPO. The company&amp;#39;s revenue has remained relatively stagnant in recent quarters, with no significant growth. Similar trends are observed with competitors like Mollie, Afterpay, and Zip, indicating a stagnant market. Due to the lack of growth and increasing profits, the current valuation is deemed too expensive, and the stock does not present many investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this analysis highlights the rollercoaster ride of IPO hype, with some stocks failing to fullfill the expectations, while others offer hidden gems potential.

637,stocks,"I looked into Carvana, again, and I am surprised by the way the management is communicating key information.

**Disclaimer: I have no exposure to Carvana, and never had.**

The post will be divided into the following segments:

* Misleading investors
* Painting a rosy picture with window dressing
* The trouble ahead

&amp;#x200B;

**Misleading investors**

As Carvana is an eCommerce platform for buying/selling used cars, the revenue, as well as, the gross profit per unit are both important to keep track of.

The company has 3 different revenue sources:

* Retail Sales
* Wholesale Sales
* Other (Sales of financing loans and commissions)

I'd like to point to the Gross profit per unit (**""GPU""**). It doesn't take a high level of education to calculate this, right?

Here are the numbers from the last quarter:

* Gross profit: $499 million
* Retail vehicle unit sales: 76,530
* Wholesale vehicle unit sales: 46,453

If you did the math correctly, you'd get slightly above $4k gross profit per unit.

Carvana reports **a GPU of $6,520.** You might wonder how? Where does it go wrong? Well, the explanation is simple. They divide the total gross profit with **only the retail vehicle unit sales**.

This makes absolutely no sense! Not only that, it is being communicated everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

**Painting a rosy picture with window dressing**

It is not uncommon for companies to use accounting tricks to show somewhat better results. I'd like to point to Carvana's free cash flow for the first half of 2023. Based on the cash flow statement,

Cash from operations **$443 million**

Capex: **$50 million**

Free cash flow **$393 million**

This is not bad for a company that is not profitable, so one might wonder how can this be the case.

No, the explanation does not lie in share-based compensation.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take a look at a simple example - **A lemonade stand**:

Imagine you own a lemonade stand and on the 31st of December 2022, you’ve spent $1,000 to buy all the raw materials needed (lemons, sugar, etc.)Then, in the new year, you’ve sold all of this for $950. Yes, you lost money as the business is not profitable. However, during 2023, you brought in $950 in cash from operations!

Now you have a lemonade stand with no inventories, as you did not buy more lemons and sugar. This is clearly not sustainable. If you did restock and spent $1,000 again, the cash from operations would have been -$50 (matching the profitability of the business).

&amp;#x200B;

Let's go back to Carvana. During these 6 months, Carvana reduced its inventory by $564 million. So, the company now holds less inventory than it had before.  All companies of this kind, need to restock. Therefore, if Carvana restocked, the free cash flow would have been negative $171 million.I think credit should be given for reducing inventory, but the $393 million of reported free cash flow should not be used as a guide for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**The trouble ahead**

The most common method of buying a car is using a car loan (based on Statista, 84% of the cars in the US are financed). That means the total cost of the car is the sum of:

* The purchase price of the car, and;
* The interest on a car loan

&amp;#x200B;

With rising interest rates, there are two scenarios that could happen:

Scenario 1: The prices of the cars remain the same, leading to higher total costs, which will lead to lower demand

Scenario 2: The prices of the cars will drop due to the lower demand, which will lead to similar total costs. From an economic point of view, it is likely to experience scenario 1, followed by scenario 2.

In both scenarios, Carvana is exposed to a tough environment.

The company is still unprofitable, it has $8.5 billion in debt (including leases), and roughly $0.5 billion in cash. In my opinion, regardless of the refinancing, the company is headed for bankruptcy. Could I be wrong? Of course.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked into Carvana, again, and I am surprised by the way the management is communicating key information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The purchase price of the car, and;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interest on a car loan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With rising interest rates, there are two scenarios that could happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario 1: The prices of the cars remain the same, leading to higher total costs, which will lead to lower demand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario 2: The prices of the cars will drop due to the lower demand, which will lead to similar total costs. From an economic point of view, it is likely to experience scenario 1, followed by scenario 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both scenarios, Carvana is exposed to a tough environment.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the weekend, moviegoers turned out in force for Greta Gerwig’s neon-coated fantasy comedy “Barbie,” which smashed expectations with $155 million to land the biggest debut of the year. But they also showed up to see Christopher Nolan’s R-rated historical drama “Oppenheimer,” which collected a remarkable $80.5 million in its opening weekend.

Apparently this is view shared by a lot of people in the industry. I like that kind of brand loyalty.

The company serves more than just the plumbing market. Their products are also used in HVAC, railroads, and other industrial cases. I think this is an interesting play on near shoring and reindustrialization in the US. CSW products will be used in factories, as well as in home repair and construction.

The company was a spin off in 2014. They also have a bout a 5% insider ownership rate, which is impressive. They credit a lot of this to their employee stock purchase plan which helps employees build equity in the company. Basically, they want employees to benefit from the company doing well, as this creates more incentive for the employees to perform at a high level.

CSWI pays a small dividend (0.44%) which it started in 2019 and has increased every year except 2020. It tries to allocate capital in 2 ways to grow the company. First, is to develop new products. CSW has a long history of quality and works with its customers to develop products they need. They also grow through acquisition. They completed 2 acquisitions in 2022, both completed through cash transactions, not shareholder dilution.

Mine safety disclosures: none.

644,stocks,"Tesla Inc. has started offering consumers 84-month auto loans after Elon Musk said the carmaker would “have to do something” about rising interest rates. The company now includes seven-year loans as an option on its US order pages, after previously offering loans as long as 72 months. While extending loan terms can lower car buyers’ monthly payments, consumers tend to pay more in interest and face greater risk of owing more than their vehicle is worth.

Tesla’s chief executive officer has been a frequent critic of the Federal Reserve. Musk tweeted in November that the central bank’s rate increases were “massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.” His predictions of impending deflation haven’t yet panned out.“When interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car, because the interest payments increase the price of the car,” Musk said during Tesla’s July 19 earnings call. “So we have to do something about that.”

While 84-month auto loans have been gaining in popularity, the trend slowed early this year, according to credit-reporting company Experian. Roughly 34% of new vehicles loans in the first quarter were longer than six years, down from about 38% a year ago. Tesla delivered a record 466,140 vehicles during the three months that ended in June but has sold fewer cars than it’s produced each of the last five quarters. The shares plunged after Musk said on this week’s call that the company will have to keep lowering prices if interest rates continue to rise.

648,stocks,"This is more of a question post than my own due diligence.

Companies like Carvana and Transocean have provided monster returns for investors willing to buy in the “dead period” when nobody cares/company looks like it will go bankrupt. I do think LUMN is 1) trying to bottom and 2) very volatile but a long term chart zoomed out is starting to look kinda flat even with huge up and down days

In my view, LUMN is saddled with such extreme debt that it could be a deep value play IF they are able to hold on and not go bankrupt. Maybe they can go 5-10x like Carvana or RIG.

From what I gather, management seems to have a long term plan that includes asset sales to pay off big chunks of debt, buying back shares (idk if that is a good idea if they are distressed: see Bed Bath and Beyond), later investing a big chunk of capex in a couple years to expand the business, and hopefully roll over the debt. 

So IMO this is a rates play but I haven’t done enough homework. Bonds seem priced for bankruptcy and maybe that is an awesome way to play the recovery but I bought a handful of shares since it recovered post lead cable FUD (possible capitulation event) with a massive green day and added a few otm call options as far out as I could. I think this isn’t something I would bet big on but it could be a stock where you turn nothing (a very small amount of your money, like .1-.3% of your portfolio) into something (2-3%) if it works out. And sometimes things can work out quite fast. I remember reading about RIG on WSB at the bottom when it was $.80/share and I thought about buying LEAPs and seeing what happened. I didn’t bc too many people said they were going bankrupt and there was too much dilution. Little did I know that in distressed asset investing, it DOES NOT matter if you get diluted to hell. Risk of going to zero trumps that by a lot. If LUMN can also buy back shares along the way, that would be even more impressive, but seems risky to throw away money at reducing the float if you go bankrupt. Additionally, if they sell a bunch of assets, wouldn’t that potentially massively decrease cash flow?

Any thoughts on LUMN timeframes, execution risk, and expectations if it works out? How long would this take for the market to not believe they are going bankrupt?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is more of a question post than my own due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

I think this isn’t something I would bet big on but it could be a stock where you turn nothing (a very small amount of your money, like .1-.3% of your portfolio) into something (2-3%) if it works out. And sometimes things can work out quite fast. I remember reading about RIG on WSB at the bottom when it was $.80/share and I thought about buying LEAPs and seeing what happened. I didn’t bc too many people said they were going bankrupt and there was too much dilution. Little did I know that in distressed asset investing, it DOES NOT matter if you get diluted to hell. Risk of going to zero trumps that by a lot. If LUMN can also buy back shares along the way, that would be even more impressive, but seems risky to throw away money at reducing the float if you go bankrupt. Additionally, if they sell a bunch of assets, wouldn’t that potentially massively decrease cash flow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts on LUMN timeframes, execution risk, and expectations if it works out? How long would this take for the market to not believe they are going bankrupt?&lt;/p&gt;

649,stocks,"Hi guys,   


Im learning a little bit about how the stock market works in a exchange, and i understood the following:  


At the beginning of the day there is an auction at the exchange(before the market starts), people can give their bids and asks, and there is an algorithm at the exchange system to match this, in order to maximize the number of trades. It defines the opening price of the asset, and after that the market operates normally(bids, asks and trades), and at the end of the day there is another auction to define the close price(at the same way as at the morning).  
Now saying about corporate actions, i've always used corporate actions to correct prices in the past, but how it works when a corporate action is paid, in the exchange level? in a split for example, the exchange that correct the prices at the auction? or the people their bids and asks at the auction? How does it works for someone (in a brokerage) that sent a order in a day before the split?(the brokerage will correct its offer?, the offer is cancelled?  


Thanks in advance!

At the all time lows last year, it seemed like the market was pricing in the near 100% probability of a recession 

We all know the market has skyrocketed since January of this year. In the past 6 to 7 months the narrative has flipped. If the market continues to pump towards all time highs the market will soon price in the 100% probability that a recession WON’T happen.

Historically, with everything that happened since the pandemic, there should have been a severe economic downturn. We’re kidding ourselves that this time is the exception. 

What happened is that the media, YouTubers, and influencers were spreading fear for nearly two years that a recession was imminent. Recession fears were in the public’s mind so long that it affected consumer behavior, so there was a lot of cash on the sidelines. Companies preemptively spent over a year getting their balance sheets in order, tech companies especially had a lot of lay offs in 2022.  All of this ensured that a severe recession was not going to happen, or at least not on time. 

When everyone expects a recession it’s not going to happen 

The worst, most severe recessions in history were the ones not enough people saw coming 

What’s going to happen is as markets pump to all time highs, and when the media starts assuring people that the recession was cancelled, people are going to let their guard down and the greed will blind them to the risks. When not enough people are anticipating the recession anymore, that’s when the recession comes and wipes us all out.

&lt;p&gt;Talent/Stock - If an engineer at intel got 200k in rsus after 4 years they would be worth $183,784. At nvidia 200k in rsus would be worth $2.1 million. Why would anyone want to work at intel? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capex: heavy cap ex requirements will keep pressure on margins&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition: Intel faces stiff completion from AMD and NVIDIA when it comes to CPU applications. They are also missing out as the large datacenter customers develop their own custom silicon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GPU - shit show at first when intel rolled out their cards. So many bugs and just terrible performance but looks like driver issues are being addressed an they are already past AMD and closing in on NVIDIA when it comes to their up sampling technology. I&amp;#39;m not very bullish on their GPUs because they had over a decade of experience for iGPU. It remains to be seen if intel GPPU/XPU products will be adopted by the large data center customers. Gamers are a much smaller slice of teh GPU supply now.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile Eye: Probably intel&amp;#39;s best decision in their 20 years as a company but they are so desperate for cash they are going to spin them off in an ipo&lt;/p&gt;

663,stocks,"With regionals and banks declaring earnings this week I think they're looking pretty good. What happened in March with SVB and whatnot, in my opinion, is looking more and more like mania coupled with a some idiosyncratic band management practices at a couple banks mainly SVB. Curious if anybody has any plays or insight they want to share.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking pretty heavily at Western Alliance Preferred Shares (WAL.PRA). WAL was beat when rumors came out that it along with PACW were looking for significant asset shares that caused those two stocks to drop significantly. WAL came out and denied it and it appears it may have been a short run attempt, but either way WAL stock price still not all the way back. 

WAL declared earnings this week and they're looking pretty good. Not only did they gain $3 billion dollars in deposits this quarter, going from about $47 billion to $50 billlion, but they've also indicated thye've had an additional $2 billion increase in deposits to date which would bring them up to $52 billion or so and, importantly, **above where they were last year in deposits.** Meaning not only was the flow-out not that bad, but they're actually starting to grow deposits above where they were before all the bank-runs happened this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, for real estate exposure, they have about $9 billion in CRE loans relative to about $50 billion in loans total, and only $2.3 billion of the CRE is in specifically office space and only 3% of that is in central business districts. They've focused more on suburban office space. Additionally, they're median Loan-To-Value ratio  is about 58% meaning that if they building they gave CRE loans on dropped 40% in value, the bank's equity would still be protected and the bank would not take a hit (this is building specific but on a median overall level this should be true). Thus, their is significant downside protection before the bank's equity starts having to take a hit on the CRE they provided loans on. Accordingly, overall, it looks like they're pretty protected and outside or an apocalyptic type event - as oppose to CRE taking a 30% to 40% hit - WAL should be alright. 

&amp;#x200B;

Their net interest income is also positive at about 3.4% and they expect it to start going up now with rates stabilizing and whatnot.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, overall I think WAL is looking pretty attractive. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I think is an interesting play though is there preferred stock. It's a fixed rate, value of $25 that when issued in 2021 was set at 4.25% payment. But, it resets every 5 years to the 5 year treasury rate plus 3.45%. The first reset date is 2026. Because treasury rates are high - meaning the 4.25% current payout has to normalize to current treasury rates plus a risk premium for the preferred not being a treasury - the preferred stock is currently trading at about $15.70 a share, an about 7% yield.

&amp;#x200B;

But, when the rate resets in 2026 to market rate/the stock derisks as more time goes on assuming there isn't a 2008 type fallout, then the base price should trend back up to $25 a share. And, if you buy now while it's a $15.70 and the rate resets in 2026 to likely a 6.5% yield or higher (if treasuries are 4% then the rate would reset to 7.45%), not only will the preffered stock value apprecaite back up to $25 a share but you would then be getting likely a 10% to 12% yearly dividend yield on what you bought it for. 

&amp;#x200B;

Curious people's thoughts on this, or other play's they are looking at.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary: WAL.PRA currently trading at $15.70 with a 7% yield. The stock should appreciate to $25 by 2026 if everything goes smoothly and the yield rate will reset in 2026 to likely a 6.5% yield or higher. Thus, buying now you could be looking at getting a 7% yield while you wait for a 66% capital appreciation in the stock from $15.70 to $25 over the next couple of years; and, at that point, not only would you have 66% capital appreciation but when the rate resets you would likely be getting a 10% to 12% yearly dividend yield on what you invest.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 24th, 2023.

# **Dow ekes out narrow gain Friday for 10th straight positive day, longest rally since 2017: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks were mixed Friday as traders assessed the latest corporate earnings results, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average stretched its winning streak to 10 sessions.
*****
&gt; The 30-stock Dow climbed 2.51 points, or 0.01%, to close at 35,227.69. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.03% to end at 4,536.34, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.22% to finish the session at 14,032.81.
*****
&gt; The Dow narrowly notched its tenth straight day of gains, a feat not seen for the index since August 2017.
*****
&gt; On a weekly basis, the S&amp;P 500 added 0.69%, while the Dow gained 2.08%. It was the second positive week in a row for the two indexes. The Nasdaq fell 0.57% for the period.
*****
&gt; Trading was volatile Friday as portfolio managers recalibrated their funds to account for an unusual Nasdaq-100 rebalance taking effect Monday. A large volume of index and stock options also expired Friday.
*****
&gt; Traders were still eyeing more corporate earnings after a busy week of quarterly results. Transportation giant CSX fell 3.7% on the back of underwhelming results. American Express, meanwhile, dropped nearly 3.9%.
*****
&gt; Corporate earnings have been mixed thus far. Seventy-five percent of S&amp;P 500 companies that have already reported have exceeded analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet data. However, that beat rate is below a three-year average of 80%, according to The Earnings Scout.
*****
&gt; ″...Overall, early Q2 results appear good enough for equity markets to grind higher for now,” Barclays analyst Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Friday note. “Next week will be more indicative of the broad earnings dynamics, with ~50% of market cap reporting.”

&gt; # It’s a Bird. It’s A Plane! It’s … the US Economy!

&gt; We just got a bunch of data to round out the economic picture in the second quarter (Q2).

&gt; Long story short: Not only do we see no sign of recession, but it also doesn’t even look like the economy is looking for a “landing” at this point.

&gt; I realize this could change, but so far the data doesn’t indicate much weakness. Now, the monthly data can be volatile, and subject to revisions. So it helps to look at the last three months. Let’s walk through some of the highlights.

&gt; # Consumption Was Strong

&gt; * Retail sales rose at a 4.7% annual pace in Q2.

&gt; * Core retail sales, excluding categories like vehicle and gas station sales, rose at a 6.3% annual pace.

&gt; * Even after adjusting for inflation, “real” retail sales rose at a 1.9% annual pace in Q2, and are currently running 6% above the pre-crisis trend!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-20-real-retail-sales-1203x1600.png))**

&gt; # The Supply Side Is Coming Back

&gt; * Vehicle production rose 7.6% in Q2.

&gt; * Production within the aerospace industry rose 4.7% in Q2.

&gt; * High-tech industries are running hot, with production up 3.9%, and almost 17% above pre-pandemic levels.

&gt; * Production of business equipment outside of vehicles and high-tech also looks to have bottomed, which is a positive sign for capex.

&gt; * Single-family housing permits and starts rose 11% in Q2.

&gt; * An index measuring homebuilder sentiment continues to move higher, indicating that builders are getting more positive about future demand.

&gt; * Meanwhile, total housing units under construction (single-family and multi-family) are near an all-time record.

&gt; * Combine that with a boom in manufacturing construction, and its not a surprise why construction payrolls have increased by 88,000 this year and are about 339,000 above pre-pandemic levels.

&gt; # All These Points to Strong Economic Growth

&gt; The Atlanta Fed puts out a “nowcast” of quarterly real GDP growth that is updated with major economic data releases. Right now, it says the economy grew 2.4% in Q2, after adjusting for inflation.

&gt; If that is close to actual GDP growth in Q2, it would mean the economy grew 2.6% over the past year. That is not only stronger than the average 2.3% pace of growth between 2010 and 2019, but it also matches the pace of growth over the three years prior to the pandemic (2017-2019), when economic growth picked up.

&gt; What is amazing is that the economy accelerated after a poor first half of 2022 even as the Federal Reserve hiked rates aggressively, taking the federal funds rate from 0.25% to 5.25%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-20-real-gdp-growth-projected-1206x1600.png))**

&gt; Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.6% over the past year, and headline inflation fell from 9% to 3%.

&gt; It really doesn’t get better than that. Perhaps more importantly, there is no reason to believe a major slowdown is in the cards at this point.

&gt; # Seasonal Bump Absent in Claims Data

&gt; Among the many economic indicators updated this morning, seasonally adjusted initial jobless claims came in stronger than expected, falling to 228K. That reversed the recent jump in claims observed throughout the late spring.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072023-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; Looking at the non-seasonally adjusted data helps to explain the recent decline in the adjusted number. As shown below, barring the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, claims remain at one of the higher readings for the current week of the year in recent history. Typically, in late June and early July, seasonal headwinds cause a significant bump in claims. This year, that increase has been relatively modest.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072023-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Pivoting to continuing claims, the indicator had been on the decline since early April, but the first two weeks of July have seen a modest turn higher. At those levels, continuing claims remain in the middle of the range from the few years leading up to the pandemic.

&gt; # Bulls Dominate

&gt; The past week has provided some positive developments on the inflation front that in turn sent equities higher. In response, readings on investor sentiment have shown a dramatic positive turn. The latest AAII survey showed more than half of respondents reported as bullish for the first time since April 22, 2021. As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, this week's reading ended an over two-year-long streak without a reading above 50% which was the third longest such streak on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072023-AAII-Bullish-sentiment.png))**

&gt; Given the elevated reading of bullish sentiment, a minor share of respondents are reporting as bearish. In fact, that reading fell to 21.5% this week which is the lowest reading since June 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072023-AAII-Bearishsentiment.png))**

&gt; Last year saw a record streak of weeks where bearish sentiment outnumbered bullish sentiment. With the total reversal in sentiment, the bull-bear spread now heavily favors bulls. The spread reached 29.9% this week for the highest reading since April 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072023-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; The gains to bullish sentiment have not entirely come from bears. Neutral sentiment is also reaching new lows, registering just 27.1% this week. Unlike bearish sentiment, that is only the lowest level since the last week of 2022.

&gt; In tonight's Closer we will discuss the surge in other sentiment indicators and what that has historically meant for S&amp;P 500 performance.

&gt; # DJIA Advances for 8th Straight Day – Historically Bullish for Next 3 Months

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/646ff2a11a4a705724163ead66ed70d6/2fe5ab035e3861fd-b4/s500x750/2cf29a7ed0b4a7661967f45524f61e07137e7ab8.jpg))**

&gt; For the 54th time since 1950, DJIA has recorded a daily winning streak of at least eight days. This is DJIA’s first 8-day winning streak since 2019. During the current streak DJIA has advanced 3.93%. Of the prior 53 daily winning streaks lasting eight or more trading days, 26 ended at 8 days, 14 ended at 9 days, 8 made it to 10 days, while 2 made it to 11 and 12 days. DJIA’s longest daily winning streak of 13 days was in January 1987. DJIA also enjoyed an 8-day winning streak in July 1987. Based upon the last 53 streaks, there is only a modest 50.9% chance of the current streak continuing to 9 days or longer.

&gt; Historically, daily winning streaks of 8-trading days or more have been bullish even after they ended. Over the 1-, 2-week, 1-, and 3-month periods after the daily winning streak ended DJIA was higher, 98.1%, 98.1%, 96.2% and 90.6% respectively. The only significant decline within 3 months of a daily streak end was a 19.22% loss in 1987.

&gt; # Reality Check for Housing Starts

&gt; After a blockbuster report for May where Housing Starts and Building Permits both surged, there was a bit of a reality check in June. While Building Permits were expected to come in at 1.50 million, the actual reading came in at 1.44 million representing a 3.7% m/m decline and a drop of 15.3% y/y. One positive of this report, though, was that single-family units actually increased 2.2% and are only down 2.7% y/y even as multi-family units plunged 12.8% m/m and over 30% y/y. With respect to Housing Starts, the headline reading also missed estimates by 46K (1.434 mln vs 1.480 mln). Not only did June's reading miss forecasts, but May's reading was revised lower, so that the originally reported 231K beat was more like 159K. Even after that downward revision, though, Housing Starts declined 8.0% m/m and 8.1% y/y.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071923-Table.png))**

&gt; Following May's report, we noted that the 12-month moving average of Housing Starts had broken its streak of 12 straight declines, but this month, the moving average resumed its downtrend and fell to its lowest level since February 2021. Similarly, the 12-month moving average for Building Permits declined below 1.49 million for the first time since December 2020 and posted its 11th straight decline.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071923-12-Month-average-Shorter-term.png))**

&gt; Taking a longer-term look at the 12-month moving average for Housing Starts, it remains in its well-established downtrend. As shown in the chart below, prior periods where this average peaked and started to rollover usually preceded recessions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071923-12-Month-average.png))**

&gt; A comparison of Housing Starts versus the performance of homebuilder stocks is a perfect example of how the market tends to trade in advance of events. Just as homebuilder stocks peaked four months ahead of the peak in Housing Starts, they bottomed five months in advance of the recent low in the three-month moving average.

&gt; # Homebuilders Hopeful

&gt; Housing activity has been somewhat muted given a dearth of inventories, but the lack of available existing supply has been positive for homebuilders. The NAHB's monthly survey of homebuilder sentiment moved higher in July for its seventh straight monthly gain. Even after the rebound, the current level of 56 represents just a 13-month high and is below the range of readings from the few years prior to the pandemic and historic readings in two years before the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071823-NAHB-1.png))**

&gt; The improvement in the headline index was primarily driven by increases in present sales and traffic. Geographically, the Midwest and South saw some modest softening in sentiment whereas the West and Northeast were much more impressive. The Northeast in particular saw an 8-point jump which ranks in the top decile of all monthly moves on record and brings the index into the top quartile of historical readings.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071823-NAHB-2.png))**

&gt; Although homebuilder sentiment has been rebounding solidly, it pales in comparison to the strength of homebuilder stocks. Proxied by the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB), homebuilders have continued to set new 52-week highs on a near-daily basis. The ETF has now risen 56% over the past year and has continuously traded in overbought territory (currently extremely overbought with a price more than 2 standard deviations above its 50-DMA).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071823-NAHB-3.png))**

&gt; Homebuilder earnings are also on deck in the next couple of weeks. Below, we show a screenshot from the Earnings Explorer function of our Custom Portfolios. As shown, all but three S&amp;P 1500 Homebuilders are due to report through the first week of August. Of those, a vast majority have averaged positive moves on earnings.

&gt; # The Dollar is Weakening – Why That’s Good for US Investors

&gt; At the beginning of the year, we wrote in our 2023 Outlook that the US dollar was poised to weaken, creating tailwinds for Americans who invest in International stocks and S&amp;P 500 earnings. We reiterated that this is starting to happen in our Mid-Year Outlook, “Edging Closer to Normal.”

&gt; The chart below shows the recent swing in the ICE US Dollar Index, which measures changes in the US dollar against a basket of other currencies, including the euro, yen, British pound, and the Canadian dollar. It rose 27% between May ’21 and September ’22, but has pulled back 12% since then.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-US-dollar-index-600x800.png))**

&gt; # A Boost for USD-Based International Equity Investors

&gt; When an investor in the US uses dollars to buy a basket of international stocks, the interim step is first converting those dollars to the local currency, which introduces currency risk. Note that when you see quotes for international stock exchanges, like the Nikkei (Japan) or the DAX (Germany), those are in local currency terms. To buy European stocks, you must first convert dollars to euros. Your returns are not just dependent on what the European stocks do; it’s also dependent on what happens to the euro relative to the dollar. If the euro appreciates against the dollar, that’s a tailwind to your investment, whereas a stronger dollar acts as a headwind.

&gt; From September 30th of last year through July 14th, the MSCI EAFE Index, which represents a basket of international stocks across developed markets, outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index. The MSCI EAFE Index gained 35.2% versus 27.4% for the S&amp;P 500. But as you can see from the table below, that outperformance is because of a tailwind from a weaker dollar. Emerging market stocks have also seen a tailwind from a weaker dollar but have underperformed due to a murky economic picture in China.

&gt; Even over the past month and half (May 31st through July 14th), the dollar took a renewed plunge, boosting returns for international stocks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-USD-and-local-currency-returns-for-indices.png))**

&gt; # A Tailwind for Earnings

&gt; Over the last two decades, movements in the US dollar have negatively correlated with S&amp;P 500 earnings changes. Excluding recessions and post-recession recoveries (since those skew the numbers significantly in either direction), earnings weakness for the S&amp;P 500 has coincided with dollar strength, whereas a weaker US dollar has correlated with stronger earnings growth.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-USD-vs-earnings-585x800.png))**

&gt; This makes some intuitive sense once you realize that 40% of S&amp;P 500 revenue comes from outside the US. The logic here is that if a company used to sell a machine abroad that generated the equivalent of $1,000 in the past, now that would be about $1,100 because the local currency rose 10% against the US dollar.

&gt; So, while the US economy is very relevant for S&amp;P 500 company earnings, much of it also hinges on what happens outside the US and what happens with the US dollar.

&gt;  # Why Is the Dollar Weakening?

&gt; It probably helps to understand why the dollar strengthened in the first place. The simplest explanation is that interest rate differentials between the US and other countries rose – the idea is that if interest rates are much higher in country A rather than country B, money will flow into country A, thus raising the value of that country’s currency.

&gt; The chart below shows the dollar index on the top panel, while the bottom panel shows the difference between 1-year US treasury yields and EU government 1-year yields. You can see how the dollar has moved higher when interest rate differentials climb, most notably after 2014 and in 2022. In contrast, the dollar has pulled back when the differential falls, which is what happened in 2019-2020 and this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-USD-vs-rate-differentials-601x800.png))**

&gt; Short-term interest rates, like 1-year yields, are an estimate of central bank target rates over the next year. 1-year yields in the US surged in 2022 because the Federal Reserve (Fed) raised rates to tame inflation. They were much more aggressive than their counterparts at the European Central Bank (ECB).

&gt; You can see the difference between the Fed and ECB’s target interest rates below. The differential jumped in 2022 but it’s been pulling back recently. The Fed’s taken its foot off the gas, while the ECB remains aggressive. Since the beginning of the year, the Fed has raised rates by 0.75%-points, whereas the ECB has raised it by 1.5%-points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-central-bank-target-rate-differentials-600x800.png))**

&gt; The reason is that US inflation has started to pull back, and is poised to fall further – see our blog from last week discussing this. In contrast, European inflation has remained stubbornly high, which has kept the ECB much more hawkish. In fact, core inflation (excluding volatile components like food and energy) is currently running at 6.8% year-over-year in the Eurozone. That compares to a 4.9% core CPI reading in the US. Up until September 2022, core inflation in the US was running higher than Eurozone core inflation – and then things switched, which shifted investor expectations and sent the dollar lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-core-inflation-US-vs-EU-800x609.png))**

&gt; We expect this dynamic to continue as US inflation eases further, while Europe deals with higher inflation and a more hawkish central bank. Tighter policy does create some headwinds for European equities, but that’s offset by a stronger currency. Combine this with the tailwind that a weaker dollar creates for S&amp;P 500 company earnings, and we are keeping our overweight to US equities while maintaining International developed market stocks at neutral. Emerging markets remain at underweight.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500's Best and Worst Performers During a Monster Week

&gt; After weaker-than-expected inflation data inflated the prices of just about every financial asset, there were some very big winners by the end of last week. The table below lists the 20 top-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 last week, which includes eight stocks that rallied more than 10%. Double-digit gains are typically considered very good for an entire year, so when large-cap stocks move that much in a week, it's impressive. Topping the list, shares of Match (MTCH) gained nearly 14% followed by DR Horton (DHI), Domino's (DPZ), and MGM Resorts (MGM). Among these four top performers and the other stocks listed, it is a somewhat eclectic group of stocks. One well-represented group on the list is the homebuilders. Along with DHI, Lennar (LEN) and Pulte (PHM) both also made the list. In terms of YTD returns, though, last week's biggest winners weren't solely the ones that have been rallying all along or the losers playing catch up; there was actually a little bit of everything. Three of the stocks listed (Etsy, Newell, and Sealed Air) are still down by double-digit percentages YTD while four (Pulte, Align, salesforce, and Monolithic Power) are up over 50%! Besides those extreme movers, there are also a few stocks that merely had single-digit YTD percentage gains before last week's spikes higher. One thing that just about all of these stocks have in common now, though, is that they headed into this week at short-term overbought levels of a varying degree.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071723-Best.png))**

&gt; In total, there were just 88 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that declined last week, and only 53 of those fell more than 1%. Of those 53 stocks, the table below lists the 20 worst performers which all fell more than 3%. This is also an eclectic group in terms of both their lines of business and their YTD performance heading into the week. The only stock down by double-digit percentages was Progressive (PGR) which now makes it down on the year as well. Right behind PGR, shares of Carnival (CCL) fell 9.5%, but unlike PGR, it's still up by over 100% YTD. Besides CCL, two other cruise operators (Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean) also sank during last week's rising tide, but they have also seen huge rallies on a YTD basis. Financials are another sector that was well-represented on last week's loser list. Besides PGR, State Street (STT), Allstate (ALL), Northern Trust (NTRS), Bank of NY Mellon (BK), and Travelers (TRV) all bucked last week's bullish trend. Unlike just about all of last week's winners which are now overbought, many of the week's worst performers are still trading within normal ranges of their 50-day moving averages.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and an awesome trading week ahead r/stocks. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Friday evening to all of you here on &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt;! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 24th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dow ekes out narrow gain Friday for 10th straight positive day, longest rally since 2017: Live updates - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks were mixed Friday as traders assessed the latest corporate earnings results, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average stretched its winning streak to 10 sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 30-stock Dow climbed 2.51 points, or 0.01%, to close at 35,227.69. The S&amp;amp;P 500 added 0.03% to end at 4,536.34, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.22% to finish the session at 14,032.81.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dow narrowly notched its tenth straight day of gains, a feat not seen for the index since August 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis, the S&amp;amp;P 500 added 0.69%, while the Dow gained 2.08%. It was the second positive week in a row for the two indexes. The Nasdaq fell 0.57% for the period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading was volatile Friday as portfolio managers recalibrated their funds to account for an unusual Nasdaq-100 rebalance taking effect Monday. A large volume of index and stock options also expired Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders were still eyeing more corporate earnings after a busy week of quarterly results. Transportation giant CSX fell 3.7% on the back of underwhelming results. American Express, meanwhile, dropped nearly 3.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate earnings have been mixed thus far. Seventy-five percent of S&amp;amp;P 500 companies that have already reported have exceeded analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet data. However, that beat rate is below a three-year average of 80%, according to The Earnings Scout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;″...Overall, early Q2 results appear good enough for equity markets to grind higher for now,” Barclays analyst Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Friday note. “Next week will be more indicative of the broad earnings dynamics, with ~50% of market cap reporting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;It’s a Bird. It’s A Plane! It’s … the US Economy!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just got a bunch of data to round out the economic picture in the second quarter (Q2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short: Not only do we see no sign of recession, but it also doesn’t even look like the economy is looking for a “landing” at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize this could change, but so far the data doesn’t indicate much weakness. Now, the monthly data can be volatile, and subject to revisions. So it helps to look at the last three months. Let’s walk through some of the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Consumption Was Strong&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retail sales rose at a 4.7% annual pace in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core retail sales, excluding categories like vehicle and gas station sales, rose at a 6.3% annual pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for inflation, “real” retail sales rose at a 1.9% annual pace in Q2, and are currently running 6% above the pre-crisis trend!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-20-real-retail-sales-1203x1600.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Supply Side Is Coming Back&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vehicle production rose 7.6% in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Production within the aerospace industry rose 4.7% in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-tech industries are running hot, with production up 3.9%, and almost 17% above pre-pandemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Production of business equipment outside of vehicles and high-tech also looks to have bottomed, which is a positive sign for capex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-20-IP-high-tech-and-business-equipment.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Construction is Booming&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-family housing permits and starts rose 11% in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An index measuring homebuilder sentiment continues to move higher, indicating that builders are getting more positive about future demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, total housing units under construction (single-family and multi-family) are near an all-time record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combine that with a boom in manufacturing construction, and its not a surprise why construction payrolls have increased by 88,000 this year and are about 339,000 above pre-pandemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-20-housing-construction-1201x1600.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;All These Points to Strong Economic Growth&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta Fed puts out a “nowcast” of quarterly real GDP growth that is updated with major economic data releases. Right now, it says the economy grew 2.4% in Q2, after adjusting for inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that is close to actual GDP growth in Q2, it would mean the economy grew 2.6% over the past year. That is not only stronger than the average 2.3% pace of growth between 2010 and 2019, but it also matches the pace of growth over the three years prior to the pandemic (2017-2019), when economic growth picked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is amazing is that the economy accelerated after a poor first half of 2022 even as the Federal Reserve hiked rates aggressively, taking the federal funds rate from 0.25% to 5.25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-20-real-gdp-growth-projected-1206x1600.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.6% over the past year, and headline inflation fell from 9% to 3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really doesn’t get better than that. Perhaps more importantly, there is no reason to believe a major slowdown is in the cards at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Seasonal Bump Absent in Claims Data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the many economic indicators updated this morning, seasonally adjusted initial jobless claims came in stronger than expected, falling to 228K. That reversed the recent jump in claims observed throughout the late spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072023-Claims-1.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the non-seasonally adjusted data helps to explain the recent decline in the adjusted number. As shown below, barring the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, claims remain at one of the higher readings for the current week of the year in recent history. Typically, in late June and early July, seasonal headwinds cause a significant bump in claims. This year, that increase has been relatively modest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pivoting to continuing claims, the indicator had been on the decline since early April, but the first two weeks of July have seen a modest turn higher. At those levels, continuing claims remain in the middle of the range from the few years leading up to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bulls Dominate&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past week has provided some positive developments on the inflation front that in turn sent equities higher. In response, readings on investor sentiment have shown a dramatic positive turn. The latest AAII survey showed more than half of respondents reported as bullish for the first time since April 22, 2021. As we noted in today&amp;#39;s Morning Lineup, this week&amp;#39;s reading ended an over two-year-long streak without a reading above 50% which was the third longest such streak on record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the elevated reading of bullish sentiment, a minor share of respondents are reporting as bearish. In fact, that reading fell to 21.5% this week which is the lowest reading since June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072023-AAII-Bearishsentiment.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year saw a record streak of weeks where bearish sentiment outnumbered bullish sentiment. With the total reversal in sentiment, the bull-bear spread now heavily favors bulls. The spread reached 29.9% this week for the highest reading since April 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gains to bullish sentiment have not entirely come from bears. Neutral sentiment is also reaching new lows, registering just 27.1% this week. Unlike bearish sentiment, that is only the lowest level since the last week of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tonight&amp;#39;s Closer we will discuss the surge in other sentiment indicators and what that has historically meant for S&amp;amp;P 500 performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;DJIA Advances for 8th Straight Day – Historically Bullish for Next 3 Months&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/646ff2a11a4a705724163ead66ed70d6/2fe5ab035e3861fd-b4/s500x750/2cf29a7ed0b4a7661967f45524f61e07137e7ab8.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the 54th time since 1950, DJIA has recorded a daily winning streak of at least eight days. This is DJIA’s first 8-day winning streak since 2019. During the current streak DJIA has advanced 3.93%. Of the prior 53 daily winning streaks lasting eight or more trading days, 26 ended at 8 days, 14 ended at 9 days, 8 made it to 10 days, while 2 made it to 11 and 12 days. DJIA’s longest daily winning streak of 13 days was in January 1987. DJIA also enjoyed an 8-day winning streak in July 1987. Based upon the last 53 streaks, there is only a modest 50.9% chance of the current streak continuing to 9 days or longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, daily winning streaks of 8-trading days or more have been bullish even after they ended. Over the 1-, 2-week, 1-, and 3-month periods after the daily winning streak ended DJIA was higher, 98.1%, 98.1%, 96.2% and 90.6% respectively. The only significant decline within 3 months of a daily streak end was a 19.22% loss in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reality Check for Housing Starts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a blockbuster report for May where Housing Starts and Building Permits both surged, there was a bit of a reality check in June. While Building Permits were expected to come in at 1.50 million, the actual reading came in at 1.44 million representing a 3.7% m/m decline and a drop of 15.3% y/y. One positive of this report, though, was that single-family units actually increased 2.2% and are only down 2.7% y/y even as multi-family units plunged 12.8% m/m and over 30% y/y. With respect to Housing Starts, the headline reading also missed estimates by 46K (1.434 mln vs 1.480 mln). Not only did June&amp;#39;s reading miss forecasts, but May&amp;#39;s reading was revised lower, so that the originally reported 231K beat was more like 159K. Even after that downward revision, though, Housing Starts declined 8.0% m/m and 8.1% y/y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following May&amp;#39;s report, we noted that the 12-month moving average of Housing Starts had broken its streak of 12 straight declines, but this month, the moving average resumed its downtrend and fell to its lowest level since February 2021. Similarly, the 12-month moving average for Building Permits declined below 1.49 million for the first time since December 2020 and posted its 11th straight decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071923-12-Month-average-Shorter-term.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a longer-term look at the 12-month moving average for Housing Starts, it remains in its well-established downtrend. As shown in the chart below, prior periods where this average peaked and started to rollover usually preceded recessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comparison of Housing Starts versus the performance of homebuilder stocks is a perfect example of how the market tends to trade in advance of events. Just as homebuilder stocks peaked four months ahead of the peak in Housing Starts, they bottomed five months in advance of the recent low in the three-month moving average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Homebuilders Hopeful&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing activity has been somewhat muted given a dearth of inventories, but the lack of available existing supply has been positive for homebuilders. The NAHB&amp;#39;s monthly survey of homebuilder sentiment moved higher in July for its seventh straight monthly gain. Even after the rebound, the current level of 56 represents just a 13-month high and is below the range of readings from the few years prior to the pandemic and historic readings in two years before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improvement in the headline index was primarily driven by increases in present sales and traffic. Geographically, the Midwest and South saw some modest softening in sentiment whereas the West and Northeast were much more impressive. The Northeast in particular saw an 8-point jump which ranks in the top decile of all monthly moves on record and brings the index into the top quartile of historical readings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although homebuilder sentiment has been rebounding solidly, it pales in comparison to the strength of homebuilder stocks. Proxied by the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB), homebuilders have continued to set new 52-week highs on a near-daily basis. The ETF has now risen 56% over the past year and has continuously traded in overbought territory (currently extremely overbought with a price more than 2 standard deviations above its 50-DMA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homebuilder earnings are also on deck in the next couple of weeks. Below, we show a screenshot from the Earnings Explorer function of our Custom Portfolios. As shown, all but three S&amp;amp;P 1500 Homebuilders are due to report through the first week of August. Of those, a vast majority have averaged positive moves on earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Dollar is Weakening – Why That’s Good for US Investors&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, we wrote in our 2023 Outlook that the US dollar was poised to weaken, creating tailwinds for Americans who invest in International stocks and S&amp;amp;P 500 earnings. We reiterated that this is starting to happen in our Mid-Year Outlook, “Edging Closer to Normal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows the recent swing in the ICE US Dollar Index, which measures changes in the US dollar against a basket of other currencies, including the euro, yen, British pound, and the Canadian dollar. It rose 27% between May ’21 and September ’22, but has pulled back 12% since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-US-dollar-index-600x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;A Boost for USD-Based International Equity Investors&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an investor in the US uses dollars to buy a basket of international stocks, the interim step is first converting those dollars to the local currency, which introduces currency risk. Note that when you see quotes for international stock exchanges, like the Nikkei (Japan) or the DAX (Germany), those are in local currency terms. To buy European stocks, you must first convert dollars to euros. Your returns are not just dependent on what the European stocks do; it’s also dependent on what happens to the euro relative to the dollar. If the euro appreciates against the dollar, that’s a tailwind to your investment, whereas a stronger dollar acts as a headwind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From September 30th of last year through July 14th, the MSCI EAFE Index, which represents a basket of international stocks across developed markets, outperformed the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index. The MSCI EAFE Index gained 35.2% versus 27.4% for the S&amp;amp;P 500. But as you can see from the table below, that outperformance is because of a tailwind from a weaker dollar. Emerging market stocks have also seen a tailwind from a weaker dollar but have underperformed due to a murky economic picture in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even over the past month and half (May 31st through July 14th), the dollar took a renewed plunge, boosting returns for international stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-USD-and-local-currency-returns-for-indices.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;A Tailwind for Earnings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, movements in the US dollar have negatively correlated with S&amp;amp;P 500 earnings changes. Excluding recessions and post-recession recoveries (since those skew the numbers significantly in either direction), earnings weakness for the S&amp;amp;P 500 has coincided with dollar strength, whereas a weaker US dollar has correlated with stronger earnings growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-USD-vs-earnings-585x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes some intuitive sense once you realize that 40% of S&amp;amp;P 500 revenue comes from outside the US. The logic here is that if a company used to sell a machine abroad that generated the equivalent of $1,000 in the past, now that would be about $1,100 because the local currency rose 10% against the US dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while the US economy is very relevant for S&amp;amp;P 500 company earnings, much of it also hinges on what happens outside the US and what happens with the US dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;# Why Is the Dollar Weakening?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It probably helps to understand why the dollar strengthened in the first place. The simplest explanation is that interest rate differentials between the US and other countries rose – the idea is that if interest rates are much higher in country A rather than country B, money will flow into country A, thus raising the value of that country’s currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows the dollar index on the top panel, while the bottom panel shows the difference between 1-year US treasury yields and EU government 1-year yields. You can see how the dollar has moved higher when interest rate differentials climb, most notably after 2014 and in 2022. In contrast, the dollar has pulled back when the differential falls, which is what happened in 2019-2020 and this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-USD-vs-rate-differentials-601x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short-term interest rates, like 1-year yields, are an estimate of central bank target rates over the next year. 1-year yields in the US surged in 2022 because the Federal Reserve (Fed) raised rates to tame inflation. They were much more aggressive than their counterparts at the European Central Bank (ECB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the difference between the Fed and ECB’s target interest rates below. The differential jumped in 2022 but it’s been pulling back recently. The Fed’s taken its foot off the gas, while the ECB remains aggressive. Since the beginning of the year, the Fed has raised rates by 0.75%-points, whereas the ECB has raised it by 1.5%-points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-central-bank-target-rate-differentials-600x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that US inflation has started to pull back, and is poised to fall further – see our blog from last week discussing this. In contrast, European inflation has remained stubbornly high, which has kept the ECB much more hawkish. In fact, core inflation (excluding volatile components like food and energy) is currently running at 6.8% year-over-year in the Eurozone. That compares to a 4.9% core CPI reading in the US. Up until September 2022, core inflation in the US was running higher than Eurozone core inflation – and then things switched, which shifted investor expectations and sent the dollar lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-core-inflation-US-vs-EU-800x609.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect this dynamic to continue as US inflation eases further, while Europe deals with higher inflation and a more hawkish central bank. Tighter policy does create some headwinds for European equities, but that’s offset by a stronger currency. Combine this with the tailwind that a weaker dollar creates for S&amp;amp;P 500 company earnings, and we are keeping our overweight to US equities while maintaining International developed market stocks at neutral. Emerging markets remain at underweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500&amp;#39;s Best and Worst Performers During a Monster Week&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After weaker-than-expected inflation data inflated the prices of just about every financial asset, there were some very big winners by the end of last week. The table below lists the 20 top-performing stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500 last week, which includes eight stocks that rallied more than 10%. Double-digit gains are typically considered very good for an entire year, so when large-cap stocks move that much in a week, it&amp;#39;s impressive. Topping the list, shares of Match (MTCH) gained nearly 14% followed by DR Horton (DHI), Domino&amp;#39;s (DPZ), and MGM Resorts (MGM). Among these four top performers and the other stocks listed, it is a somewhat eclectic group of stocks. One well-represented group on the list is the homebuilders. Along with DHI, Lennar (LEN) and Pulte (PHM) both also made the list. In terms of YTD returns, though, last week&amp;#39;s biggest winners weren&amp;#39;t solely the ones that have been rallying all along or the losers playing catch up; there was actually a little bit of everything. Three of the stocks listed (Etsy, Newell, and Sealed Air) are still down by double-digit percentages YTD while four (Pulte, Align, salesforce, and Monolithic Power) are up over 50%! Besides those extreme movers, there are also a few stocks that merely had single-digit YTD percentage gains before last week&amp;#39;s spikes higher. One thing that just about all of these stocks have in common now, though, is that they headed into this week at short-term overbought levels of a varying degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, there were just 88 stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500 that declined last week, and only 53 of those fell more than 1%. Of those 53 stocks, the table below lists the 20 worst performers which all fell more than 3%. This is also an eclectic group in terms of both their lines of business and their YTD performance heading into the week. The only stock down by double-digit percentages was Progressive (PGR) which now makes it down on the year as well. Right behind PGR, shares of Carnival (CCL) fell 9.5%, but unlike PGR, it&amp;#39;s still up by over 100% YTD. Besides CCL, two other cruise operators (Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean) also sank during last week&amp;#39;s rising tide, but they have also seen huge rallies on a YTD basis. Financials are another sector that was well-represented on last week&amp;#39;s loser list. Besides PGR, State Street (STT), Allstate (ALL), Northern Trust (NTRS), Bank of NY Mellon (BK), and Travelers (TRV) all bucked last week&amp;#39;s bullish trend. Unlike just about all of last week&amp;#39;s winners which are now overbought, many of the week&amp;#39;s worst performers are still trading within normal ranges of their 50-day moving averages.&lt;/p&gt;

AT&amp;T

The selloff in AT&amp;T shares appears overdone. With expected adjusted EPS of $2.40 for 2023, AT&amp;T stock now trades for a P/E ratio of 6.2. AT&amp;T has traded at an average price-to-earnings ratio of 11.2 over the last decade. We view AT&amp;T as undervalued, with a fair value P/E of 10. As a result, estimated returns for AT&amp;T of 18% per year, based on returns from an expanding valuation multiple, EPS growth, and dividends.

Verizon

We view Verizon as a strong dividend stock. In September 2022, Verizon announced that it was increasing its quarterly dividend 2% to $0.6525. The company has a dividend growth streak of 18 consecutive years.

Based off of the current share price and the midpoint of earnings guidance for 2023, Verizon has a forward P/E of 7.2. We reaffirm our target P/E of 11, leaving potential for significant returns from an expanding multiple. In addition to EPS growth and dividends, we estimate total returns at 16.7% per year over the next five years.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is one of the few bull cases for Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T recently published.

https://i.imgur.com/LeAFFvS.jpg

&gt;Since the Federal Reserve began aggressively hiking interest rates last year, more and more economists warned that a US recession was imminent.

&gt;But that recession has not yet arrived, and there's no sign a recession is near even after reliable indicators like the inverted yield curve flashed red flags.

&gt;According to Societe Generale, ""something very strange has happened"" that explains why a US recession has been delayed, and it has to do with some timely moves made by corporations.

&gt;The bank highlighted that going back to at least 1975, corporate net interest payments would rise as the Fed raised interest rates. But for the first time in a long time, that isn't happening. Instead, as the Fed raised rates over the past 15 months, corporate net interest payments actually fell.

&gt;""Normally when interest rates rise, so too do net debt payments, squeezing profit margins and slowing the economy. But not this time,"" Societe Generale's Albert Edwards said in a Thursday note, pointing to a chart that he called the ""strangest"" he has seen in a very long time.

&gt;So, what exactly is happening?

&gt;It turns out that during the period of near-zero interest rates, especially leading up to the pandemic and during the pandemic, corporations took advantage and refinanced a ton of their liabilities into long-term, low-rate, fixed debt.

&gt;According to data from Bank of America earlier this year, companies bought themselves some time to navigate higher rates. **The debt composition of S&amp;P 500 companies includes just 6% in short-term floating rate debt, just 8% in long-term floating rate debt, 10% in short-term fixed debt, and a whopping 76% in long-term fixed debt.**

&gt;This ""helps explain the recession's tardiness,"" SocGen's Edwards said, highlighting that net interest payments have fallen 25% at a time when they would have risen sharply based on history.

&gt;**""Companies have effectively played the yield curve in reverse and become net beneficiaries of higher rates, adding 5% to profits over the last year instead of deducting 10%+ from profits as usual,"" Edwards said.**

&gt;The lack of a profit decline means companies didn't have to resort to a big wave of layoffs that would have dented the economy and thrown it into a recession.

&gt;The low-rate, long-term debt held by corporations, combined with their pricing power during a time of elevated inflation, means most businesses were able to grow profits in a big way.

&gt;""Interest rates simply aren't working as they once did. It is indeed a mad, mad world,"" Edwards concluded.

&gt;All of this could change if companies have to refinance their debt at higher rates. But with most of their debts not maturing until 2025, 2026, 2027 and beyond, it's possible that interest rates could move lower between now and then, enabling companies to continue to ride the coattails of low rates and ultimately stave off a recession.

But with most of their debts not maturing until 2025, 2026, 2027 and beyond, it&amp;#39;s possible that interest rates could move lower between now and then, enabling companies to continue to ride the coattails of low rates and ultimately stave off a recession.&lt;/p&gt;

674,stocks,"Due to weak fundamentals and other problems hurting the bank's performance, Wells Fargo's operating performance did not improve considerably in Q2 2023 despite an earnings and revenue beat. The bank's overall revenue has decreased due to difficulties in other areas like reduced loan origination and poorer trading gains, and the beat was mostly accredited to higher interest rates that remained for a longer period of time than expected. Although WFC's operational costs came slightly under $13 billion for the quarter, its efficiency ratio is at 63% and is predicted stay within 63-65% for future years, which indicates low efficiency.  
Wells Fargo's share price has been trading sideways for the past couple of years, indicating that the bank has other issues that have been a drag on its shares even though the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates at a pace over the past year, which theoretically is positive for banks and should be a support for higher share prices. Wells Fargo is a bank with a business profile that is heavily oriented towards retail and commercial banking, with less of a focus on investment banking. As a result, it is significantly exposed to increased interest rates. Therefore, even though Wells Fargo would profit from higher interest rates more than some of its direct competitors, the company's share price performance has not differed significantly from that of its peers in recent years due to weakness in other business segments.  
However, assuming that the Federal Reserve is reaching the end of its current rate hike cycle and may, hypothetically, decrease interest rates in 2024 or later, further increases in its efficiency ratio should come primarily from cost-cutting, an area where Wells Fargo has a pretty poor track record.  
At the end of June, its core tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 10.7%, comfortably above its capital requirement of 9.2%. Even though the bank's capital ratio dropped to 8.2% in the bad scenario—one of the greatest drops among U.S. large banks—its capital position is strong, as evidenced by the most recent stress test results. However, this capital ratio was far higher than the minimum required, demonstrating the bank's strong capitalization and ability to continue its capital return to shareholders programme.

#[Stock futures are higher after Dow registers longest winning streak since 2017: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were higher Friday as traders assessed the latest corporate earnings results, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average tried to stretch its winning streak to 10 sessions.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow added 32 points, up 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.2%, and Nasdaq-100 futures ticked up 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Transportation companies CSX and Knight-Swift fell 5% each in the premarket after reporting earnings that underwhelmed Wall Street analysts.
*****
&gt; Corporate earnings have been mixed thus far. Seventy-three percent of S&amp;P 500 companies that have already reported exceeding analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet data. However, that beat rate is below a three-year average of 80%, according to The Earnings Scout.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off an uneven session. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost around 0.7% and 2%, respectively. The Dow was the outlier of the three, adding nearly 164 points, or about 0.5%, for a nine-day rally — its longest since 2017 — and its highest close since March 2022.
*****
&gt; “The mixed broader indices are really reflective of the mixed earnings and economic data that’s come out,” said Greg Bassuk, CEO at AXS Investments. “Beyond Dow components, we’re seeing — across industries — more selling pressure based on these earnings results.”
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are on pace to finish the week up about 2.1% and 0.7%, while the Nasdaq is poised to end 0.4% lower with just Friday’s session remaining.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

At the risk of sounding stupid I'm still going to ask this question. Because if I don't asking dumb questions I might never learn.

The famous ETF IWDA which is very tech heavy (22.1% IT) and top 10 holdings are the big 7. Yet they didn't even drop after yesterdays big drop in tech (Tesla down 10%, Amazon, 3%,...) Nasdaq was down 2,2% and SP was down 0,6%.

Yet the IWDA valuation in Euro is higher then it was 48 hours ago. How is this possible?

It still holds around 90% of Kenvue shares, and it had said previously that it plans to dispose of the rest in one of two ways: either through a spinoff, where J&amp;amp;J shareholders receive distributions of Kenvue stock, or a split-off, whereby J&amp;amp;J shareholders could choose to exchange their shares for Kenvue ones.&lt;br/&gt;
On Thursday, J&amp;amp;J Chief Financial Officer  Joseph Wolk  said the company would opt for the latter split-off option, and that &amp;quot;the launch of the tender could occur as early as the coming days.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

688,stocks,"The world’s biggest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, has warned of a deepening semiconductor slump, as the boom in artificial intelligence fails to offset global economic woes and China’s delayed recovery.

TSMC now expects its 2023 revenue to drop by 10 per cent, rather than the less than 5 per cent it forecast three months ago, the Taiwanese company told investors on Thursday. This would translate into a 15 per cent revenue decrease in the second half of the year, compared with the same period in 2022.

“Three months ago we were probably more optimistic, but now [we are] not. The recovery of the Chinese economy is weaker than we thought, so end-market demand is not as we expected,” said CC Wei, chief executive. “Although we have very good AI end-market demand, it is not enough to offset [that weakness].”

The warning comes as the growth of large language models behind generative AI services such as ChatGPT is boosting the need for high-end processors for data centres, with TSMC making chips for Nvidia, whose AI processor business is booming.

In 2019 I invested about 70% of my networth (6 digits) in an ETF called IWDA.
I saw it as my savingsaccount that is extremely stressfree with little swings.

During the start of this year I was on Twitter alot and the sentiment was extremely bearish. Especially that guy KimDotCom made me scared about the trajectery of the USA.

Mid april I sold my whole ETF portfolio in the run up to 73€. I made a decent profit these 3 years of about 20%.

My mindstate was: this ship is going down, I will be able to buy back lower and if not I will find investments that will give a bigger return.

It dipped lower the week after, but I was cocky and didn't set my buy orders yet thinking it would dip way further.

Jokes on me, it never did, the market just went straight up and it's been bothering me ever since. It's such a stable ETF that even on red days like today it still doesn't go down. And I just live with pain and discomfort ever since. It is clear to me that I might never will be able to buy back at the the price I want.
I know the rules: time in the market beats timing the market, DCA, ... but I guess fear and greed got me.


Any advice books or courses on value investing? I can't just rebuy IWDA in this current mania but I can't just sit and do nothing either. So I want to just this opportunity to become a better value investor and use this situation to build a stronger portfolio that will outperform my previous one.

Things went from relatively stable 2-3% yoy inflation prior to covid, to a quick jump during 2021-2023.

So cpi July 2021 was 5% over July 2020, July '22 was 9% over 2021. July '23 will be 3% over 2022.

cumulative inflation is way up. After a slow steady price increase from 2010-2020, we got a big spike during 2021-2023, and now we resume a slow steady increase from here forward.

doing the math, total inflation is \~18%+ in 3 years since 2020. That's roughly 6-9 years worth of inflation pulled forward.

So what now? Looks like consumers are not consuming less; they are accepting the higher prices.

Now we just wait for wages to hurry up and go up 18% so consumers can pay off their credit card debt? iphone prices will never fall back down, so that means AAPL will reach $300 quicker.

&lt;p&gt;So cpi July 2021 was 5% over July 2020, July &amp;#39;22 was 9% over 2021. July &amp;#39;23 will be 3% over 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cumulative inflation is way up. After a slow steady price increase from 2010-2020, we got a big spike during 2021-2023, and now we resume a slow steady increase from here forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;doing the math, total inflation is ~18%+ in 3 years since 2020. That&amp;#39;s roughly 6-9 years worth of inflation pulled forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what now? Looks like consumers are not consuming less; they are accepting the higher prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we just wait for wages to hurry up and go up 18% so consumers can pay off their credit card debt? iphone prices will never fall back down, so that means AAPL will reach $300 quicker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to buy everything hand over fist? &lt;/p&gt;

# [Stock futures rise slightly after Dow posts a seventh straight day of gains: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/18/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures ticked higher Wednesday night after the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its longest winning streak since 2021.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.1% each. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures climbed 56 points, or 0.16%.
*****
&gt; Carvana shares dropped nearly 8% in premarket trading. The online auto retailer said Tuesday it will post second-quarter earnings results on Wednesday, moving the date of its report up from Aug. 3.
*****
&gt; The Dow notched a seventh straight positive session on Tuesday for its longest string of gains since March 2021. The Dow rose 366.58 points, or 1.06%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.71%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.76%. All three major averages notched their highest closes since April 2022.
*****
&gt; Those gains came as traders pored through quarterly reports from major companies.
*****
&gt; Thus far, the second-quarter earnings season is off to a strong start. Of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have reported results, 82% have exceeded expectations, according to FactSet data. For many investors, the recent streak of gains bolsters the case for a soft-landing scenario. It’s an outlook that has gained traction after last week’s encouraging inflation data.
*****
&gt; “I think that we have to take a hard-landing scenario off the table, and in part, as we approach 2024 it becomes more difficult for us to believe in a downward trajectory to earnings,” Alger’s Ankur Crawford said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “If you look at, you know, a lot of the tech earnings for example, we’ve troughed and now we’re starting to reaccelerate and grow again. That is a very different scenario than where we entered the year,” Crawford added.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs is set to report before the open Wednesday. Other major companies such as Netflix, Tesla, IBM and United Airlines will post earnings after the close.
*****
&gt; June housing data will release Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Housing starts are expected to have dropped by 9.3%, according to economists polled by Dow Jones. That would be down from the huge 21.7% jump in the prior month.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, June building permits are anticipated to have declined 0.7%, according to Dow Jones consensus estimates. That would be down from a 5.2% gain the previous month.

&lt;p&gt;Carvana shares dropped nearly 8% in premarket trading. The online auto retailer said Tuesday it will post second-quarter earnings results on Wednesday, moving the date of its report up from Aug. 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dow notched a seventh straight positive session on Tuesday for its longest string of gains since March 2021. The Dow rose 366.58 points, or 1.06%. The S&amp;amp;P 500 gained 0.71%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.76%. All three major averages notched their highest closes since April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those gains came as traders pored through quarterly reports from major companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, the second-quarter earnings season is off to a strong start. Of the companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 that have reported results, 82% have exceeded expectations, according to FactSet data. For many investors, the recent streak of gains bolsters the case for a soft-landing scenario. It’s an outlook that has gained traction after last week’s encouraging inflation data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think that we have to take a hard-landing scenario off the table, and in part, as we approach 2024 it becomes more difficult for us to believe in a downward trajectory to earnings,” Alger’s Ankur Crawford said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you look at, you know, a lot of the tech earnings for example, we’ve troughed and now we’re starting to reaccelerate and grow again. That is a very different scenario than where we entered the year,” Crawford added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is set to report before the open Wednesday. Other major companies such as Netflix, Tesla, IBM and United Airlines will post earnings after the close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June housing data will release Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Housing starts are expected to have dropped by 9.3%, according to economists polled by Dow Jones. That would be down from the huge 21.7% jump in the prior month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, June building permits are anticipated to have declined 0.7%, according to Dow Jones consensus estimates. That would be down from a 5.2% gain the previous month.&lt;/p&gt;

📊 Our customers across different market segments are currently more cautious due to continued macro-economic uncertainties, and therefore expect a later recovery of their markets. Also, the shape of the recovery slope is still unclear. 

 
⚙️ However, our strong backlog of around €38 billion provides us with a good basis to navigate these short-term uncertainties.

In recent months, the remarkable strides made in AI innovation have ignited a wave of transformative possibilities, captivating our collective imagination with the promise of reshaping industries and the way we work. Today, at Microsoft Inspire, Meta and Microsoft announced support for the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs) on Azure and Windows. Llama 2 is designed to enable developers and organizations to build generative AI-powered tools and experiences. Meta and Microsoft share a commitment to democratizing AI and its benefits and we are excited that Meta is taking an open approach with Llama 2. We offer developers choice in the types of models they build on, supporting open and frontier models and are thrilled to be Meta’s preferred partner as they release their new version of Llama 2 to commercial customers for the first time.

Now Azure customers can fine-tune and deploy the 7B, 13B, and 70B-parameter Llama 2 models easily and more safely on Azure, the platform for the most widely adopted frontier and open models. In addition, Llama will be optimized to run locally on Windows. Windows developers will be able to use Llama by targeting the DirectML execution provider through the ONNX Runtime, allowing a seamless workflow as they bring generative AI experiences to their applications.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/18/microsoft-and-meta-expand-their-ai-partnership-with-llama-2-on-azure-and-windows/""&gt;https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/18/microsoft-and-meta-expand-their-ai-partnership-with-llama-2-on-azure-and-windows/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

2. Interest rate stay the same - ETF will still make slow up moves because of the coupon it receive from underlying

Chipotle announced Tuesday it has signed an agreement with Kuwait-based Alshaya Group, its first-ever franchise partner, to open locations in the Middle East next year. Chipotle currently has just over 50 locations in Canada and Europe. All are company owned and operated, as are its roughly 3,200 U.S. locations. The Alshaya agreement marks the first time Chipotle has enlisted a local franchise retail operator as it moves into a new market. Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol told CNBC in an interview that the initial plan calls for two locations each in Dubai and Kuwait, with exact locations yet to be determined.

Keeping ingredients fresh and real, with local menu tweaks that echo the U.S. experience will be key, he added. “They’ve got great brands, great operations, great people programs, which just gave us confidence that they’d be able to execute the Chipotle proposition effectively in the Middle East,” Niccol said. In evaluating the Middle East market, Niccol said it was important to partner up to ensure success in everything from real estate to hiring to supply chain. Niccol said if the first few Middle East locations are successful, there will hopefully be hundreds more in the region down the line. He added the agreement could serve as a new model as the company looks to other markets. “As we look around the world, we’ll be evaluating all the elements of what makes Chipotle great and if there’s an area where we believe we need a partner, then we’ll consider a partner for it,” 

Niccol said. While the brand has enlisted a franchise partner in this specific expansion journey, don’t expect the franchising opportunity to arise in the U.S. Niccol said there is “no intention” to pursue that path right now. “Our return on invested capital in the U.S. is industry-leading,” he said. “We’ve got the balance sheet and capital available where we can handle the growth with our own capital capability, and I think we’ve demonstrated the ability to operate restaurants effectively.” Chipotle stock is up over 50% in 2023 and is one of the best performers in the restaurant sector.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/18/chipotle-middle-east-locations-coming-next-year-via-alshaya-group-deal.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/18/chipotle-middle-east-locations-coming-next-year-via-alshaya-group-deal.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed in overnight trading as Wall Street looked ahead to a busy earnings day.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained just 5 points, while S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures fell marginally.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off a winning session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise for a sixth straight day and gain 76.32 points, or 0.22%, to notch its highest close of the year. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.39% and 0.93%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Wall Street awaits a packed earnings day Tuesday, with results on deck from Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon and PNC Financial. Earnings from Lockheed Martin and J.B. Hunt are on deck.
*****
&gt; The season comes as recent inflation data boosts the case for a soft-landing scenario among many investors, and stocks continue this year’s rally. But some skepticism lingers.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think we’re in a sweet spot,” SoFi’s Liz Young said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “You wouldn’t have those negative leading indicators, and even some of the concurrent indicators, if we were in a sweet spot.”
*****
&gt; On the economic front, retail sales and industrial production data for June are due out Tuesday.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, July 18th, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Tuesday, July the 18th, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures are little changed ahead of busy earnings day: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock futures were little changed in overnight trading as Wall Street looked ahead to a busy earnings day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained just 5 points, while S&amp;amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures fell marginally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks are coming off a winning session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise for a sixth straight day and gain 76.32 points, or 0.22%, to notch its highest close of the year. The S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.39% and 0.93%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street awaits a packed earnings day Tuesday, with results on deck from Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon and PNC Financial. Earnings from Lockheed Martin and J.B. Hunt are on deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The season comes as recent inflation data boosts the case for a soft-landing scenario among many investors, and stocks continue this year’s rally. But some skepticism lingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we’re in a sweet spot,” SoFi’s Liz Young said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “You wouldn’t have those negative leading indicators, and even some of the concurrent indicators, if we were in a sweet spot.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the economic front, retail sales and industrial production data for June are due out Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bank of America&lt;/strong&gt; — Bank of America added 0.4% in the premarket after beating top and bottom line estimates for the second quarter. BofA’s results were helped by more profitable lending, boosted by higher interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bank of N.Y. Mellon&lt;/strong&gt; — The bank reported better-than-expected profit and revenue for the second quarter. Like BofA, Bank of N.Y. Mellon benefited from the impact of higher interest rates. However, the stock fell more than 1%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/strong&gt; — Verizon gained 1% in premarket trading, while AT&amp;amp;T rose 0.7%. Both have been tumbling in recent days, with AT&amp;amp;T hitting its lowest level since 1993 Monday and Verizon dipping to its lowest since 2010. Analysts have been concerned about potential liability from miles of lead-encased cables across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Masimo&lt;/strong&gt; — Masimo plummeted 28% in the premarket after the medical device maker forecast lower than expected sales for its second quarter, as hospitals cut back on equipment spending amid increased personnel costs.&lt;/p&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

760,stocks,"The 2023 Q2 earnings report for JPMorgan Chase has just been released. Overall, the ER is a remarkable demonstration of the durability and power of the top bank. JPM's results, both top and bottom line, exceeded market forecasts. The fact that the bank declared a solid balance sheet during and after a highly tumultuous time for the banking industry is, in my opinion, more significant.   
The last one or two quarters have been described by certain media as the most difficult for banks since the 2008 crisis. JPM was able to keep a healthy standardised CET1 capital ratio of 13.8% even after the First Republic deal. J.P. Morgan was able to negotiate a favourable price because they were the only reliable buyer for FRC. In a back-of-the-envelope analysis of the transaction, Matt Levine of Bloomberg noted how J.P. Morgan receives good upside and regulatory protection while sharing a large portion of the potential losses if the loans default. Although the estimated $500 million in annual net income for the agreement is small in comparison to the $40 billion or so they already generate, it demonstrates that a bank like JPMorgan can take advantage of the crisis.  
The bank currently has $1.4 trillion in cash and short-term securities, which is a lot of liquidity. I have no doubt that JPM will be able to fulfil these new standards and keep its fortress balance sheet, even though there may be some capital changes and liquidity in the near future as the banking industry adapts to new rules.  
Given the current instability in the banking industry, regulatory standards may be modified in various ways. With Basel III's completion, Dimon himself anticipates ""material changes"" to capital and liquidity. He continued by issuing a warning that the market as a whole as well as end customers would probably be affected by these regulatory changes in the real world.

762,stocks,"**WASHINGTON, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Monday the United States was making good progress in bringing inflation down and she did not expect the U.S. economy to enter into a recession.**

Yellen, speaking to Bloomberg TV from India during a meeting of Group of 20 finance officials, said slower growth in China could spill over to other economies, but the U.S. economy was on ""a good path"" to reducing inflation while the labor market remained strong.

""For the United States, growth has slowed, but our labor market continues to be quite strong. I don't expect a recession,"" Yellen said. ""The most recent inflation data were quite encouraging.""

Data on Monday showed China's economy grew 6.3% in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis, accelerating from 4.5% in the first three months of the year, but well below expectations of 7.3%, as demand weakened at home and abroad.

U.S. data released last month showed gross domestic product increased at a 2% annualized rate in the first quarter, a sharp upward revision from the 1.3% pace reported earlier, but still below the 2.6% growth reported in the fourth quarter.

Yellen downplayed the prospect for U.S. tariff cuts or reductions as part of the Biden administration's push to reestablish relations with Beijing.

She said Chinese officials raised serious concerns, especially about U.S. tariffs, during her visit earlier this month, but the underlying reasons that Washington implemented them in the first place, including unfair trade practices, had not been addressed.

""We have to see what comes out of the four-year review"" of tariffs, Yellen said, adding, ""But I would emphasize that really the underlying concerns have not yet been addressed. And we need to work on that going forward.""

She said U.S. technology restrictions aimed at China were not meant to be ""tit for tat,"" but were focused on national security concerns, and in some cases, human rights abuses.

Yellen said the United States was likely to proceed with a new executive order restricting outbound investment that has also sparked concerns in China, but stressed that these would focus narrowly on three sectors - semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence.

""They would contain a combination of notification requirements, and in a very narrowly scoped portion of these sectors, prohibitions, but these would not be broad controls that would affect U.S. investment broadly in China,"" she said.

Asked if the order was finished, Yellen said, ""We want to make sure that we get it right, and we've been working on the details.""

She said there was a ""good chance"" it would happen, but said it would come with a notice of proposed rulemaking, giving the public a chance to comment on any proposed controls.

Yellen said she did not know about the hacking of emails of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other government officials by a group based in China and did not discuss it with Chinese officials, but said the U.S. government had raised its concerns with Beijing.

With $500 million in private funding, the initiative&amp;#39;s goal is to democratize quantum computing and make the technology accessible to the public. The IonQ quantum computers, which are still under development, hold potential to revolutionize industries such as logistics, finance, pharma, chemistry, and AI. The new FDA Modernization Act 2.0, allowing the use of computer models as an alternative to live animal testing, positions quantum computing favorably.

775,stocks,"An aging population that values its free time set the stage for economic stagnation. Then came Covid-19 and Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Europeans are facing a new economic reality, one they haven’t experienced in decades. They are becoming poorer.

Life on a continent long envied by outsiders for its art de vivre is rapidly losing its shine as Europeans see their purchasing power melt away. 

The French are eating less foie gras and drinking less red wine. Spaniards are stinting on olive oil. Finns are being urged to use saunas on windy days when energy is less expensive. Across Germany, meat and milk consumption has fallen to the lowest level in three decades and the once-booming market for organic food has tanked. Italy’s economic development minister, Adolfo Urso, convened a crisis meeting in May over prices for pasta, the country’s favorite staple, after they jumped by more than double the national inflation rate.

With consumption spending in free fall, Europe tipped into recession at the start of the year, reinforcing a sense of relative economic, political and military decline that kicked in at the start of the century. 


Europe’s current predicament has been long in the making. An aging population with a preference for free time and job security over earnings ushered in years of lackluster economic and productivity growth. Then came the one-two punch of the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s protracted war in Ukraine. By upending global supply chains and sending the prices of energy and food rocketing, the crises aggravated ailments that had been festering for decades. 

Governments’ responses only compounded the problem. To preserve jobs, they steered their subsidies primarily to employers, leaving consumers without a cash cushion when the price shock came. Americans, by contrast, benefited from inexpensive energy and government aid directed primarily at citizens to keep them spending.

In the past, the continent’s formidable export industry might have come to the rescue. But a sluggish recovery in China, a critical market for Europe, is undermining that growth pillar. High energy costs and rampant inflation at a level not seen since the 1970s are dulling manufacturers’ price advantage in international markets and smashing the continent’s once-harmonious labor relations. As global trade cools, Europe’s heavy reliance on exports—which account for about 50% of eurozone GDP versus 10% for the U.S.—is becoming a weakness. 

Private consumption has declined by about 1% in the 20-nation eurozone since the end of 2019 after adjusting for inflation, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based club of mainly wealthy countries. In the U.S., where households enjoy a strong labor market and rising incomes, it has increased by nearly 9%. The European Union now accounts for about 18% of all global consumption spending, compared with 28% for America. Fifteen years ago, the EU and the U.S. each represented about a quarter of that total.

Adjusted for inflation and purchasing power, wages have declined by about 3% since 2019 in Germany, by 3.5% in Italy and Spain and by 6% in Greece. Real wages in the U.S. have increased by about 6% over the same period, according to OECD data. 


The pain reaches far into the middle classes. In Brussels, one of Europe’s richest cities, teachers and nurses stood in line on a recent evening to collect half-price groceries from the back of a truck. The vendor, Happy Hours Market, collects food close to its expiration date from supermarkets and advertises it through an app. Customers can order in the early afternoon and collect their cut-price groceries in the evening. 

“Some customers tell me, because of you I can eat meat two or three times per week,” said Pierre van Hede, who was handing out crates of groceries.

Karim Bouazza, a 33-year-old nurse who was stocking up on half-price meat and fish for his wife and two children, complained that inflation means “you almost need to work a second job to pay for everything.”

Similar services have sprung up across the region, marketing themselves as a way to reduce food waste as well as save money. TooGoodToGo, a company founded in Denmark in 2015 that sells leftover food from retailers and restaurants, has 76 million registered users across Europe, roughly three times the number at the end of 2020. In Germany, Sirplus, a startup created in 2017, offers “rescued” food, including products past their sell-by date, on its online store. So does Motatos, created in Sweden in 2014 and now present in Finland, Germany, Denmark and the U.K.

Spending on high-end groceries has collapsed. Germans consumed 52 kilograms of meat per person in 2022, about 8% less than the previous year and the lowest level since calculations began in 1989. While some of that reflects societal concerns about healthy eating and animal welfare, experts say the trend has been accelerated by meat prices which increased by up to 30% in recent months. Germans are also swapping meats such as beef and veal for less-expensive ones such as poultry, according to the Federal Information Center for Agriculture.

Thomas Wolff, an organic-food supplier near Frankfurt, said his sales fell by up to 30% last year as inflation surged. Wolff said he had hired 33 people earlier in the pandemic to handle strong demand for pricey ecological foodstuffs, but he has since let them all go.

Ronja Ebeling, a 26-year-old consultant and author based in Hamburg, said she saves about one-quarter of her income, partly because she worries about having enough money for retirement. She spends little on clothes or makeup and shares a car with her partner’s father. 


Weak spending and poor demographic prospects are making Europe less attractive for businesses ranging from consumer-goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble to luxury empire LVMH, which are making an ever-larger share of their sales in North America.

“The U.S. consumer is more resilient than in Europe,” Unilever’s chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, said in April.

The eurozone economy grew about 6% over the past 15 years, measured in dollars, compared with 82% for the U.S., according to International Monetary Fund data. That has left the average EU country poorer per head than every U.S. state except Idaho and Mississippi, according to a report this month by the European Centre for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based independent think tank. If the current trend continues, by 2035 the gap between economic output per capita in the U.S. and EU will be as large as that between Japan and Ecuador today, the report said.

On the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, businesses are lobbying for more flights to the U.S. to increase the number of free-spending American tourists, said Maria Frontera, president of the Mallorca Chamber of Commerce’s tourism commission. Americans spend about €260 ($292) per day on average on hotels compared with less than €180 ($202) for Europeans.

“This year we have seen a big change in the behavior of Europeans because of the economic situation we are dealing with,” said Frontera, who recently traveled to Miami to learn how to better cater to American customers.
People enjoy the warm temperatures in a beach bar in the seaside resort of S’Arenal on Mallorca.

Weak growth and rising interest rates are straining Europe’s generous welfare states, which provide popular healthcare services and pensions. European governments find the old recipes for fixing the problem are either becoming unaffordable or have stopped working. Three-quarters of a trillion euros in subsidies, tax breaks and other forms of relief have gone to consumers and businesses to offset higher energy costs—something economists say is now itself fueling inflation, defeating the subsidies’ purpose. 

Public-spending cuts after the global financial crisis starved Europe’s state-funded healthcare systems, especially the U.K.’s National Health Service.

Vivek Trivedi, a 31-year-old anesthesiologist living in Manchester, England, earns about £51,000 ($67,000) per year for a 48-hour workweek. Inflation, which has been about 10% or higher in the U.K. for nearly a year, is devouring his monthly budget, he says. Trivedi said he shops for groceries in discount retailers and spends less on meals out. Some colleagues turned off their heating entirely over recent months, worried they wouldn’t be able to afford sharply higher costs, he said.

Noa Cohen, a 28-year old public-affairs specialist in London, says she could quadruple her salary in the same job by leveraging her U.S. passport to move across the Atlantic. Cohen recently got a 10% pay raise after switching jobs, but the increase was completely swallowed by inflation. She says friends are freezing their eggs because they can’t afford children anytime soon, in the hope that they have enough money in future. 

“It feels like a perma-freeze in living standards,” she said.


Huw Pill, the Bank of England’s chief economist, warned U.K. citizens in April that they need to accept that they are poorer and stop pushing for higher wages. “Yes, we’re all worse off,” he said, saying that seeking to offset rising prices with higher wages would only fuel more inflation.

With European governments needing to increase defense spending and given rising borrowing costs, economists expect taxes to increase, adding pressure on consumers. Taxes in Europe are already high relative to those in other wealthy countries, equivalent to around 40-45% of GDP compared with 27% in the U.S. American workers take home almost three-quarters of their paychecks, including income taxes and Social Security taxes, while French and German workers keep just half. 

The pauperization of Europe has bolstered the ranks of labor unions, which are picking up tens of thousands of members across the continent, reversing a decades long decline. 


Higher unionization may not translate into fuller pockets for members. That’s because many are pushing workers’ preference for more free time over higher pay, even in a world of spiraling skills shortages.

IG Metall, Germany’s biggest trade union, is calling for a four-day work week at current salary levels rather than a pay raise for the country’s metalworkers ahead of collective bargaining negotiations this November. Officials say the shorter week would improve workers’ health and quality of life while at the same time making the industry more attractive to younger workers.



Almost half of employees in Germany’s health industry choose to work around 30 hours per week rather than full time, reflecting tough working conditions, said Frank Werneke, chairman of the country’s United Services Trade Union, which has added about 110,000 new members in recent months, the biggest increase in 22 years. 

Kristian Kallio, a games developer in northern Finland, recently decided to reduce his working week by one-fifth to 30 hours in exchange for a 10% pay cut. He now makes about €2,500 per month. “Who wouldn’t want to work shorter hours?” Kallio said. About one-third of his colleagues took the same deal, although leaders work full-time, said Kallio’s boss, Jaakko Kylmäoja.

Kallio now works from 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. He uses his extra free time for hobbies, to make good food and take long bike rides. “I don’t see a reality where I would go back to normal working hours,” he said.

Igor Chaykovskiy, a 34-year-old IT worker in Paris, joined a trade union earlier this year to press for better pay and conditions. He recently received a 3.5% pay increase, about half the level of inflation. He thinks the union will give workers greater leverage to press managers. Still, it isn’t just about pay. “Maybe they say you don’t have an increase in salary, you have free sports lessons or music lessons,” he said.

Mathias Senn, right, a butcher in Germany’s wealthy Black Forest region, couldn’t find local applicants to replace four workers who are preparing to retire, so he hired an apprentice from India, Rajakumar Bheemappa Lamani. 

At the Stellantis auto factory in Melfi, southern Italy, employees have worked shorter hours for years recently due to the difficulty of procuring raw materials and high energy costs, said Marco Lomio, a trade unionist with the Italian Union of Metalworkers. Hours worked have recently been reduced by around 30% and wages decreased proportionally. 

“Between high inflation and rising energy costs for workers,” said Lomio, “it is difficult to bear all family expenses.”

&lt;p&gt;With consumption spending in free fall, Europe tipped into recession at the start of the year, reinforcing a sense of relative economic, political and military decline that kicked in at the start of the century. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s current predicament has been long in the making. An aging population with a preference for free time and job security over earnings ushered in years of lackluster economic and productivity growth. Then came the one-two punch of the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s protracted war in Ukraine. By upending global supply chains and sending the prices of energy and food rocketing, the crises aggravated ailments that had been festering for decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments’ responses only compounded the problem. To preserve jobs, they steered their subsidies primarily to employers, leaving consumers without a cash cushion when the price shock came. Americans, by contrast, benefited from inexpensive energy and government aid directed primarily at citizens to keep them spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, the continent’s formidable export industry might have come to the rescue. But a sluggish recovery in China, a critical market for Europe, is undermining that growth pillar. High energy costs and rampant inflation at a level not seen since the 1970s are dulling manufacturers’ price advantage in international markets and smashing the continent’s once-harmonious labor relations. As global trade cools, Europe’s heavy reliance on exports—which account for about 50% of eurozone GDP versus 10% for the U.S.—is becoming a weakness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private consumption has declined by about 1% in the 20-nation eurozone since the end of 2019 after adjusting for inflation, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based club of mainly wealthy countries. In the U.S., where households enjoy a strong labor market and rising incomes, it has increased by nearly 9%. The European Union now accounts for about 18% of all global consumption spending, compared with 28% for America. Fifteen years ago, the EU and the U.S. each represented about a quarter of that total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjusted for inflation and purchasing power, wages have declined by about 3% since 2019 in Germany, by 3.5% in Italy and Spain and by 6% in Greece. Real wages in the U.S. have increased by about 6% over the same period, according to OECD data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pain reaches far into the middle classes. In Brussels, one of Europe’s richest cities, teachers and nurses stood in line on a recent evening to collect half-price groceries from the back of a truck. The vendor, Happy Hours Market, collects food close to its expiration date from supermarkets and advertises it through an app. Customers can order in the early afternoon and collect their cut-price groceries in the evening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some customers tell me, because of you I can eat meat two or three times per week,” said Pierre van Hede, who was handing out crates of groceries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karim Bouazza, a 33-year-old nurse who was stocking up on half-price meat and fish for his wife and two children, complained that inflation means “you almost need to work a second job to pay for everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar services have sprung up across the region, marketing themselves as a way to reduce food waste as well as save money. TooGoodToGo, a company founded in Denmark in 2015 that sells leftover food from retailers and restaurants, has 76 million registered users across Europe, roughly three times the number at the end of 2020. In Germany, Sirplus, a startup created in 2017, offers “rescued” food, including products past their sell-by date, on its online store. So does Motatos, created in Sweden in 2014 and now present in Finland, Germany, Denmark and the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending on high-end groceries has collapsed. Germans consumed 52 kilograms of meat per person in 2022, about 8% less than the previous year and the lowest level since calculations began in 1989. While some of that reflects societal concerns about healthy eating and animal welfare, experts say the trend has been accelerated by meat prices which increased by up to 30% in recent months. Germans are also swapping meats such as beef and veal for less-expensive ones such as poultry, according to the Federal Information Center for Agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Wolff, an organic-food supplier near Frankfurt, said his sales fell by up to 30% last year as inflation surged. Wolff said he had hired 33 people earlier in the pandemic to handle strong demand for pricey ecological foodstuffs, but he has since let them all go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ronja Ebeling, a 26-year-old consultant and author based in Hamburg, said she saves about one-quarter of her income, partly because she worries about having enough money for retirement. She spends little on clothes or makeup and shares a car with her partner’s father. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weak spending and poor demographic prospects are making Europe less attractive for businesses ranging from consumer-goods giant Procter &amp;amp; Gamble to luxury empire LVMH, which are making an ever-larger share of their sales in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. consumer is more resilient than in Europe,” Unilever’s chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, said in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eurozone economy grew about 6% over the past 15 years, measured in dollars, compared with 82% for the U.S., according to International Monetary Fund data. That has left the average EU country poorer per head than every U.S. state except Idaho and Mississippi, according to a report this month by the European Centre for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based independent think tank. If the current trend continues, by 2035 the gap between economic output per capita in the U.S. and EU will be as large as that between Japan and Ecuador today, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, businesses are lobbying for more flights to the U.S. to increase the number of free-spending American tourists, said Maria Frontera, president of the Mallorca Chamber of Commerce’s tourism commission. Americans spend about €260 ($292) per day on average on hotels compared with less than €180 ($202) for Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This year we have seen a big change in the behavior of Europeans because of the economic situation we are dealing with,” said Frontera, who recently traveled to Miami to learn how to better cater to American customers.
People enjoy the warm temperatures in a beach bar in the seaside resort of S’Arenal on Mallorca.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weak growth and rising interest rates are straining Europe’s generous welfare states, which provide popular healthcare services and pensions. European governments find the old recipes for fixing the problem are either becoming unaffordable or have stopped working. Three-quarters of a trillion euros in subsidies, tax breaks and other forms of relief have gone to consumers and businesses to offset higher energy costs—something economists say is now itself fueling inflation, defeating the subsidies’ purpose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public-spending cuts after the global financial crisis starved Europe’s state-funded healthcare systems, especially the U.K.’s National Health Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vivek Trivedi, a 31-year-old anesthesiologist living in Manchester, England, earns about £51,000 ($67,000) per year for a 48-hour workweek. Inflation, which has been about 10% or higher in the U.K. for nearly a year, is devouring his monthly budget, he says. Trivedi said he shops for groceries in discount retailers and spends less on meals out. Some colleagues turned off their heating entirely over recent months, worried they wouldn’t be able to afford sharply higher costs, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noa Cohen, a 28-year old public-affairs specialist in London, says she could quadruple her salary in the same job by leveraging her U.S. passport to move across the Atlantic. Cohen recently got a 10% pay raise after switching jobs, but the increase was completely swallowed by inflation. She says friends are freezing their eggs because they can’t afford children anytime soon, in the hope that they have enough money in future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It feels like a perma-freeze in living standards,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huw Pill, the Bank of England’s chief economist, warned U.K. citizens in April that they need to accept that they are poorer and stop pushing for higher wages. “Yes, we’re all worse off,” he said, saying that seeking to offset rising prices with higher wages would only fuel more inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With European governments needing to increase defense spending and given rising borrowing costs, economists expect taxes to increase, adding pressure on consumers. Taxes in Europe are already high relative to those in other wealthy countries, equivalent to around 40-45% of GDP compared with 27% in the U.S. American workers take home almost three-quarters of their paychecks, including income taxes and Social Security taxes, while French and German workers keep just half. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pauperization of Europe has bolstered the ranks of labor unions, which are picking up tens of thousands of members across the continent, reversing a decades long decline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher unionization may not translate into fuller pockets for members. That’s because many are pushing workers’ preference for more free time over higher pay, even in a world of spiraling skills shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IG Metall, Germany’s biggest trade union, is calling for a four-day work week at current salary levels rather than a pay raise for the country’s metalworkers ahead of collective bargaining negotiations this November. Officials say the shorter week would improve workers’ health and quality of life while at the same time making the industry more attractive to younger workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost half of employees in Germany’s health industry choose to work around 30 hours per week rather than full time, reflecting tough working conditions, said Frank Werneke, chairman of the country’s United Services Trade Union, which has added about 110,000 new members in recent months, the biggest increase in 22 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kristian Kallio, a games developer in northern Finland, recently decided to reduce his working week by one-fifth to 30 hours in exchange for a 10% pay cut. He now makes about €2,500 per month. “Who wouldn’t want to work shorter hours?” Kallio said. About one-third of his colleagues took the same deal, although leaders work full-time, said Kallio’s boss, Jaakko Kylmäoja.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kallio now works from 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. He uses his extra free time for hobbies, to make good food and take long bike rides. “I don’t see a reality where I would go back to normal working hours,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Igor Chaykovskiy, a 34-year-old IT worker in Paris, joined a trade union earlier this year to press for better pay and conditions. He recently received a 3.5% pay increase, about half the level of inflation. He thinks the union will give workers greater leverage to press managers. Still, it isn’t just about pay. “Maybe they say you don’t have an increase in salary, you have free sports lessons or music lessons,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathias Senn, right, a butcher in Germany’s wealthy Black Forest region, couldn’t find local applicants to replace four workers who are preparing to retire, so he hired an apprentice from India, Rajakumar Bheemappa Lamani. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Stellantis auto factory in Melfi, southern Italy, employees have worked shorter hours for years recently due to the difficulty of procuring raw materials and high energy costs, said Marco Lomio, a trade unionist with the Italian Union of Metalworkers. Hours worked have recently been reduced by around 30% and wages decreased proportionally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Between high inflation and rising energy costs for workers,” said Lomio, “it is difficult to bear all family expenses.” &lt;/p&gt;

776,stocks,"So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.

I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.

However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.

I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.

The plan:  
\-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)  
\-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)  
\-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)  
\-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)  
\-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)  
\-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)  
\-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)

Some possible additions right now:  
\-Considering Invesco **S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&amp;P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)  
\-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)  
\-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)  
\-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)  
\-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)  
\-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)  
\-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)  
\-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)  
\-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)  
\-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)

So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?

777,stocks,"India will likely be a major driver of Apple’s five-year revenue and installed base growth, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note Monday, citing Apple’s investment in manufacturing in India and the country’s “economic boom.”

The note also reflected a new India-driven price target increase, from $190 to $220, with a bull-case valuation increased to $270. Morgan Stanley also reiterated Apple as their Top Pick.

Morgan Stanley analysts forecast that over the next five years, the country could account for 15% of Apple’s revenue growth — in contrast to 2% in the past five years and $6 billion today — and 20% of the company’s installed base growth.

The revenue growth, which Morgan Stanley forecasts at $40 billion over the next 10 years, would be the “equivalent to Apple ramping an entirely new product category.”

The analysts cite a number of factors in their assessment, including India’s improved electrification and Apple’s clear efforts to build a manufacturing and retail presence in the country. A survey commissioned by Morgan Stanley suggested Indian consumers have an increased desire and ability to purchase iPhones.

Analysts did add a caveat, warning that if India fails to meet its economic and demographic growth marks, “we wouldn’t expect Apple to be as significant of a beneficiary in India.”

But Morgan Stanley’s fundamental thesis is bullish. “All-in, this means that India will be just as important to Apple’s growth algorithm over the next 5+ years as China was in the last 5 years, something we believe the market underappreciates today,” the analysts said.

The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 2.4% and 3.3%, respectively. On Friday, the Dow rose 113.89 points, or 0.33%, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq slipped 0.1% and 0.18%, respectively.

&gt; The moves came on the heels of solid big bank earnings and softer inflation reports that lifted investor sentiment. That heightened some hopes the Federal Reserve may be able to tamp down inflation without tipping the economy into a recession.

&gt; “It’s the Goldilocks scenario, it’s inflation coming down with near record low unemployment,” Kathryn Rooney Vera, chief market strategist at StoneX, told CNBC’s “Last Call” on Friday. “Yes, people have some pain ... with prices, but they have jobs. Evidence is increasingly favorable for the soft landing viewpoint, and immaculate disinflation is what has the market going crazy.”

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paramount Global&lt;/strong&gt; — Shares of the entertainment company fell 2.8% in premarket trading after the latest installment in the “Mission: Impossible” franchise underperformed expectations at the box office. The movie earned $56.2 million domestically over the weekend — which was below the previous movie in the franchise — and $80 million over its first five days of release, according to Variety.&lt;/p&gt;

Cathie Wood’s flagship exchange-traded fund has rallied more than 50% this year. Investors are using that as an opportunity to get out.

They have pulled a net $717 million from the ARK Innovation ETF over the past 12 months, according to FactSet. That exodus marks a notable shift for a fund that had consistently drawn investor cash since its 2014 inception. Once the largest actively managed ETF with nearly $30 billion in assets under management, the fund has shrunk to roughly $9 billion, mostly due to investment losses.

Known by its ticker symbol ARKK, Wood’s fund became an investor darling shortly after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic with hugely successful bets on unprofitable and “disruptive” technology companies. It took in huge amounts of investor money, culminating with a $6.5 billion inflow in the first quarter of 2021, when its share price peaked.

Then, the Federal Reserve’s fastest interest-rate hiking campaign in decades crushed the valuations of unprofitable growth companies, which often attract investors when interest rates are low and returns on safer investments such as CDs are minimal. Shares of ARKK plunged 67% in 2022, but its investors largely held on or bought the dip. Now, analysts say they expect some of those investors are getting out for good.

“You have a whole group of people who got in somewhere near the top and are sitting on horrific losses,” said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Capital Management, which operates an inverse ETF that lets investors bet against Wood’s fund. “I think some of those people have said, ‘I’m never getting back to even; this is probably the best I’m going to do, and it’s time to get out.’”

Wood says the outflows have been small compared with the fund’s assets.

“We have been astonished at our asset retention since February of ‘21,” Wood said in an interview. “It’s a very small number as a percentage of assets, which suggests that it’s far more likely to be people who are taking some profits than some exodus of people who have stayed in the fund through a prolonged down period.”

Despite the recent rally, ARKK shares are trading about 70% below their all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 has climbed 17% this year on hopes the Fed is near the end of its tightening effort; it is still down 6.1% from its early 2022 high.

ARKK’s top five holdings are Tesla, Coinbase Global, Roku, Zoom Video Communications and Block. Only Tesla and Zoom were profitable last year. Tesla holds an 11% weight in the fund, helping power its advance this year. Shares of the electric-vehicle maker have more than doubled in 2023 but, like ARKK, are down sharply from their previous high.

Although technology stocks are strongly back in favor this year, the best performers have mostly been mature, profitable companies that generate significant cash, such as Microsoft and Amazon.com. Unlike two years ago, investors appear to have less interest and patience for companies that aren’t expected to turn a profit until years in the future. Higher interest rates have meant there is a much higher opportunity cost to wait for profitability.

“There’s certainly been a change in sentiment from when the ARK funds were doing really well,” said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA Research. “A lot of the stocks the ETF holds won’t have big cash flows until way out in the future, and it’s a more challenging environment for that with rates expected to be higher for longer.”

Investors say the ARK brand lost its luster after the fund’s prodigious fall. It took another hit after missing out on the monster rally in shares of Nvidia, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the boom of interest in artificial-intelligence technology. ARKK sold the last of its Nvidia position in January, a stake that had long been one of its largest holdings. Nvidia has been the S&amp;P 500’s best performer this year, more than tripling.

“The bloom is off the rose a little bit,” Tuttle said.

Wood says the negative publicity over the past two years has been an opportunity for ARK to solidify its brand as an asset manager focused on disruptive innovation.

“I can tell you at the end of ’20 and early ‘21, when we couldn’t do anything wrong and people were just chasing, I felt very uncomfortable,” she said. “Today, I feel very comfortable. We are not seeing that kind of behavior. That tells me there is a wall of worry out there. And that usually sustains a bull market.”

The outflows at ARK are coming while ETF investors appear eager to put money to work in other funds. June was the best month for equity ETF flows since October, according to State Street, while active funds attracted $10 billion of inflows for the month and more than $100 billion over the past 12 months.

Investors displayed “childlike exuberance” and “jumped into the market’s rally with both feet,” Matthew Bartolini, head of Americas research for State Street’s ETF business, said in a research note.

The ARKK fund has an 11% annualized average return since inception, but the average ARKK investor has lost 21% on a dollar-weighted, annualized basis, according to FactSet.

“ARKK shareholders have not timed their purchases well. Many bought high and have yet to sell,” said Elisabeth Kashner, director of global funds research at FactSet.

The fund remains a cash cow for Wood, who owns a majority stake in its parent company, ARK Investment Management. Its 0.75% annual fee is about double the average fee for active ETFs.

Although fee revenue is well off its 2021 peak, ARKK has generated more than $20 million of fees this year. ARK Investment Management currently has the third-highest daily revenue from active equity ETFs, of at least 145 different issuers, according to an analysis from FactSet.

To be sure, the market comeback staged by many of ARKK’s tech-focused holdings surprised many, highlighting the perils of trying to forecast performance.

“If you just look at rates, you would not have expected this great rebound in growth coming into the year,” said Dana D’Auria, co-chief investment officer at Envestnet. “It’s a classic window into why market prognostication doesn’t work. Who would have thought artificial intelligence would boom and create this massive interest?”

&lt;p&gt;“If you just look at rates, you would not have expected this great rebound in growth coming into the year,” said Dana D’Auria, co-chief investment officer at Envestnet. “It’s a classic window into why market prognostication doesn’t work. Who would have thought artificial intelligence would boom and create this massive interest?”&lt;/p&gt;

""As the market does"" what do I mean by this

Let's say I have my own model/prediction about a growth stock, that in exactly 10 years will completely stop making progress, and will just keep making the same amount of money. 

I'm a long term investor, I will predict future revenues - profits, because If the stock stops growing according to my thesis, nothing changes, then revenue doesn't matter - margin won't change it will all magically just become static and flat, profits is the only thing that stays the company's asset the way I see it in this hypothetical made up scenario.

So then, I'm left with this model, that will value a stock based on profits the company will be making in 10 years, what value could that be according to the market ? If the company pay a dividend, is that gonna be the factor that defines the company's value, either dividend, wasted investments, or investments into growth, so it becomes more of a growth stock again, unless it becomes a dividend, so is this whole thing about dividends  ? Because why would I buy a stock if it doesn't make me money

How do I convert dividends into stock value ? What has the market usually agreed upon on average ? 

I may sound confused because I'm

Anyone got some clarity to this ? What am I missing or not undersanding

What I forgot to ask about the dividends was, is it like, is there like a formula agreed upon that say some shit like 10 years * dividends$ * some number = value, even though it may still fluctuate and not be in total corellation to the conventionally agreed value because of human emotions, or further made up predictions about the company's future and it's ability to pay more or less dividends, without all the noise, just pure signal, what is a value of a stock conventionally ?

When top anime streaming platform Crunchyroll was first gaining popularity as a pirated-video site in the mid-2000s, Japanese animation was considered a niche form of entertainment, appealing mainly to enthusiasts known as otaku. Today, it’s a $20 billion industry spanning streaming, games and merchandise, and the company’s hit series, such as One Piece and Demon Slayer, have drawn millions of US and European subscribers.

Crunchyroll, now owned by Sony Group Corp., is setting its sights on India as a major growth market — one that could help the industry further expand from a made-in-Japan subculture into a mainstream and global phenomenon.

The company, founded in 2006 by graduates of the University of California at Berkeley, started off as an anime-sharing site. It eventually began streaming only legitimate content, helped by investment from venture capitalists including former News Corp. President Peter Chernin and ownership by AT&amp;T Inc.’s WarnerMedia. Now the largest anime-dedicated streaming platform in the world, it was bought by Sony in a $1.2 billion deal announced in 2020.

Crunchyroll has more than 100 million registered members, including 11 million paid users, after rapid subscriber growth during the pandemic when people binge-watched exotic content. With growth in Western markets moderating, the anime giant is looking to India for its next breakthrough, according to President Rahul Purini.
“In terms of percentage growth, India will be a significant driver of our growth,” Purini said in an interview ahead of a business trip next week to Mumbai, where he plans to meet potential partners. “They’re small numbers right now, but we believe they will become a significant portion of our subscriber base.”

Crunchyroll is seeing more anime fans in new markets such as South America and Southeast Asia. Expansion in India, with its burgeoning youth population, could prove particularly helpful in turbocharging Sony’s efforts to boost its entertainment content business.

In May, Sony Chief Executive Officer Kenichiro Yoshida shared the company’s long-term vision of increasing users of content, including music, games and movies, by over sixfold to 1 billion people. India is seen as a crucial battleground in that effort, particularly as China remains closed. US streaming services such as Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. are also competing for a bigger audience in India, where the media and entertainment industry is expected to grow by around 10% annually to $60 billion in 2030.

In India, Sony is also closing in on a merger with local TV and film business Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd., a deal that would create a $10 billion media giant.
Sony bought Crunchyroll through affiliate Funimation, a US home-video distributor also running an anime streaming platform. The integration of the two companies during the pandemic was “the biggest challenge” but is well underway, according to Purini, a Funimation veteran. The migration of content and subscribers from Funimation to Crunchyroll is likely to be completed fairly soon, he said.

Crunchyroll’s strategy for India is to acquire more content and to localize anime series using dubbing and subtitles in local languages such as Hindi. The streaming platform recently lowered its prices in the region, which at around $1 a month is roughly a 10th of the price for a comparable, middle-tier plan in the US.

Ironically, the biggest challenge for Crunchyroll is its fight against illegal streaming websites, which are rampant in India. Crunchyroll believes its competitive pricing and unique features will eventually persuade users to opt for paid services.
“If we do our job right, we can convince fans to switch over to an official site,” Purini said. “The other part is that we work in collaboration with our partners, whether it’d be Sony Pictures, whether it’d be our Japanese partners, using all the lawful means at our disposal to be able to talk to fans and address the anti-piracy issue.”

Crunchyroll expects the anime industry will have more than 800 million fans globally by 2025 outside markets in China and Japan. Of those, around 200 million are expected to watch series on official websites, he said. The business is open to acquiring assets to grow in targeted markets, he added.

Sony doesn’t reveal financial details for Crunchyroll, and Purini declined to share detailed sales or profit numbers. Analysts have said that while anime is still a small part of Sony’s chips-to-movies business empire, it’s emerging as a key growth area.
Goldman Sachs upgraded its recommendation on Sony to a “buy” on Thursday, citing expectations for Crunchyroll. Analyst Minami Munakata estimates that in five years, the anime site will account for 36% of all profit at Sony’s picture’s segment, which includes its Hollywood studio and content business, up from just 1% in the year ended in March.

“Given that Crunchyroll is being rolled out in more areas and that demand for dedicated anime streaming services is likely to increase in regions other than North America as the growth of Japanese anime continues overseas, we expect the number of Crunchyroll paid subscribers will increase in the next five years, with regions other than North America becoming the main drivers,” she said in a note.

“Japanese anime is worth more outside of Japan than inside now, and this growth will continue,” Omdia senior analyst James McWhirter said, noting strong box office results for titles such as Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen. He noted that some anime is now being produced outside Japan, including in the US and China.

“Local anime is also challenging Japanese anime, but also supporting the overall growth of the market,” McWhirter said. “The pie will get bigger.”

The biggest competitor to Crunchyroll right now is Netflix, which is also betting big on growing anime fandom. Anime is a popular category among Netflix users in Japan, while Crunchyroll isn’t offering its streaming service in Japan to avoid competing with its local partners. More than half of Netflix’s global subscribers outside Japan watched at least one anime title in 2021, and time spent watching anime has been increasing, according to the company.

Purini said he welcomed competition from Netflix as well as Amazon and Walt Disney Co., as their investments could help grow anime’s overall audience. The new fans, he said, could later turn to Crunchyroll to explore the category more deeply.

The company also remains dedicated to its so-called flywheel strategy of offering fans a broad range of services from streaming and theatrical releases to anime-related merchandise. In addition to its expansion in India, he said, Crunchyroll is also discussing the use of new technologies such as AR and VR in partnerships with big tech companies.

“We want to be everything for someone rather than something for everyone,” Purini said.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;World’s Top Anime Site Crunchyroll Is Sony’s New Money Maker&lt;/p&gt;

794,stocks,"Economists are dialing back recession risks.

Easing inflation, a still-strong labor market and economic resilience led business and academic economists polled by The Wall Street Journal to lower the probability of a recession in the next 12 months to 54% from 61% in the prior two surveys. 

While that probability is still high by historical comparison, it represents the largest month-over-month percentage-point drop since August 2020, as the economy was recovering from a short but sharp recession induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. It reflects the fact that the economy has kept growing even as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates and inflation declined. 

In the latest WSJ survey, economists expected gross domestic product to have grown at a 1.5% annual rate in the second quarter, a sharp uptick from 0.2% in the previous survey. They still expect GDP to eventually contract, but later, and by less, than previously. They expect the economy to grow 0.6% in the third quarter, in contrast to the 0.3% contraction expected in the prior survey, followed by a 0.1% contraction in the fourth. Forecasters said GDP would increase 1% in 2023, measured from the fourth quarter of a year earlier, double the previous forecast of 0.5%. 

Nearly 60% of economists said their main reason for optimism about the economic outlook is their expectation that inflation will continue to slow. The Labor Department’s consumer-price index climbed 3% in June from a year earlier, sharply lower than the peak of 9.1% in June 2022 and the slowest in more than two years. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure—the annual change in the personal-consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy—has fallen from 5.4% in March 2022 to 4.6% in May. Economists expect it to reach 3.7% by the fourth quarter of this year, though that is still well above the Fed’s 2% target.
Pathway to a soft landing

Many economists first began in the middle of last year to project a recession when persistently high inflation prompted the Fed to raise rates at the most aggressive pace in nearly three decades. Historically, lowering the inflation rate materially has always involved higher unemployment and a downturn, and few economists thought this time would be different. 




Now, a pathway to achieve a “soft landing,” or getting inflation down without a recession, is “back on the table,” said Sean Snaith, the director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Forecasting. “At the beginning of this year it seemed more of a pipe dream,” said Snaith. Now, “it seems a recession keeps slipping, slipping, slipping into the future.” Snaith has lowered the probability of recession to 45% from 90% in April.

On average, economists still expect the labor market will lose 10,551 jobs a month in the first quarter of 2024, broadly unchanged from their previous forecast. But unlike in the April survey, economists no longer expect job cuts in the third and fourth quarter of this year. They expect employers will add jobs in the second and third quarters of next year, suggesting any downturn will be mild. 

“Inflation has slowed remarkably already, and we believe will continue to do so because spending growth is slowing substantially and the growth in labor force is helping service providers,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. 

Still, stronger-than-expected economic growth this year will also likely result in the Fed keeping interest rates higher for longer, according to the Journal survey. 

Economists expected the midpoint of the range for the federal-funds rate will peak at 5.4% in December, up sharply from a 5% forecast in the last survey. The latest prediction implies at least one more 25-basis-point increase by the Fed. 
More rate increases, later rate cuts

The Fed last month held its benchmark federal-funds rate steady in a range between 5% and 5.25%, its first pause after 10 consecutive increases since March 2022. Market participants overwhelmingly expect the central bank will raise rates by a quarter-percentage point at its July 25-26 meeting, according to the federal-funds futures market.


Economists are also pushing back their estimates for when the Fed will eventually start cutting rates. In the latest survey, only 10.6% of economists expected a rate cut in the second half of this year, down from 36.8% in the last survey. The majority of economists, nearly 79%, expected the Fed will cut rates in the first half of 2024 as the unemployment rate rises. Some 42.4% expected that first cut will come in the second quarter.

Economists are relatively sanguine about the impact of the end of the government’s pandemic-era pause on student-debt payments, which allowed millions of Americans to avoid a big monthly bill for more than three years.

The resumption of student-loan payments is expected to have a relatively minor impact this fall, shaving 0.2 percentage points, annualized, from consumer spending growth, measured from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of this year.

“We will likely see some slowing in spending growth toward the end of this year as a result of the resumed payments denting certain households’ ability to consume, but we do not think the end to the payment pause will be widespread enough to have a significant effect on overall U.S. household spending,” said Wells Fargo chief economist Jay Bryson.

I think Peter Schiff makes sense on economics, but not his wacky political beliefs (like disbanding the USDOT - ironically stated after he just flew US to London…I guess it was just luck he is still alive, not the FAA).  
  
Anyway, on his most recent podcast (Episode 906): [https://schiffradio.com](https://schiffradio.com) he reiterates some ideas he has been saying for many months. He acknowledged the most recent CPI released this past week, but insists that inflation is going to reverse and go higher.  
  
His reasons:  
  
The dollar is weakening, and will continue to weaken significantly, because:

\-The debt ceiling was suspended, allowing for more money printing to finance continuously expanding   
  US Budget deficits  
\-The BRICS nations are planning a gold-backed currency, so they are moving away from the dollar  
\-China and Saudi Arabia are exploring ways to trade oil using the Chinese Yuan, instead of the US   
  Dollar  
\-He anticipates that at the first sign of trouble, the Fed will go back to more QE

Because of our ever-widening trade deficit, a weaker dollar causes imported goods to be more expensive, adding to inflationary pressures.

A weaker dollar causes commodity prices to rise, adding to inflationary pressures.

801,stocks,"I am in the medical field and prescribe a crap ton of Ozempic, Wegovy, Saxenda, Mounjaro, etc and these therapies are incredible for the diabetes population and also for weight loss.

Yes you missed the gravy train with LLY and NVO. On a side note LLY has the upper hand with Mounjaro AND LLY has new triple combo gut boosters in the pipelines. Anyways that is a topic for another day.

WW bought Sequence who can prescribe these GLP-1 therapies. This is pretty big IMO. I was hoping to get your thoughts on WW.

I get also a lot of consults for obesity, and time and time again, patients report that for a high intensity intervention, the FIRST thing people say is WW. As Buffett would say, a MOAT is pretty important. So now we have  WW, which can be successful, good brand recognition, and NOW the GLP-1 prescription possibility is massive. Patients would love to get access to these. I have patients calling in daily for samples. A telehealth company + WW to help with lifestyle IMO is massive.

I plan to buy HEAVY into WW soon on next paycheck. Saxenda, which is based on victoza for DM should have patents expire soon, which may mean generic option, and it works very well. Rather than see a specialist or primary, these telehealth companies, with their lifestyle (still first line for weight loss) plus GLP-1 therapies, is going to be a good selling point IMO. I cannot think of another mainstream brand doing something this similar.

802,stocks,"If you had to guess, how much money do American households have sitting in their bank accounts today compared to December 31, 2019?  

The answer: household checkable deposits is up a whopping 300% in the last 4 years.    The more I dug into this the more confused I became. 

Here are the household asset levels for different asset types over the last four years.  
Q4 2019 ——&gt;Q1 2023 in millions  

Checkable deposits: from 980,550 to 4,188,022   
Money market: from 2,159,362 to 3,175,515  
Time deposits: from 9,552,703 to 9,525,293  
Corporate equities: from 29,122,532 to 35,820,586  

The growth rate of Checkable deposits has far outpaced other asset classes at a time where the big banks are not offering competitive interest rates. The pre COVID all time high was just 1.26 trillion.  

I know the explanation that most will jump on is that the 1% is just hoarding cash but that doesn’t fully explain the jump.   

The data splitting out the data by wealth brackets hasn’t been updated since Q2 2022 but prior to then there was a 6X jump for the 50-90th wealth percentile and the bottom half in wealth’s bank account balances grew from 102,426 pre COVID to 277,455 in Q2 2022.  

Most of the jump occurred during COVID stimulus spending but has still grown slightly over the last four quarters of data.  

I found this baffling and was wondering if anyone has a good explanation for this.  

My main ideas are that people have saved up money to pay off student loans that’s still sitting in bank accounts or that a lot of people are saving up to buy houses but I was wondering if anyone else had any better ideas.  

Nevertheless, there is a ton of cash sitting on the sidelines. If households decide to pile more money into the stock market they have a lot of ammunition to power the bull market higher.

805,stocks,"Hey y’all, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole that is quantum computing and I’m convinced it will have some significant impact and scalable use cases within the coming years (5-10…+?).

When it comes to investment opportunities relating to emerging/experimental technologies, it can be difficult for retail investors to find early-stage direct investment opportunities. 

BUT, the standout player, IonQ ($IONQ) is publicly traded. Here are some reasons why I’m bullish and think IonQ is oh, so special!

1. IonQ uses trapped ion/photonic computing!! This is really neat because it means their quantum computers do not need to be kept at FREEZING temps like QCs being created by Google, IBM, Rigetti and most others. (Among many other advantages) 

Compared to the trapped ion approach, the qubits generated via superconducting suffer from short coherence times, high error rates, limited connectivity, and higher estimated error-correction overhead

2. Management is fairly new to running a public company but they seem excited and dedicated based off interviews and press releases: “The lead is ours. And we have full intention to take advantage of it.”

3. IonQ is the first and only quantum hardware integrated with all major cloud platforms and software kits!

4. 80% of their system is made outside of the US

5. 55+ US patents, 136 US patents pending, 7 foreign patents, 99 foreign patents pending, 8 US trademarks, 11 US trademarks pending, 17 international trademarks, 7 international trademarks pending

6. Their approach for the near term is to form a limited number of strategic partnerships to develop solutions that open up quantum advantage in select industry sectors (chem, pharma, finance, logistics).

7. What I think sets them apart the most, besides trapped ion, is their focus on scalability. Since their inception, Peter Chapman, their CEO, has been stressing the importance of their QCs being modular, economical, and serviceable. THIS, in my opinion, is the way. Whereas Google and IBM will have huge, frozen, immobile QCs available to contract via the cloud, IonQ will have a portable, scalable product.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 17th, 2023.

# **Dow closes 100 points higher Friday on solid earnings, registers best week since March: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed Friday as strong earnings results from some of the biggest banks and companies kicked off earnings season.
*****
&gt; The 30-stock Dow added 113.89 points, or 0.33%, to close at 34,509.03 and mark its fifth consecutive day of gains. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.10% to close at 4,505.42. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.18%, ending at 14,113.70. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq touched their highest intraday levels since April 2022.
*****
&gt; On a weekly basis, the Dow notched its best performance since March, up 2.3%. The S&amp;P 500 added 2.4%, and the Nasdaq gained 3.3%.
*****
&gt; UnitedHealth shares lifted the blue-chip index Friday as its top performer. The insurance giant jumped more than 7% after it reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings and revenue. The company also raised the lower end of its full-year adjusted earnings guidance. UnitedHealth was also the biggest gainer in the S&amp;P 500′s health-care sector, which advanced 1.5%.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan Chase rose 0.6% after its second-quarter earnings topped expectations. The bank was boosted by higher interest rates and rising interest income. Wells Fargo inched down 0.3%, even though the bank posted better-than-expected results.
*****
&gt; “What we’ve seen out of big bank earnings, especially JPMorgan, is pretty resilient,” said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments.
*****
&gt; “We’re seeing right now [that] default rates are still historically incredibly low and not showing signs of skyrocketing higher. So that’s a good sign for consumers and the economy,” Ladner added.
*****
&gt; Expectations for this season are downbeat, with analysts forecasting a roughly 7% year-over-year drop in S&amp;P 500 earnings, according to FactSet. That would mark the worst earnings season since the second quarter of 2020, when S&amp;P 500 profits dropped 31.6%.
*****
&gt; Investors’ sentiment has been lifted by soft inflation reports this week. The latest producer price index report showed inflation rose less than anticipated and built on trader optimism from the June consumer price index data, which came out Wednesday. Investors are now considering whether a strong economy illustrated by the recent data could push stocks higher by the end of the year.
*****
&gt; “The Goldilocks scenario is alive and well, in terms of declining inflation pressures and [there’s] still fairly robust economic growth. So it’s a pretty good backdrop for risk assets,” said Ladner.

&gt; Since 1982, the Friday of monthly options expiration week has a bearish bias for DJIA declining 23 times in 41 years with two unchanged years, 1991 and 1995. On Friday the average loss is 0.23% for DJIA and 0.25% for S&amp;P 500. NASDAQ’s record is even weaker, down 25 of 41 years with an average loss of 0.38%. DJIA posts the best full-week performance, up 24 of 41 with an average 0.37% gain. However, NASDAQ has been weakest, down 22 times and the last five straight. The week after monthly options expiration leans bearish for NASDAQ over the longer-term with an average loss. In recent years the track record had been improving until 2015’s across the board, greater than 2% loss.

&gt; # The Path to Lower Inflation is Now Clear

&gt; The June CPI report was a positive surprise, both in terms of the headline numbers as well as the underlying details.

&gt; Headline inflation rose 0.2% in June, which translates to a 2.2% annual pace. Over the past three months, inflation’s averaged about 2.7%, and over the last year it’s up 3.0%. That’s well off the peak pace of over 9% exactly a year ago.

&gt; In my opinion, the reason for the decline is obvious when you look at the chart below. Energy prices drove the inflation surge in 2022, especially after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Energy prices have now declined 17% over the past year, pulling inflation lower. The good news is that food inflation is also easing a lot, rising at an annual pace of just 1.3% over the past 3 months. Remember the surge in egg prices? Well, egg prices have fallen 21% over the past 3 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-headline-CPI-breakdown-698x800.png))**

&gt; All this of course has been occurring for a few months now and shouldn’t be a big surprise.

&gt; The problem until now was that “core inflation,” i.e., inflation once you strip out energy and food prices, remained elevated. But we got good news on that front.

&gt; Core inflation rose just 0.16% in June, which translates to a 1.9% annual pace — the slowest monthly pace since August 2021! That’s great, but as you can see below, the 3-month pace remains above 4%. So, we’ve yet to see a consistent deceleration in core inflation, which is what the Federal Reserve is looking for.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-headline-and-core-CPI-3M-607x800.png))**

&gt; **Positive signs**

&gt; We realize that one month does not make a trend, but a lot of the underlying details point to downward momentum. Let’s look at a few of these.

&gt; Used and new vehicle prices, which make up 9% of the core inflation “basket,” have reversed a lot over the past year. However, used car prices rose in April and May, reversing some of that momentum. But things look to have turned around once again, with used car prices falling 0.5% in June. In fact, prices are likely to fall further over the next few months based on private used car auction data (Ryan pointed this out in his previous blog as well).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-used-car-prices-597x800.png))**

&gt; Moreover, the auto production supply chain bottlenecks are being resolved, and therefore we’re seeing vehicle production increase. As a result, prices for new vehicles have fallen about 0.4% over the past three months, and that downtrend is likely to continue given increased supply.

&gt; The big one is housing inflation, which Ryan and I have been talking a lot about over the past year. Housing makes up 40% of core inflation, but importantly, it does not include home prices. Instead, it’s based on rents. The problem is that there is a significant lag between official rental inflation and private rents data. Private data from Apartment List shows that rents have decelerated from a peak of 18% year-over-year pace to zero as of June! Official data lags this data by about 12 months or so and it’s taken a while to reflect market reality.

&gt; The good news is that official rental inflation appears to be turning lower. Rental inflation was averaging a 9% annual pace between June 2022 and February 2023. However, that’s fallen to about 6% over the past 4 months. That’s still higher than the 2018-2019 average of about 3-3.5%. But given what we’re seeing in market rents, we expect housing inflation to continue decelerating and that’s going to pull core inflation down in a big way later this year and into 2024 as well.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-rents-598x800.png))**

&gt; **What about the rest?**

&gt; Fed Chair Powell has cited “core services ex housing” as still being elevated. We believe it’s their way of saying,

&gt; “Yes, we see vehicle prices heading lower, and acknowledge the lags in housing inflation data; but we want to see the rest of it fall”

&gt; But there’s good news on that front too.

&gt; The Atlanta Federal Reserve calculates something called the “Sticky Price CPI excluding food, energy, and shelter.” Simply put, it measures inflation for items whose prices typically don’t change frequently.

&gt; In June, this sticky price measure was flat. Over the past 3 months it’s running at a 1.4% annual pace, well below the peak of 7.3% we saw 15 months ago. A key piece of this is restaurant food prices, which have slowed down a lot recently on the back of falling food prices. But even things like airfares, daycare and pet care services inflation have been falling.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-sticky-price-CPI-638x800.png))**

&gt; You can see why the June inflation report was positive from so many angles. A low reading is positive by itself, but it also confirmed what we know from other sources about what to expect going forward.

&gt; Perhaps the best news is that inflation is falling, and poised to fall even further, without a rise in unemployment and an economic slowdown. A year ago, Federal Reserve officials and many economists were saying that we probably need to go into a recession for inflation to slow down, and that aggressive rate hikes by the Fed would push us into one.

&gt; Instead, the unemployment rate is at 3.6%, close to 50-year lows. If real GDP growth clocks in around 2% for last quarter (as seems likely), that would mean the economy’s grown at a 2.5% pace over the past year. While inflation’s fallen from 9% to 3%. That’s huge!

&gt; # NASDAQ’s Midyear Rally Ends on Friday

&gt; From its close on June 27 (the fourth from last trading day) through today, NASDAQ has gained 2.7% which makes this year’s NASDAQ midyear rally slightly better than average. Today’s gains were largely fueled by better than anticipated CPI reading. Provided this translates into a better-than-expected PPI report tomorrow, additional gains are likely before NASDAQ’s midyear rally officially ends on Friday, July 14. The end of the rally also coincides with the historical seasonal mid-month July market peak in pre-election years. Since 1950, the second half of July has been weaker than the first half.

&gt; # Inflation Expectations Still on the Decline

&gt; Ahead of Wednesday's CPI, the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCES) was released earlier this week and showed a continuation of the trend where consumer inflation expectations have been falling. Over the next 12 months, the Fed's survey showed that the median expected rate of inflation fell from 4.07% down to 3.83%. While still above its historical average of 3.4%, consumer expectations for inflation over the next year are down to the lowest level since April 2021. Over a longer time horizon, inflation expectations haven't fallen nearly as fast, but they didn't rise anywhere near as much as short-term expectations either. In the June survey, the median expected rate of inflation over the next three years fell from 2.98% down to 2.95%. While that reading barely budged, we would note that current expectations for inflation over the next three years are slightly below the long-term average. Unlike the FOMC, which ditched the term transitory 18 months ago, consumers have remained on team transitory.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071123-NY-Fed-Inflation-Exp.png))**

&gt; One issue which has the potential to push inflation higher is how consumers expect their incomes to change over time. In this month's survey, the median expected rate of earnings growth increased from 2.80% up to 2.98% which is right around the high end of its range from the last two years. As shown in the chart below, while this series has tested the 3% level multiple times, it hasn't been able to bust through it. As it pertains to inflation, that's a good thing, because if consumers expect their incomes to increase, they're probably also less likely to push back on higher prices. At the same time, the fact that this reading has settled into a new higher range relative to its long-term average suggests that getting back down to and staying at levels of inflation that prevailed before COVID may prove to be difficult.

&gt; # Small-caps Catch a Bid

&gt; Small-caps have caught a bid over the last few days with the Russell 2,000 ETF (IWM) rallying more than 3% since last Thursday's close. Over the same time frame, the large-cap S&amp;P 500 is up just 0.3%.

&gt; While large-cap indices have recently traded to 52-week highs, small-caps are still well below 2023 highs made back in Q1. As shown below, though, IWM is currently attempting to break above the top end of the sideways range it has been in over the last month. If it can do that, the highs from earlier in the year will come into sight.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/smalluse.png))**

&gt; The Russell 2,000 (IWM) chart looks pretty interesting over a multi-year time frame. As shown below, the pre-COVID high made in early 2020 has acted as strong support over the past year. While IWM fell sharply during the mini-banking crisis this March, it stopped going down once it reached this key support level, and then it traded sideways and consolidated throughout much of April and May. Going forward, it appears that the Russell has built a strong base over the past year to springboard off of if the bull market for US equities can continue.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/rtyiwm.png))**

&gt; A chart that always captures our attention is the one below that shows Apple's (AAPL) market cap versus the combined market cap of all of the stocks in the small-cap Russell 2,000. Prior to COVID, Apple's market cap wasn't even close to the $2+ trillion market cap of the Russell 2,000. Since late 2021, though, the two have been battling it out. After its huge gain in Q2, Apple is currently in the lead at $2.96 trillion, but the Russell isn't too far behind at $2.81 trillion.

&gt; # Here We Go Again

&gt; “Here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I’ve ever known.”

&gt; -Here I Go Again by Whitesnake

&gt; One of the main reasons we came into 2023 overweight equities (when everyone else was talking recessions and bear markets) was the over-the-top negativity. Rarely is the crowd and obvious trade right when it comes to investing and we assumed should we get any good news, stocks could surprise to the upside. One of the most staggering signs of negativity was the median strategist in this Bloomberg survey was looking for negative stock returns in ’23.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/blog-1.jpg))**

&gt; As we noted in Is Anyone Bullish? (from December 11, 2022), we’d never seen strategists this bearish heading into a new year. Then layer on the fact that stocks were down close to 20% in 2022 and the odds greatly favored a big bounce back year, as stocks were rarely down two years a in a row. Not to mention, the macro backdrop was on much better footing than the M2 is crashing, LEI is down, and yield curve fearmongers were telling us.

&gt; All that happened was that the first six months of this year was the second best start to a year since 2000 for the S&amp;P 500, best start for the NASDAQ in 40 years and the best start ever for the NASDAQ-100.

&gt; Where are we now? Well, similar to the great Whitesnake song in the quote above, here I go again, down the only road I’ve ever known.

&gt; Apparently, the only road these strategists know is doubling down on lower prices, as they expect the most bearish second half EVER. We’ll gladly take the other side to this, as we expect stocks to gain nicely the rest of this year, likely to new all-time highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/blog-2.jpg))**

&gt; Take note the other years they expected lower prices during the final six months of the year were 1999, 2019, 2020, and 2021. All the S&amp;P 500 did those years was gain 7.0%, 9.8%, 21.2%, and 10.9%, respectively, over the final six months. That comes out to a very impressive 12.2% average, not bad, not bad.

&gt; What also has my attention? We have some big inflation data out this week, but we’ve already seen some nice signs that inflation could surprise to the downside. First up, used cars accounted for nearly a third of the jump in inflation the past few years, but it is crashing lower, with used car prices experiencing their largest monthly drop since COVID. Given light auto production is running close to pre-COVID levels, this is another sign supply chains are working again and price pressures are abating.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/blog-3_edit-800x450.png))**

&gt; Speaking of supply chains, the New York Fed Global Supply Chain Pressure Index did jump last month, but it was coming off of the lowest level in history. Bottom line, supply chains are back to normal after years of disruptions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/blog-4-800x309.png))**

&gt; Along with supply chains and used car prices improving, we expect to see shelter take a big dive the second half of this year. Remember, shelter makes up more than 40% of CPI and it has stayed stubbornly high lately. Well, we’ve seen drastic improvements from private data places like Apartment List and Zillow, suggesting that the government’s data will likely follow suit soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/blog-5-598x800.png))**

&gt; Lastly, we’ve been hearing a lot that the trillions of dollars in excess savings that consumers had over COVID was nearly all the way gone. The media are spinning this as a bearish event, as it means consumers aren’t saving anymore and they will run out of money to spend and keep the economy growing. Here’s the issue with that, the savings rate has been trending higher the past year and is more than two percent higher than it was in early 2022. The employment backdrop is still healthy, spending is solid and consumer confidence is improving. To us, all of that is positive.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and an awesome trading week ahead r/stocks. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Friday evening to all of you here on &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt;! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 17th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dow closes 100 points higher Friday on solid earnings, registers best week since March: Live updates - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed Friday as strong earnings results from some of the biggest banks and companies kicked off earnings season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 30-stock Dow added 113.89 points, or 0.33%, to close at 34,509.03 and mark its fifth consecutive day of gains. Meanwhile, the S&amp;amp;P 500 dropped 0.10% to close at 4,505.42. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.18%, ending at 14,113.70. Both the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq touched their highest intraday levels since April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis, the Dow notched its best performance since March, up 2.3%. The S&amp;amp;P 500 added 2.4%, and the Nasdaq gained 3.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth shares lifted the blue-chip index Friday as its top performer. The insurance giant jumped more than 7% after it reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings and revenue. The company also raised the lower end of its full-year adjusted earnings guidance. UnitedHealth was also the biggest gainer in the S&amp;amp;P 500′s health-care sector, which advanced 1.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase rose 0.6% after its second-quarter earnings topped expectations. The bank was boosted by higher interest rates and rising interest income. Wells Fargo inched down 0.3%, even though the bank posted better-than-expected results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve seen out of big bank earnings, especially JPMorgan, is pretty resilient,” said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing right now [that] default rates are still historically incredibly low and not showing signs of skyrocketing higher. So that’s a good sign for consumers and the economy,” Ladner added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expectations for this season are downbeat, with analysts forecasting a roughly 7% year-over-year drop in S&amp;amp;P 500 earnings, according to FactSet. That would mark the worst earnings season since the second quarter of 2020, when S&amp;amp;P 500 profits dropped 31.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors’ sentiment has been lifted by soft inflation reports this week. The latest producer price index report showed inflation rose less than anticipated and built on trader optimism from the June consumer price index data, which came out Wednesday. Investors are now considering whether a strong economy illustrated by the recent data could push stocks higher by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Goldilocks scenario is alive and well, in terms of declining inflation pressures and [there’s] still fairly robust economic growth. So it’s a pretty good backdrop for risk assets,” said Ladner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;NASDAQ Down 5 Straight During July Monthly Options Expiration Week&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/0e35ad96acb434fc8ff47cfbe253ba09/4a5924a75bd97043-2b/s500x750/f43f7c12a146f12f283341caf2e57d15204eef2f.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1982, the Friday of monthly options expiration week has a bearish bias for DJIA declining 23 times in 41 years with two unchanged years, 1991 and 1995. On Friday the average loss is 0.23% for DJIA and 0.25% for S&amp;amp;P 500. NASDAQ’s record is even weaker, down 25 of 41 years with an average loss of 0.38%. DJIA posts the best full-week performance, up 24 of 41 with an average 0.37% gain. However, NASDAQ has been weakest, down 22 times and the last five straight. The week after monthly options expiration leans bearish for NASDAQ over the longer-term with an average loss. In recent years the track record had been improving until 2015’s across the board, greater than 2% loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Path to Lower Inflation is Now Clear&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The June CPI report was a positive surprise, both in terms of the headline numbers as well as the underlying details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headline inflation rose 0.2% in June, which translates to a 2.2% annual pace. Over the past three months, inflation’s averaged about 2.7%, and over the last year it’s up 3.0%. That’s well off the peak pace of over 9% exactly a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the reason for the decline is obvious when you look at the chart below. Energy prices drove the inflation surge in 2022, especially after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Energy prices have now declined 17% over the past year, pulling inflation lower. The good news is that food inflation is also easing a lot, rising at an annual pace of just 1.3% over the past 3 months. Remember the surge in egg prices? Well, egg prices have fallen 21% over the past 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-headline-CPI-breakdown-698x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this of course has been occurring for a few months now and shouldn’t be a big surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem until now was that “core inflation,” i.e., inflation once you strip out energy and food prices, remained elevated. But we got good news on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Core inflation rose just 0.16% in June, which translates to a 1.9% annual pace — the slowest monthly pace since August 2021! That’s great, but as you can see below, the 3-month pace remains above 4%. So, we’ve yet to see a consistent deceleration in core inflation, which is what the Federal Reserve is looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-headline-and-core-CPI-3M-607x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We realize that one month does not make a trend, but a lot of the underlying details point to downward momentum. Let’s look at a few of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used and new vehicle prices, which make up 9% of the core inflation “basket,” have reversed a lot over the past year. However, used car prices rose in April and May, reversing some of that momentum. But things look to have turned around once again, with used car prices falling 0.5% in June. In fact, prices are likely to fall further over the next few months based on private used car auction data (Ryan pointed this out in his previous blog as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-used-car-prices-597x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the auto production supply chain bottlenecks are being resolved, and therefore we’re seeing vehicle production increase. As a result, prices for new vehicles have fallen about 0.4% over the past three months, and that downtrend is likely to continue given increased supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big one is housing inflation, which Ryan and I have been talking a lot about over the past year. Housing makes up 40% of core inflation, but importantly, it does not include home prices. Instead, it’s based on rents. The problem is that there is a significant lag between official rental inflation and private rents data. Private data from Apartment List shows that rents have decelerated from a peak of 18% year-over-year pace to zero as of June! Official data lags this data by about 12 months or so and it’s taken a while to reflect market reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that official rental inflation appears to be turning lower. Rental inflation was averaging a 9% annual pace between June 2022 and February 2023. However, that’s fallen to about 6% over the past 4 months. That’s still higher than the 2018-2019 average of about 3-3.5%. But given what we’re seeing in market rents, we expect housing inflation to continue decelerating and that’s going to pull core inflation down in a big way later this year and into 2024 as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-rents-598x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the rest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fed Chair Powell has cited “core services ex housing” as still being elevated. We believe it’s their way of saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, we see vehicle prices heading lower, and acknowledge the lags in housing inflation data; but we want to see the rest of it fall”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s good news on that front too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta Federal Reserve calculates something called the “Sticky Price CPI excluding food, energy, and shelter.” Simply put, it measures inflation for items whose prices typically don’t change frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, this sticky price measure was flat. Over the past 3 months it’s running at a 1.4% annual pace, well below the peak of 7.3% we saw 15 months ago. A key piece of this is restaurant food prices, which have slowed down a lot recently on the back of falling food prices. But even things like airfares, daycare and pet care services inflation have been falling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-sticky-price-CPI-638x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see why the June inflation report was positive from so many angles. A low reading is positive by itself, but it also confirmed what we know from other sources about what to expect going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best news is that inflation is falling, and poised to fall even further, without a rise in unemployment and an economic slowdown. A year ago, Federal Reserve officials and many economists were saying that we probably need to go into a recession for inflation to slow down, and that aggressive rate hikes by the Fed would push us into one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the unemployment rate is at 3.6%, close to 50-year lows. If real GDP growth clocks in around 2% for last quarter (as seems likely), that would mean the economy’s grown at a 2.5% pace over the past year. While inflation’s fallen from 9% to 3%. That’s huge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;NASDAQ’s Midyear Rally Ends on Friday&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From its close on June 27 (the fourth from last trading day) through today, NASDAQ has gained 2.7% which makes this year’s NASDAQ midyear rally slightly better than average. Today’s gains were largely fueled by better than anticipated CPI reading. Provided this translates into a better-than-expected PPI report tomorrow, additional gains are likely before NASDAQ’s midyear rally officially ends on Friday, July 14. The end of the rally also coincides with the historical seasonal mid-month July market peak in pre-election years. Since 1950, the second half of July has been weaker than the first half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Inflation Expectations Still on the Decline&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of Wednesday&amp;#39;s CPI, the New York Fed&amp;#39;s Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCES) was released earlier this week and showed a continuation of the trend where consumer inflation expectations have been falling. Over the next 12 months, the Fed&amp;#39;s survey showed that the median expected rate of inflation fell from 4.07% down to 3.83%. While still above its historical average of 3.4%, consumer expectations for inflation over the next year are down to the lowest level since April 2021. Over a longer time horizon, inflation expectations haven&amp;#39;t fallen nearly as fast, but they didn&amp;#39;t rise anywhere near as much as short-term expectations either. In the June survey, the median expected rate of inflation over the next three years fell from 2.98% down to 2.95%. While that reading barely budged, we would note that current expectations for inflation over the next three years are slightly below the long-term average. Unlike the FOMC, which ditched the term transitory 18 months ago, consumers have remained on team transitory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue which has the potential to push inflation higher is how consumers expect their incomes to change over time. In this month&amp;#39;s survey, the median expected rate of earnings growth increased from 2.80% up to 2.98% which is right around the high end of its range from the last two years. As shown in the chart below, while this series has tested the 3% level multiple times, it hasn&amp;#39;t been able to bust through it. As it pertains to inflation, that&amp;#39;s a good thing, because if consumers expect their incomes to increase, they&amp;#39;re probably also less likely to push back on higher prices. At the same time, the fact that this reading has settled into a new higher range relative to its long-term average suggests that getting back down to and staying at levels of inflation that prevailed before COVID may prove to be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Small-caps Catch a Bid&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small-caps have caught a bid over the last few days with the Russell 2,000 ETF (IWM) rallying more than 3% since last Thursday&amp;#39;s close. Over the same time frame, the large-cap S&amp;amp;P 500 is up just 0.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While large-cap indices have recently traded to 52-week highs, small-caps are still well below 2023 highs made back in Q1. As shown below, though, IWM is currently attempting to break above the top end of the sideways range it has been in over the last month. If it can do that, the highs from earlier in the year will come into sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russell 2,000 (IWM) chart looks pretty interesting over a multi-year time frame. As shown below, the pre-COVID high made in early 2020 has acted as strong support over the past year. While IWM fell sharply during the mini-banking crisis this March, it stopped going down once it reached this key support level, and then it traded sideways and consolidated throughout much of April and May. Going forward, it appears that the Russell has built a strong base over the past year to springboard off of if the bull market for US equities can continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chart that always captures our attention is the one below that shows Apple&amp;#39;s (AAPL) market cap versus the combined market cap of all of the stocks in the small-cap Russell 2,000. Prior to COVID, Apple&amp;#39;s market cap wasn&amp;#39;t even close to the $2+ trillion market cap of the Russell 2,000. Since late 2021, though, the two have been battling it out. After its huge gain in Q2, Apple is currently in the lead at $2.96 trillion, but the Russell isn&amp;#39;t too far behind at $2.81 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Here We Go Again&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I’ve ever known.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Here I Go Again by Whitesnake&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons we came into 2023 overweight equities (when everyone else was talking recessions and bear markets) was the over-the-top negativity. Rarely is the crowd and obvious trade right when it comes to investing and we assumed should we get any good news, stocks could surprise to the upside. One of the most staggering signs of negativity was the median strategist in this Bloomberg survey was looking for negative stock returns in ’23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/blog-1.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we noted in Is Anyone Bullish? (from December 11, 2022), we’d never seen strategists this bearish heading into a new year. Then layer on the fact that stocks were down close to 20% in 2022 and the odds greatly favored a big bounce back year, as stocks were rarely down two years a in a row. Not to mention, the macro backdrop was on much better footing than the M2 is crashing, LEI is down, and yield curve fearmongers were telling us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that happened was that the first six months of this year was the second best start to a year since 2000 for the S&amp;amp;P 500, best start for the NASDAQ in 40 years and the best start ever for the NASDAQ-100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where are we now? Well, similar to the great Whitesnake song in the quote above, here I go again, down the only road I’ve ever known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the only road these strategists know is doubling down on lower prices, as they expect the most bearish second half EVER. We’ll gladly take the other side to this, as we expect stocks to gain nicely the rest of this year, likely to new all-time highs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take note the other years they expected lower prices during the final six months of the year were 1999, 2019, 2020, and 2021. All the S&amp;amp;P 500 did those years was gain 7.0%, 9.8%, 21.2%, and 10.9%, respectively, over the final six months. That comes out to a very impressive 12.2% average, not bad, not bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What also has my attention? We have some big inflation data out this week, but we’ve already seen some nice signs that inflation could surprise to the downside. First up, used cars accounted for nearly a third of the jump in inflation the past few years, but it is crashing lower, with used car prices experiencing their largest monthly drop since COVID. Given light auto production is running close to pre-COVID levels, this is another sign supply chains are working again and price pressures are abating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of supply chains, the New York Fed Global Supply Chain Pressure Index did jump last month, but it was coming off of the lowest level in history. Bottom line, supply chains are back to normal after years of disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with supply chains and used car prices improving, we expect to see shelter take a big dive the second half of this year. Remember, shelter makes up more than 40% of CPI and it has stayed stubbornly high lately. Well, we’ve seen drastic improvements from private data places like Apartment List and Zillow, suggesting that the government’s data will likely follow suit soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we’ve been hearing a lot that the trillions of dollars in excess savings that consumers had over COVID was nearly all the way gone. The media are spinning this as a bearish event, as it means consumers aren’t saving anymore and they will run out of money to spend and keep the economy growing. Here’s the issue with that, the savings rate has been trending higher the past year and is more than two percent higher than it was in early 2022. The employment backdrop is still healthy, spending is solid and consumer confidence is improving. To us, all of that is positive.&lt;/p&gt;

No bro, I am like the bottom's brother. Edit: just wanted to clarify - I was very lucky. I do not believe I am a genius who can time the market.

Jokes aside, the discount rate is at 5,25% and stocks like Microsoft trading at 40 P/E with negative EPS growth TTM. Apple is a bit better at 32. Now, I know P/E is just a smell test. But no one in this world can convince me that Microsoft will start growing EPS at such a high rate to justify such a multiple... And historically speaking, such high discount rates make P/E multiples go down and not expand. As Buffett says ""interest rates are like gravity for stocks"". Yet, the SP500 is not down even 10% from its all time high.

Microsoft is so big, it has already almost maximized its profit margin potential - it is improbable they will grow earnings over 20%/year. Another point for this being a mania.

I have to admit - there are still companies I like a lot at these prices who are still beaten down 40-50% despite being great businesses and doing well. The only reason for this is that their CEOs haven't repeated ""AIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAIAIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAII"" 50 times in the last earnings call. 

Where I thrive is software companies(SaaS mostly). Most of them have doubled or tripled in the last few months based on how many times AI has been repeated. Growth has slowed down, costs have staid the same, yet stock prices have skyrocketed?!?!

This tells me that this part of the market is in another maniac phase. To be clear, I haven't sold anything. It is just that the pool of potential investments that can offer great returns has decreased drastically. Investors' optimism about these stocks is making me really nervous. 

Every bit of bad news is dismissed and gets converted into good news. Every bit of good news gets exaggerated by a factor of 100. 

Even though this seems like the end stage of a bull market, I am not betting on it. See how negative I am? I am still in the market. Like Peter Lynch has said - it is important to learn to ignore your gut. Had I listened to my gut, I wouldn't have dared to enter the market in Nov 2022.

Take this post for what you will - human psychology study, ramblings of a random investor... I just feel the need from time to time to let these negative thoughts out. It helps me not to act on them. I still think something will break, but I am ignoring these thoughts.

And historically speaking, such high discount rates make P/E multiples go down and not expand. As Buffett says &amp;quot;interest rates are like gravity for stocks&amp;quot;. Yet, the SP500 is not down even 10% from its all time high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is so big, it has already almost maximized its profit margin potential - it is improbable they will grow earnings over 20%/year. Another point for this being a mania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit - there are still companies I like a lot at these prices who are still beaten down 40-50% despite being great businesses and doing well. The only reason for this is that their CEOs haven&amp;#39;t repeated &amp;quot;AIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAIAIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAII&amp;quot; 50 times in the last earnings call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I thrive is software companies(SaaS mostly). Most of them have doubled or tripled in the last few months based on how many times AI has been repeated. Growth has slowed down, costs have staid the same, yet stock prices have skyrocketed?!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tells me that this part of the market is in another maniac phase. To be clear, I haven&amp;#39;t sold anything. It is just that the pool of potential investments that can offer great returns has decreased drastically. Investors&amp;#39; optimism about these stocks is making me really nervous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every bit of bad news is dismissed and gets converted into good news. Every bit of good news gets exaggerated by a factor of 100. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this seems like the end stage of a bull market, I am not betting on it. See how negative I am? I am still in the market. Like Peter Lynch has said - it is important to learn to ignore your gut. Had I listened to my gut, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have dared to enter the market in Nov 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this post for what you will - human psychology study, ramblings of a random investor... I just feel the need from time to time to let these negative thoughts out. It helps me not to act on them. I still think something will break, but I am ignoring these thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck to everyone, even if you bought Microsoft at 40 P/E. jk lol&lt;/p&gt;

814,stocks,"A commonly followed measure of consumer confidence in the US economy just increased to the highest level since September 2021.

The first July reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index showed a reading of 72.6 on Friday. The print came in significantly higher than the 65.5 economists had expected and reflected a 13% increase from the month prior. That marks the fastest pace since December 2005, when the economy was recovering from Hurricane Katrina.

""The sharp rise in sentiment was largely attributable to the continued slowdown in inflation along with stability in labor markets,"" Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu said in the release.

Consumers have had plenty to be bullish about recently, including: A month of largely strong economic data, upbeat reports to kick-off second quarter earnings and waning fears of a second Federal Reserve rate hike in the back half of the year propelling the 2023 stock market rally higher.

A 19% surge in long-term business conditions and a 16% increase in short-run business conditions were the primary drivers behind Friday's surprise print, according to the University of Michigan. The report did, however, include a slight uptick in consumers inflation expectations.

The expectations for inflation over the next year are now at 3.4%, up from 3.3% in June but down from the highs of 5.4% in April 2022. Analysts had anticipated one-year inflation expectations to tick down to 3.1%

""Easing concerns about a recession, which had been garnering a ton of headlines in the media for most of the year, may have helped push sentiment and expectation higher,"" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet wrote on Friday.

The Friday release follows a week of upbeat economic data. On Wednesday, the Consumers Prices Index for June came in cooler than projected, rising at its slowest pace since March 2021. On Thursday, the Producer Prices Index painted a similar picture. The labor market meanwhile, continued to show resilience with weekly jobless claims of 237,000 coming in lower than expectations for 250,000 claims and below the week prior's 249,000 claims.

Last week's June jobs report showed the labor market is cooling with nonfarm payroll additions coming in short of expectations for the first time in 15 months. But economists were quick to note that the economy still added 209,000 jobs, the unemployment ticked lower to 3.6% and average hourly earnings grew 4.4% from the year prior.

At scale, that data paints a picture of a tight labor market where Americans have jobs while prices for goods continue to decrease.

\[EDIT: removed reference to a substack from the original post\]

**Tools**

Tradingview ([http://www.tradingview.com/](http://www.tradingview.com/))

* Might be the best charting tool in the game. I know a number of professional traders who use this for their personal trading and research

finviz ([https://finviz.com/](https://finviz.com/))

* Very useful stock screener and visualization tool. I often see people posting stock heat maps created with finviz on LinkedIn. 

Yahoo Finance ([https://finance.yahoo.com/](https://finance.yahoo.com/))

* Still the best free tool and database out there for basic research

SEC EDGAR ([https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/))

* the go-to place for searching through SEC filings. User interface can be better, but EDGAR is GOAT when it comes to company-level information

**Newsletters/Blogs**

Matt Levine ([https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine))

Liberty Street Economics ([https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/))

* Wonky stuff, but NY Fed has somewhat made their blog more digestible 

Professor Siegel's Weekly Commentary ([https://resources.wisdomtree.com/weekly-siegel-commentary/archive](https://resources.wisdomtree.com/weekly-siegel-commentary/archive))

* Round-up of the latest in the market. US-centric but there's enough depth to see what the market narratives are

Hedder ([http://www.hedder.com/](http://www.hedder.com/))

* Newsletters written by former hedge fund managers and traders across different verticals and asset classes

Well Fargo ([https://www.wellsfargo.com/cib/insights/economics/weekly-commentary/](https://www.wellsfargo.com/cib/insights/economics/weekly-commentary/))

824,stocks,"JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings Friday that topped analysts’ expectations as the company benefited from higher interest rates and growing interest income.

* Earnings: $4.37 per share adjusted vs. $4 per share Refinitiv estimate
* Revenue: $42.4 billion vs. $38.96 billion estimate

Net income surged 67% to $14.5 billion, or $4.75 per share. When excluding the impact of its First Republic acquisition in early May — a $2.7 billion “bargain purchase gain” from the government-brokered takeover, as well as loan reserve builds and securities losses tied to the purchase — earnings were $4.37 per share.

Revenue rose 34% to $42.4 billion as JPMorgan took advantage of higher rates and solid loan growth. Revenue gains were fueled by a 44% jump in net interest income to $21.9 billion, which topped the StreetAccount estimate by roughly $700 million. Average loans climbed 13%, while deposits fell 6%.

Shares of the bank climbed more than 2% in premarket trading.

JPMorgan has been a standout recently on several fronts. Whether it’s about deposits, funding costs or net interest income — all hot-button topics since the regional banking crisis began in March — the bank has outperformed smaller peers.

That’s helped shares of the bank climb 11% so far this year, compared with the 16% decline of the KBW Bank Index. When JPMorgan last reported results in April, its shares had their biggest earnings-day increase in two decades.

This time around, JPMorgan will have the benefit of owning First Republic after its U.S.-brokered takeover in early May.

The acquisition, which added roughly $203 billion in loans and securities and $92 billion in deposits, may help cushion JPMorgan against some of the headwinds faced by the industry. Banks are losing low-cost deposits as customers find higher-yielding places to park their cash, causing the industry’s funding costs to rise.

That’s pressuring the industry’s profit margins. Last month, several regional banks disclosed lower-than-expected interest revenue, and analysts expect more banks to do the same in coming weeks. On top of that, banks are expected to disclose a slowdown in loan growth and rising costs related to commercial real estate debt, all of which squeeze banks’ bottom lines.

Lenders have begun setting aside more loan-loss provisions on expectations for a slowing economy this year. JPMorgan is expected to post a $2.72 billion provision for credit losses, according to the StreetAccount estimate.

The bank won’t be able to sidestep downturns faced in other areas, namely, the slowdown in trading and investment banking activity. In May, JPMorgan said revenue from those Wall Street activities was headed for a 15% decline from a year earlier.

Finally, analysts will want to hear what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has to say about the health of the economy and his expectations for banking regulation and consolidation.

Wells Fargo
also reported earnings Friday, and Citigroup results are on deck. Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report Tuesday. Goldman Sachs discloses results Wednesday.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

&lt;p&gt;Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you&amp;#39;re holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think shareholders are entitled to shares of TransAlta or cash. Not sure if I want the former and I&amp;#39;d get $13 per share for the latter, which is slightly below the current price. Should I just hold and see what I can get or sell right now and invest in other things?&lt;/p&gt;

848,stocks,"I expect everyone to read this and think I am a silly bear who doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Inflation is falling, the Federal Reserve is going to hike rates once or twice this year and the US of A is saved. 

But let’s look at all the previous crashes in the markets. Things never looked bad, in fact they always looked good. Until something in the financial engineering of the world, broke. 

I won’t go over all the “stock market crashes” but we know this to be the case. In the unprecedented world we live in, after the covid crisis so much has happened. So much in fact that a lot of it we don’t know about, and some of the stuff we know about we don’t know what the true intentions of them were like all the investigations by the SEC or the changes to the capital equity markets etc. 

Now we are in a place where to a retail investor the market looks ripe for investing. Inflation is coming down, the Federal Reserve will hopefully only hike once again this year. Though BofA still expects two rate hikes. 

But is it so simple? Inflation is as the market would say “old news”, “priced in” we know about it. We knew it would fall, and the only real reaction. we would have gotten is if it was rising again. None of this is a surprise. All of this is priced into every model on Wall Street. 

Let’s also keep in mind; Inflation has been moderating recently, but the decrease is largely due to outsized jumps in prices last year, which are rolling off year-ago comparisons. Therefore, the surge in inflation last year was followed by a lull, but inflation is likely to re-accelerate toward the end of the summer.

The US labor market remains resilient, giving the Federal Reserve reason to maintain tight monetary policy. Making it even more likely the Fed will hike rates twice more this year which is one time more than the market currently expects. 

What is happening in the markets? The correlations? What are they telling us about what happens next? 

Inflation in the goods sector has dropped, but the slowdown in orders and reduction in backlogs are affecting employment in the sector.

The US factory sector has continued to slow down, with only four of eighteen industries reporting growth in June. This suggests the goods sector may lead the way into a recession.

Energy and food prices rose in June, contributing to inflation. Housing rents, a major contributor to high inflation, are still rising.

Core inflation, excluding food, energy, and housing rents, remained unchanged in June, showing the lowest monthly reading in nearly two years.

The ISM Manufacturing index has remained in contraction territory for eight consecutive months, indicating a slowdown in the goods sector of the economy.

The trade deficit in goods and services has declined, indicating weakening demand for goods domestically and a trend toward spending on services.

We’re looking at a US Dollar hitting its 15 month lows. The Nasdaq is going to have to perform a “special rebalancing” because the so-called “magnificent seven” are so overvalued that they’re starting to create too much risk for the Nasdaq. 

Behind the scenes of all this “inflation talk” we are still seeing tighter lending and regional banks are struggling again. As per the FED Beige Book released yesterday, July 12, 2023. People are also defaulting on their car payments, and this is before the Student Loan Payments come back in full effect. 

BofA reported today that total card spending per household by their aggregates credit and debit cards is down 2% YoY. This softness is consistent with the slowdown in non-farm payrolls. They state “The latest data flow pushes back against the notion that the economy re-accelerated significantly in 2Q after the soft patch in March. Instead, we appear to be in a period of below trend economic growth and consumer spending.”

China also today, declared that both their imports and exports growth fell below consensus. June exports contracted further by 12.4% YoY vs the -7.5% previously announced. Import growth also softened to -6.8% from the -4.5% in May. Export growth was weaker “across the board”. 

On top of that, despite all of the inflation data we have received, there has been absolutely no deviation from any Fed Speaker even some who are usually quite dovish. We remain with the “higher-for-longer” message, along with the Federal Reserve expectation of 2 more rate hikes this year and rate cuts further away than the market has priced in, according to Jerome Powell. Note the second rate hike has not been priced in to the market, despite not one Fed Speaker deviating from that message. 

The market euphoria is creating an inefficiency which will eventually be taken advantage of. As Sun Tzu states, defeat is not brought by yourself, but it is brought on by the enemy. Anyone buying this market is bringing themselves to be defeated because the underlying picture is much more grimy than the media, Joe Biden and his aides, or your friends who also own shares of that “wonderful AI stock” would tell you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect everyone to read this and think I am a silly bear who doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

Disney CEO Bob Iger opened the door to selling the company’s linear TV assets as the business struggles during the media industry’s transition to streaming and digital offerings. Iger appeared on CNBC on Thursday, the morning after the company announced it would extend his contract by two years through 2026. He returned to the helm of the company in November after Disney’s board ousted Bob Chapek with a two-year contract through 2024 and plans to find a next successor. “After coming back, I realized the company is facing a lot of challenges, some of them self inflicted,” Iger told CNBC’s Faber on Thursday, noting he’s accomplished a lot of work in seven months but there’s more to be done.

At the top of the list is assessing the traditional TV business, Iger said on Thursday. Disney owns a portfolio of TV networks, from broadcast station ABC to cable-TV channels like ESPN.  Disney is going to be “expansive” in its thinking about the traditional TV business, leaving the door open to a possible sale of the networks. “They may not be core to Disney,” Iger said, adding the creativity that has come from those networks has been key for Disney.  Cable-TV channel ESPN is in a different bucket, however. On that front, Iger said Disney is open to finding a strategic partner, which could take the form of a joint venture or offloading an ownership stake. 

Iger said when he had left the company he had predicted the future of traditional TV and had been “very pessimistic,” and has found since his return that he was right in his thinking, adding it’s worse than he expected. When Iger last spoke with Faber in February, soon after announcing a major restructuring at the company, he said he felt “a sense of obligation” to return to Disney and that his preference was to stay for his two-year contract. “We’ve gotten a lot done very quickly, significant cost reductions and significant realignment of the company,” Iger said. “But dealing head on with some of our biggest challenges.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/disney-ceo-iger-opens-door-to-unloading-tv-assets.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/disney-ceo-iger-opens-door-to-unloading-tv-assets.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Cable-TV channel ESPN is in a different bucket, however. On that front, Iger said Disney is open to finding a strategic partner, which could take the form of a joint venture or offloading an ownership stake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iger said when he had left the company he had predicted the future of traditional TV and had been “very pessimistic,” and has found since his return that he was right in his thinking, adding it’s worse than he expected. When Iger last spoke with Faber in February, soon after announcing a major restructuring at the company, he said he felt “a sense of obligation” to return to Disney and that his preference was to stay for his two-year contract. “We’ve gotten a lot done very quickly, significant cost reductions and significant realignment of the company,” Iger said. “But dealing head on with some of our biggest challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;

857,stocks,"I am always curious how ""big events"" impact the value of public companies. This is one of the biggest subreddits and I'd like to hear your thoughts on the latest press release of Domino's.

&amp;#x200B;

Domino's Pizza has been delivering its pizza directly through its app. The company entered into a new global agreement with Uber, allowing customers to place orders via Uber Eats and Postmates, with the delivery being done by Domino's drivers.

The question that should be addressed is, ""What does this mean for the two companies, and how do they benefit from this partnership?""

Based on the press release,  Uber One, and Postmates Unlimited members will receive delivery with **no charge** on their Domino's orders within the Uber Eats and Postmates platforms.

**However, this isn't free**. Uber is a company that makes money from the **fees** it charges for its services. The question is, who bears these costs:

1. Customer bears the costs - The demand for Domino's products could decrease (quantity-wise) due to the higher price. However, this depends on the elasticity of the demand, which isn't known yet. Of course, if the customer has an unlimited membership, it is clear that the cost is either by Uber or Domino's.
2. If Uber bears the cost (By not charging the fee) - It might add value in the form of more customers, but not in additional revenue. This would bring additional revenue to Domino's. It might seem as a win-win scenario, but it is not sustainable, Uber cannot afford to have a business model of this kind for a long period of time with all of its partners (and historically, that wasn't the case)
3. If Domino's bears the cost - This will lead to higher revenue, but lower margins.

After this news, Domino's share price went up over 11%, while Uber's didn't change at all. 

It is not surprising that Uber's share price didn't change, as the additional revenue doesn't represent a significant increase when compared to the total revenue it earns.

7 months into the year and we've had 6 green months so far (assuming July doesn't take a turn for the worse here in the latter half). I hardly find that sustainable with the state of how things are currently. What's the catalyst for a change in direction or keeping the status quo?

I don't see this as the market is decreasing because the fed funds rate is but rather there is/are other determintal things happening in the economy (potentially from rates being too high) that's causing the rate to be lowered and also the market.

Although Nasdaq can also reconstitute the index regularly every December, and there’s also a mechanism to rebalance every quarter as well.
In a statement announcing the move, the exchange alluded to the fact that the largest companies in the technology sector have too much sway over the index’s price. Nasdaq said special rebalancing can be implemented “to address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.”
The rebalancing comes at a critical time. The Nasdaq 100 has risen 40% since the start of 2023, largely thanks to the “Magnificent Seven,” a handful of megacap technology names that have powered much of the U.S. stock market’s rally this year.
These gains have pushed the index to its highest level since mid-January 2022, meaning that Big Tech has now retraced nearly all of last year’s losses, and might soon be headed for the all-time highs from November 2021.
As of Thursday, the Magnificent Seven stocks — Nvidia  Corp. _, Apple Inc. _, Microsoft Corp. _, Amazon.com Inc. _, Tesla Inc. _, Meta Platforms Inc. _ and Alphabet Inc.’s Class A _ and Class C _ shares  — accounted for 55% of the Nasdaq 100’s market capitalization, while the top five names account for more than 45%.
According to Nasdaq’s official methodology, the goal is to keep the aggregate weighting of the biggest stocks below 40%. In fact, it’s possible that Tesla Inc. surpassing 4.5% of the index earlier this month triggered the Nasdaq’s rebalancing announcement, according to analysts from UBS Group AG _.
Exactly how it plans to accomplish this isn’t yet known. Nasdaq said the new weighting scheme will be unveiled on Friday, likely after the U.S. market close. But the UBS team has an educated guess.
The quarterly reviews would dictate that the aggregate weight to securities exceeding 4.5% be set to 40%. If that’s the approach Nasdaq takes, then we’d expect the weights of Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla to be reduced,” the team said in a note shared with MarketWatch","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq announced late last week that the Nasdaq 100 _ will undergo a special rebalancing that will take effect prior to the market open on July 24.

873,stocks,"Does anyone else feel that volatility from inflation data moving markets has gotten less significant over time and the markets are actually more worried about 2023 Q2 earnings than inflation? I was wondering in your opinion how much earnings estimates are actually priced in to the markets.

According to FactSet:

\- Earnings Decline: For Q2 2023, the estimated earnings decline for the S&amp;P 500 is -7.2%. If -7.2% is the actual decline for the quarter, it will mark the largest earnings decline reported by the index since Q2 2020 (-31.6%).

\- Valuation: The forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 18.9. This P/E ratio is above the 5-year average(18.6) and above the 10-year average (17.4).

Furthermore:

\-As of today, 113 S&amp;P 500 companies have issued EPS guidance for the second quarter. This number is above the 5-year average of 96 and above the 10-year average of 98.

\-Of these companies, 67 have issued negative EPS guidance and 46 have issued positive EPS guidance. The number of companies issuing negative EPS guidance is above the 5-year average of 57 and above the 10-year average of 63. The number of companies issuing positive EPS guidance is also above the 5-year average of 40 and above the 10-year average of 35.

\-While the number of S&amp;P 500 companies issuing negative EPS guidance for Q2 is consistent with the numbers in three of the past four quarters, the number of S&amp;P 500 companies issuing positive EPS guidance for Q2 is well above the numbers of the past few quarters.

Finally:

\-In fact, the second quarter has seen the highest number of S&amp;P 500 companies issuing positive EPS guidance for a quarter since Q3 2021 (56).

\-At the sector level, the Information Technology and Industrials sectors have the highest number of companies issuing positive EPS guidance for the second quarter at 20 and 9, respectively. Combined, these two sectors account for more than half (29) of all the companies in the S&amp;P 500 issuing positive EPS guidance for the second quarter (46)

Just looking at some of these data points gives me cause for concern, especially with the amount of positive EPS guidance for tech and Sp500 stocks after the big run-up during the past few months. It seems that there seems to be some divergence with this positive guidance and the negative projected earnings decline for Sp500 for Q2 2023.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else feel that volatility from inflation data moving markets has gotten less significant over time and the markets are actually more worried about 2023 Q2 earnings than inflation?
