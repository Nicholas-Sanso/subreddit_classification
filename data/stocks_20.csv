Nike's shares have faced a third consecutive session of decline, bringing its year-to-date losses to over 20%. The downturn makes Nike the second worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for 2023. Several factors contribute to this trend, including broader market volatility, margin pressures, and challenges in the Chinese market, where Nike does about a third of its business. Despite the decline, the outlook isn't entirely grim. 

The company forecasts mid-single-digit revenue growth for fiscal year 2024, and analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Wells Fargo maintains an 'Overweight' rating on the stock, although it has lowered its price target. With the Jordan brand viewed as a growth catalyst and current valuations suggesting potential upside, Nike still presents opportunities for a rebound.

The company received an [FDA warning letter on or around June 7th](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/IRTC-iRhythm-FDA-letter-high-risk-patients/652265/), which caused it to drop from about $130 to around $100. It bumped back up to around $110, but has been sliding since Aug. 30th, down to $90 to $93. 

Any ideas what's up?

14,stocks,"Currently TSLA is trading close to $265/share, or about an $880B market cap.

It's a reasonable argument that if an asset can beat the S&amp;P 500 CAGR, then it's a good investment. Given that the S&amp;P typically provides a 5% CAGR, let's see what would be needed for Tesla to achieve a 10% CAGR by, let's say.. end of 2030.

$880B \* 1.10\^7 = $1.71T market cap, or about $512/share

So how does Tesla make it to a $1.7T market cap in 2030? I'm going to assume a 30 P/E, which everyone will bitch and complain about beause they hate Tesla, but I think there's reasonable arguments for and against 30. The ""for"" argument being that I believe they'll still be growing EV sales and energy storage products. If a 30 P/E, then Tesla needs:

$1710B / 30 = $57B in gaap earnings

So how much gaap earnings does Tesla make per EV sold? I'll link to a graph of the ""TTM avg gaap earnings per EV sold"" in the comments

Tesla's current earnings profitability is about $5,600 per EV sold, and it continues to go up over the long term, even if rates have caused a recent drop (earnings per EV maxed out at $10.3k in q1 2022). Let's just assume a long term profitability of $5,700 per EV (super conservative imo). Tesla will need to sell about

$57B earnings / $5,700 earnings per EV = 10M EVs annually

Conclusion: If Tesla sells 10M EVs in 2030, then it is not overvalued today, in fact.. it beats the S&amp;P.

17,stocks,"For long term capital gains, you pay 0% tax rate on the first $44,625 of income from long-term capital gains. In general, should gains in non-retirement taxable accounts be harvested at regular intervals to lock in tax-free income?

In my current case I'm looking at rolling some existing assets from one thing to another so a wash sale wouldn't apply since they're not similar in nature. Also the wash rule only applies to losses, and harvesting losses at 0% tax rate would be counter productive.

I'd be making this move anyway, but my question is that I have the option of unloading the current asset in either long- or short-term holdings, and since I have ordinary income it would seem bad to sell off via LIFO as that would be taxed whereas FIFO would not.

Is there anything I'm overlooking?

Edit:

Yes I am overlooking at least one thing - You don't pay 0% tax on capital gains in a separate bucket from ordinary income. Your total taxable income is considered and investment income stacked on top of that.

So if you're working full time you're probably earning over $44k, therefore any LTCG you realize will pay a 15% LTCG tax rate, or perhaps at 20% if you have a huge taxable income.

Microsoft is looking to acquire Nintendo “at some point”, and it believes that the Mario maker’s future “exists off of its own hardware”. Through a flurry of leaked documents involved in the court case between the FTC and Microsoft, it has been revealed that the software giant has been looking to acquire Nintendo since the year 2020. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes that the acquisition of Nintendo by Microsoft would be a “career moment” for him, and he believes it would be a good move for both companies.

In his email to Microsoft’s Executive Vice President and Commercial Chief Marketing Officer, Takeshi Numoto, and Chief Marketing Officer, Chris Capossela, Spencer stated that it’s just taking a long time for Nintendo to see that its future “exists off of their own hardware”, but he is firm in his belief that the acquisition will happen “at some point”, and that Nintendo will eventually see things the way Microsoft does. Nintendo has yet to comment on the leaked statement from Phil Spencer.

Addressing Numoto, Spencer stated that he totally agreed that Nintendo is the prime asset for Microsoft in the Gaming business, and that, today, Gaming is the company’s most likely path to consumer relevance. He mentioned that he has had numerous conversations with the LT of Nintendo about tighter collaboration and felt that if any US company would have a chance with Nintendo, Microsoft would probably be in the best position. According to him, the unfortunate (or fortunate for Nintendo) situation is that the Mario maker is “sitting on a big pile of cash”. He said that Nintendo has a Board of Directors (BoD) that, until recently, have not pushed for further increases in market growth or stock appreciation. He clarified that he said “until recently”, as Microsoft’s former BoD member, ValueAct, has been heavily acquiring shares of Nintendo.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://twistedvoxel.com/microsoft-looking-to-acquire-nintendo-future-exists-off-of-its-hw/""&gt;https://twistedvoxel.com/microsoft-looking-to-acquire-nintendo-future-exists-off-of-its-hw/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

[https://i.imgur.com/RKHteqB.png](This is how my portfolio looks like vs sp500 since March 2019)

* 2019: +18%
* 2020: -6%
* 2021: -7.5%
* 2022: -6.2%
* 2023: -15% Ytd (mostly etf, energy and tech) 

I started investing in individual stocks and etfs with the strategy of ""taking profits if it looks too good and selling off if I lose more than 50%""

My major trades:

- sold 50 tsla with 200% in 2020. It looked too good to be true especially when the whole economy was contracting due to covid. Luxury tech cars would be the first to go. If I had waited 2 years it would be +2000%. 
- bought 2x inversed sp500 in January 2020 but forgot that 15% unemployement and all the shops closed is  like nothing for US economy. A milion deaths here and there doesn't change anything. 
- bought 100 GME in 2019 and sold them for a loss just before the short squeeze because the stock has been on a downfall ever since. I hoped for a pivot of the whole strategy of gamestop for more than a year and finally sold not seeing any upward movement. Instead of +3800% got -27%
- BYND -92%. I broke my rule here because I was on holidays when it dropped. 
- Sold CDR before Cyberpunk release and got +120% because I knew it will be reciebed badly by critics but then bought back ""at sale"" shortly after the fall and sold at a loss seeing how it trends down. 
- sold 100 NVDA in 2020 with +60%. Now it would be  +1000%

My overall realized gains is  -$8,000 and ytd is -15%

There is no hope at all for me. I tried to understand the stock market and can't. Since 2020 there is no logic. Penny stocks are doing +1000%, strong companies that have positive cash flows and very low liabilities are just cruising or going down. Bad companies not bringing any profits are exploding because they are being memes.

And I dont know what to do because it looks like the stock market will be flat for the next couple of years and interest rates for real estate are so humongous I don't qualify. I thought the stock market is the way to park money but this + inflation = I'm losing money left and right.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

26,stocks,"Chevron's earnings have been boosted by soaring energy prices in FY 2022, but as prices consolidate, the company's earnings prospects have deteriorated. CVX is now already deep into an earnings contraction and their Q2'23 free cash flow did not cover shareholder returns. With falling EPS estimates and valuation risks, investors should be cautious.  
Chevron profited in FY 2022 from rising prices for petrol and oil due to favourable market developments. Chevron was able to achieve record profits last year as a result of rising oil prices, but as those prices have begun to stabilise, the energy company's profitability prospects have gotten worse. Given the downward trend in the price of oil and natural gas and the sharp drops in earnings and free cash flow reported by Chevron in Q2'23, I think the company could experience significant losses in a world with lower prices.  
Chevron set forward a bold strategy to increase its free cash flow (estimated 10% FCF growth yearly, Source), but in my opinion, this objective will only be feasible if energy prices continue high. Long-term energy costs have never sustained 10-year highs and have instead consistently stabilised. Because of this, I think investors should prepare for more pressure on Chevron's earnings projections, which have already started to decline significantly. In the past 90 days, analysts have reduced their EPS forecasts for Chevron's fiscal year 2023 twenty times, compared to three upward EPS revisions.  
The largest threat to Chevron is the continuation of the production segment price realisations fall, which had a negative impact on the company's financial results in the second quarter. A severe recession could make this issue worse. Additionally, if Chevron does not comply with Australian unions' pay demands, the company's liquefied natural gas facilities could be shut down, which could put additional pressure on revenues in the near future.  
However, it's possible that a recession won't actually happen, which would be good for Chevron and oil prices. Reuters reports that the likelihood of a recession has just decreased. Energy prices may rise if a recession is avoided, which would reverse Chevron's profitability and free cash flow trend.

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/18/homebuilder-sentiment-goes-negative-for-the-first-time-in-7-months.html

U.S. homebuilders are feeling pessimistic about their business for the first time in seven months, thanks to stubbornly high mortgage rates.

Builder confidence in the single-family housing market fell 5 points in September to 45 on the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index. The decrease follows a 6-point drop in August. Anything below 50 is considered negative.

The index’s three components all declined. Current sales conditions fell 6 points to 51, and sales expectations in the next six months also dropped 6 points to 49. Buyer traffic decreased 5 points to 30.

Builders cite weaker affordability due to higher mortgage rates. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage has been over 7% since June.

As a result, builders are starting to offer more incentives again. In September, 32% of builders said they cut prices, compared with 25% in August. That’s the largest share of builders reducing prices since December 2022, when 35% were doing so.

The average price cut was 6%.

“High mortgage rates are clearly taking a toll on builder confidence and consumer demand, as a growing number of buyers are electing to defer a home purchase until long-term rates move lower,” said Robert Dietz, NAHB’s chief economist, in a release.

A shift is also occurring among those buyers who are still in the market. The NAHB added a new question to this month’s survey and found that 42% of new single-family home buyers year to date were first-time buyers. That is much higher than the historical norm of around 27%.

While builders are still benefiting from the lack of supply on the existing sales market, they are also facing hurdles other than higher interest rates.

“On the supply-side front, builders continue to grapple with shortages of construction workers, buildable lots and distribution transformers, which is further adding to housing affordability woes. Insurance cost and availability is also a growing concern for the housing sector,” said NAHB Chairman Alicia Huey, a homebuilder and developer from Birmingham, Alabama.

Regionally, on a three-month moving average, sentiment in the Northeast fell 2 points to 54. In the Midwest it dropped 3 points to 42.

In the South it declined 4 points to 54, and in the West it decreased 3 points to 47.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

The thesis is simple, Dollar general is not struggling any more or less than others in its industry from shrinkage and inflation.

Yet it’s P/E is 1/3 the industry average even though it outperforms others in the industry that have a 2x or 3x higher PE.

This is a long term investment for about 5-10 years

They have a rapid expansion plan to increase footprint by 50% in 2030 and many cost saving moves in the future. For example self checkout or making their internal trucking service more robust.

Shares of semiconductor firm Arm experienced a whirlwind of market activity recently. The company made an impressive debut on September 14, with its stock surging 25%, taking its valuation to a robust $65 billion. The strong showing provided a much-needed boost to a lackluster IPO market and also encouraged delivery company Instacart to raise its own IPO target price. However, the euphoria was short-lived; Bernstein analysts set a cautionary price target of $46 per share—24% lower than its Friday closing price—prompting a 4% dip in Arm's premarket trading on Monday.  
  
Despite Arm's appeal as a significant player in Artificial Intelligence and cloud computing, analysts are cautioning investors to temper their enthusiasm. The company's high valuation has drawn skepticism, given that it represents a significant premium on a price-to-earnings basis compared to other chipmakers. Bernstein's cautious outlook signals potential downside risks, suggesting that Arm will need to substantiate its valuation, mainly through royalty pricing increases.

Nearly a third of Instacart’s $2.5 billion in revenue last year came from its “highly profitable” ads and software division, according to its prospectus. In the first half of this year, Instacart’s $406 million in revenue from ads and software helped propel it to $242 million in profit.

44,stocks,"TLDR: OXY will have a trillion dollar market cap  20x  it’s current value.

OXY is my largest holding, with a market cap of  58 Billion, it is massively undervalued. This is my investment thesis and I am interested if anyone else has concluded the same.

What they have:  Using chatgpt, assuming an equal distribution of oil in the Permian Basin, the values of their holdings is over 250 billion dollars. This alone is multiples over the existing market cap, but no where near it’s potential.

What they are building: 

Stay with me….

A few years ago Berkshire Hathaway purchased Pilot Flying J, the largest network of interstate diesel pumps in the US. Bill Gates exited the board of Berkshire. Then over the last 2 years Berkshire has built a 25% position in OXY. 

Early this year Gates himself visited Joe Manchin to lobby (successfully)  for Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Buried in it is a unique 45q direct pay tax credit. Essentially the companies that sequester CO2 will be paid directly from the IRS $180 per ton, for 12 years. After it’s passage, OXY immediately began construction of the worlds largest DAC project. Capable of sequestering one million tons per year. Then the DOE granted a billion dollars in grant funding for carbon capture. OXY received half. They turned around immediately and purchase Gate’s Carbon Engineering. 

But the planned DAC facilities are not for sequestration in the long run.  Rather, and this is my theory, they are using gov funds to subsidize the build out of Global e-fuel production network. This is why Berkshire has taken such large positions in OXY and Pilot. Cars will go electric, truck will stay diesel, but it will be produced from the air, not pulled from the ground. And Occidental Petroleum will dominate selling a “green” drop in solution for truckers worldwide. 

OXY will have a trillion dollar market cap  20x it’s current value.

53,stocks,"A Chinese persons look into the growing indian market. 

With a booming population and a growing economy, I can't help but believe that India is on the cusp of what china experienced during the 1990s-2010s. Large economic leaps and lifting people out of poverty. 

Here's just the 2 cents of some random guy, but here's just a few factors I think should be considered. 
More and more manufacturing jobs are moving to India (and other SEA countries) and out of china. China is currently experiencing an internal crisis, where the population is getting older, university graduates can't find jobs and a low morale in many young people. An economy in steady decline, collapsing companies and an authoritarian government on the verge of war. 

To me, this seems like a huge niche that needs to be filled in the market. No better candidate than India, a larger and younger population, growing economy and honestly quite an optimistic future. I admit, there are certain things which probably needs to be quickly fixed, such as quality control issues, especially in larger tech giants. 

Indians have also become a force to be reckoned with overseas, over the course of a few short decades, they have quickly become the highest earners in any country they immigrate to. Often receiving the highest levels of education, in the most difficult and sought after degrees in sectors such as stem, technology etc etc. Regardless of that, indians in India, in general are becoming more and more educated with more opportunities to be able to pursue a better life. All this considered, I feel like I am witnessing the sprouting of what could be the next economic superpower. It's only the beginning and it's hard to tell if this is actually gonna happen, but I will personally be closely looking at the indian stock market over the next decade or so. 

All this considered however, this is not gonna be a fast process, its probably gonna take a few decades as we won't ever witness another insane growth of GDP like china did in the early 2000s

Intel Corporation is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Intel is an integrated device manufacturer (IDM). As a result, Intel designs and manufactures its own chips.

In recent years, Intel has struggled with innovation. Competitors such as TSMC, AMD, and Nvidia have chipped away at Intel’s market share. The previous CEO, Bob Swan, failed to foster a culture of innovation vital to operating in the semiconductor industry. After being replaced in 2021, Bob Swan’s successor, Pat Gelsinger, immediately shifted the company’s focus towards IDM 2.0, focusing on technology and manufacturing capacity. This initiative comes at significant capital costs partially offset by Western nations’ subsidies in the aftermath of global COVID-19 supply chain disruptions.

While risks remain within the plan, IDM 2.0 creates a unique value proposition for potential clients. First, Intel’s current node roadmap is technologically superior to its main competitor, TSMC. Furthermore, Intel will have a geographic monopoly on advanced semiconductor nodes. TSMC’s announced expansions in the United States will no longer be generations behind Intel’s at the estimated time of release.

As a result of these factors, Intel trades at a discount to its Intrinsic value. The market and intrinsic value gap exists due to poor short-term business performance and execution risk.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;**I have a position in INTC**&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, two of Silicon Valley’s most high-profile venture firms, are poised to take a massive hit on their last investment in grocery delivery company Instacart, a deal that closed in 2021 as tech stocks were soaring. In its latest IPO prospectus update, filed Friday, Instacart said it plans to sell shares at $28 to $30 apiece, valuing the company at around $10 billion at the top of the range. That’s more than 75% below where Sequoia and Andreessen invested in early 2021. At that time, Instacart sold shares at $125 a piece for a $39 billion valuation. The delivery economy was booming because of Covid shutdowns, and Instacart’s services were seeing record demand.

&gt;“This past year ushered in a new normal, changing the way people shop for groceries and goods,” Instacart finance chief Nick Giovanni said in a press release at the time. In the more than two years since then, Instacart and its investors have learned that growth during that period was anything but normal. Instacart was closing out a quarter in which revenue surged 200%. In the quarter before, sales jumped almost sevenfold. Instacart said it was preparing to increase head count by 50% and bolster investment in advertising.

&gt;It’s also true that venture firms haven’t seen any real returns from IPOs since before the 2022 market collapse. The dearth of exits is particularly stark because VCs invested record amounts of capital in 2020 and 2021, including deals at high valuations in areas such as crypto and fintech.

57,stocks,"Coke or Pepsi? These two companies have dominated the soft drinks industry for over a century. Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. A famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that [some argue they have shaped modern marketing](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/coke-vs-pepsi-rivalry-brand-marketing-metaverse/621711/). Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, [it's hard to say that today](https://awario.com/blog/coke-vs-pepsi-analysis/). Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.  
  
So, which company is the better investment choice? We all know that [Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052615/why-did-warren-buffett-invest-heavily-cocacola-ko-late-1980s.asp) and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, [making up almost 7% of his portfolio](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc#tabholdings_tab_link). Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead?  
  
Historically, [Pepsi's total return has been higher than Coca Cola's](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). That's been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let's take a look at the latest earnings.

# Latest Earnings 

At the end of July, [Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. Meanwhile, [Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and revenue estimates by 2.7% while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi's stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then. 

# Valuation Metrics

Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. [Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), whereas [Pepsi stands at 24](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke's 9.6. 

# Margins

The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. [Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) than [Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola's margins are more stable than Pepsi's, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that's a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that. 

# Capital Structure

The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of \~$250B and debts of \~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B).   
  
However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke's $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it's nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.

Since that's the case, let's look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. [Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi's outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, [Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi's stock price has been doing better than Coke.

# Dividends 

Coke does have [a better dividend of 3.2%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that's not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don't see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there's just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster.  
  
That's exactly what we see with Pepsi. [Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), that's true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke's at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list. Pepsi's payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don't think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%.   
  
At this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but ***they are almost identical***. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it's raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.

# Technical Analysis

Now, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can't really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi's price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn't closed below it. I think that's a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn't been doing too well. It's down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola's price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we've see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola's price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.

# Price Targets

My personal valuation models put Coca Cola's fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that's somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. The [Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.

On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That's a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi's free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That's why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can't say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. [Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.

# Final Verdict

Now, what's the verdict here? To me, it looks like **the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke**. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. **Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation**. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I'm not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don't have any positions in either of these and I don't think I'll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%. 

That's my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?  
  
**TLDR; Pepsi looks better technically, Coke has a better valuation, but neither are really at a good price point for new entrants.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke or Pepsi? These two companies have dominated the soft drinks industry for over a century. Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. 
A famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that &lt;a href=""https://www.marketingdive.com/news/coke-vs-pepsi-rivalry-brand-marketing-metaverse/621711/""&gt;some argue they have shaped modern marketing&lt;/a&gt;. Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, &lt;a href=""https://awario.com/blog/coke-vs-pepsi-analysis/""&gt;it&amp;#39;s hard to say that today&lt;/a&gt;. Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, which company is the better investment choice?
 We all know that &lt;a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052615/why-did-warren-buffett-invest-heavily-cocacola-ko-late-1980s.asp""&gt;Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties&lt;/a&gt; and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, &lt;a href=""https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc#tabholdings_tab_link""&gt;making up almost 7% of his portfolio&lt;/a&gt;. Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi&amp;#39;s total return has been higher than Coca Cola&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;#39;s been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let&amp;#39;s take a look at the latest earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Latest Earnings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of July, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%&lt;/a&gt;, but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. 
Meanwhile, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6%&lt;/a&gt; and revenue estimates by 2.7% while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi&amp;#39;s stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Valuation Metrics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22&lt;/a&gt;, whereas &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi stands at 24&lt;/a&gt;. However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke&amp;#39;s 9.6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Margins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi&lt;/a&gt; which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola&amp;#39;s margins are more stable than Pepsi&amp;#39;s, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that&amp;#39;s a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Capital Structure&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of ~$250B and debts of ~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke&amp;#39;s $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it&amp;#39;s nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that&amp;#39;s the case, let&amp;#39;s look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases&lt;/a&gt; (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi&amp;#39;s outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares&lt;/a&gt;. Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi&amp;#39;s stock price has been doing better than Coke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dividends&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coke does have &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;a better dividend of 3.2%&lt;/a&gt;. Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that&amp;#39;s not great.

This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s exactly what we see with Pepsi. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;#39;s true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke&amp;#39;s at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list.

The &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars&lt;/a&gt; and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me.

&lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi&lt;/a&gt; with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Final Verdict&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what&amp;#39;s the verdict here? To me, it looks like &lt;strong&gt;the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke&lt;/strong&gt;. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. &lt;strong&gt;Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation&lt;/strong&gt;. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I&amp;#39;m not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don&amp;#39;t have any positions in either of these and I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR; Pepsi looks better technically, Coke has a better valuation, but neither are really at a good price point for new entrants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

60,stocks,"PDD engages in accounting fraud and is less profitable than it claims. It's engineered to reward insiders at the expense of the public equity investor.  
  
\#1 - they are generating revenue for items refunded to pad their profitability numbers  
  
Like some other companies (looking at PayPal here), they take a percentage of the sale even if the item is refunded. In the case of PDD, they use this as an opportunity to misrepresent their revenue and earnings in China significantly. They claim to be subsidizing the Chinese consumer in their marketing. They advertise merchandise at impossibly low prices to generate sales, then they refund the customers. All of this shows up as revenue, and each of these refunded orders has a high profit margin to PDD.  
  
Given their use of other entities to misrepresent their financials, and given that no merchant would go into business on the platform just to lose massive amounts of money to PDD by fulfilling none of the orders, this is another case of moving money from the left hand to the right hand to make their financial look more solid than they are.  
  
A buyer in China talked about this, with regard to Apple iPhones: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vxaihh/pinduoduo\_potential\_1billion\_usd\_financial\_fraud/ - ""PDD started its dramatic promotion activities 'Billions Subsidies', which means that PPD promises that they will spend more than a Billion RMB as Subsidies to help lower price of goods sold on their platform as a strategy to attract customer and supplier, in 2019. ... They do not ship the product. I waited for more than a month. They just refuse to ship the product. PDD customer service guy even ask me to apply for refund. I searched on 'Baidu', a popular search engine in China, millions of PDD cases like this happened, most of them are related to 'Billions Subsidies' Activity. They just make 'Fake Sales'. ... Even if the order is canceled, refunded or in other situations, the transaction fee is not refundable to suppliers. This means that PDD can infinitely recogize its transaction revenue as they want, through 'Fake Sales'.""  
  
And a seller in China reported on seeing phantom orders collecting their 0.6% cut for PDD, quoted in the Grizzly report: https://grizzlyreports.com/we-believe-pdd-is-a-dying-fraudulent-company-and-its-shopping-app-temu-is-cleverly-hidden-spyware-that-poses-an-urgent-security-threat-to-u-s-national-interests/ - ""There were also comments on the investment forum that one purported seller on the Pinduoduo platform observed that in the early morning and in the evening, a large number of orders would emerge from the back end of PDD, which would then be canceled. Even though those orders were canceled, Pinduoduo would still collect 0.6% of those payment transactions. It is unclear about the scale of these kinds of activities, but it gives the indication that large and repeating numbers of 'abnormal transactions' are part of the PDD culture.""  
  
\#2 - PDD's main reported revenues come from online marketing services, which is inflated both by insiders and outsiders  
  
Given the way they handle transaction revenue and market non-existent products, PDD is also directly misrepresenting their marketing revenue with ads from their own entities. There is also marketing and transaction volume from fake orders by third parties.  
  
Because PDD is focused on cheap white label mercandise, from many merchants with similar products, sellers seek to generate fake transaction volume, generating fees for PDD, that can help catapult their products to the top of the results: ""Based on our conversation with the order brushing 'expert', when people opened new shops on Pinduoduo’s platform, the owner of the shop could grant access to the order brushing expert. Depending on the terms set between two parties, for example, the new shop owner could ask for how many transactions happened during a certain time period, how many positive reviews that shop would receive, etc. The owner will need to pay fees to the order brushing expert, depending on the terms."" (from the Grizzly report)  
  
As to the economics of how it would make sense to generate all these fake orders, there is evidence of a link between ""brushing"" and money laundering: ""According to the article, two criminals controlled thousands of 'empty package' websites and there were about 600 million of these logistics orders \[for empty package\]. It was later found that these empty packages were actually used as the transaction payments of cross-border gambling. In early June \[2020\], police from Wuxi city arrested 40 people involved in 15 cities. The police from Wuxi compared those empty package order numbers and many of these orders appeared in two cross-border gambling money laundering cases with the total amount of funds of 7 Billion RMB.""  
  
\#3 - they have an undisclosed captive entity (Leqee), established by the founder of PDD, that allows them to underreport headcount, which was more than 4x what they put on financial statements  
  
Blue Orca Capital revealed this a while back: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a81b554be42d6b09e19fc09/t/5bec448e562fa7b00abd26f5/1542210719984/Blue+Orca+Short+Pinduoduo+Inc+%28NASDAQ+PDD%29.pdf  
  
Leqee put out job advertisements on behalf of PDD. Their own website contradicted their filings regarding headcount. Then they edited the website to reduce the number and match their filings.  
  
\#4 - accounting discrepancies overreport revenue and underreport losses significantly  
  
Also in the Blue Orca Capital report. Misrepresentation by 30% to 100% for important figures are estimated. This includes explicit misrepresentation on different financial reports, one from PDD, the two others from entities (VIE) that it controls. The difference is a discrepancy in revenue of 36% between those reports from PDD.  
  
\#5 - their prospectus states that they're counting unsold items as 'merchandise sold'  
  
So they intentionally inflate their figures. There's plenty of orders with unsold items, because anything that doesn't create a team purchase or anything just placed into the equivalent of a shopping cart gets counted as merchandise sold. This is to mislead an unskeptical investor about the volume of business at PDD.  
  
\#6 - they spun off the lucrative payments processing business with ownership by the executives, instead of rewarding the owners of PDD  
  
From the Grizzly report: ""Shanghai Fufeitong was formed to 'supplement' (e.g. 'displace') the payment services that Tencent has been providing to PDD. We believe the eventual goal for PDD is to use Shanghai Fufeitong to control and cash in on as much as possible of the payment transactions that Tencent is currently providing. ... This game of 'hide-the-ball' allows a large amount of the cash flow generated by TEMU to be siphoned off to TEMU executives with little to no oversight or financial accountability. This is a rerun of the AliPay playbook! ... Eventually shareholders found out that Alipay was worth hundreds of billions of USD, but they were not able to enjoy the fruits of that part of business as Alibaba’s shareholders. If you follow investing in Chinese companies, this sounds familiar!""  
  
\#7 - more accounting fraud and misrepresentation of revenue  
  
The Grizzly report also notes that the figures provided regarding payments revenue and transaction services show another likely instance of accounting fraud: ""How can PDD increase its transaction services revenue at a 95% annual rate, yet its transaction processing services received from its two main payment processing companies declined 10.6%? This just doesn’t make sense to us.""  
  
The Blue Orca report shows that PDD claims third party transaction revenue as part of its own revenue figures: ""PDD explicitly tells merchants that it collects no commissions, and that the 0.6% transaction fees are collected on behalf of third -party payment services such as WeChat Pay and Alipay. ... We think in this case that accounting rules clearly prohibit PDD from recognizing transaction fees collected on behalf of third parties on a gross basis. But that, it appears, is exactly what they do. ... This is material because it demonstrates PDD’s aggressive approach to accounting rules. It is also material because firms like PDD trade on a multiple of sales. Even if it is zero margin revenue, PDD can inflate its stock price by recording a higher top line.""  
  
\#8 - shenanigans regarding where billions in stock went  
  
From the same report: ""It was reported (Link) that the main reason for the shareholding decrease was that Chairman Huang donated many shares to different charities. However, the article below was questioning these donations because they were unable to find any information about those charity funds, either in Chinese or in English. ... The takeaway from all these sources is that the correct amount of Chairman Huang’s shareholding in PDD is undisclosed. That holding is worth appx $12 Billion USD in value, at the current price of PDD. Investors don’t know if Mr. Huang really owns those PDD shares, or perhaps he is just a proxy for another party or entity, be that PDD or an undisclosed person or entity. There’s no way to know whether whoever is controlling them is waiting for the right moment to dump these shares on the market.""  
  
\#9 - it's an open secret that nobody outside the company knows the real accounting numbers at PDD  
  
From the Grizzly report: ""Even the usually promotional sell side analysts have pointed out that PDD’s accounting is akin to a 'Black Box' as disclosure becomes ever more opaque. Despite being a company with a market cap of appx $135 billion, PDD has not had a CFO since 2018. The key financial positions are a revolving door. There seems to be no accountability. The local audit partners from Ernst&amp;Young Hua Ming LLP are in our judgment untrustworthy and have audited numerous Chinese companies whose shares have proven next to worthless in the past. ... There have been at least 3 people employed as VP of Finance since 2018, plus the company didn’t even have a VP of Finance (not to mention CFO) for over a year! How can any prudent investor trust the financials of a company which had this lack of financial oversight since the day it went public in 2018? This is governance worthy of a small-cap OTC company.""  
  
The report also notes: ""Ernst &amp; Young Hua Ming LLP has been PDD’s auditor since it went public in 2018. According to PCAOB, E&amp;Y Hua Ming’s Engagement Partner Wei Liu was in charge of PDD’s audit for the fiscal year 2021 and 2022, but before that, another engagement partner Congyue Song was in charge of the audit from 2018 to 2020. Through searching Wei Liu’s audit history, it can be found that Wei Liu only audited another China-based company LightinTheBox (NYSE: LITB) from 2019 and 2020. Congyue Song was in charge of 21Vianet Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: VNET) from 2016 to 2018, Molecular Data Inc. (OTC: MKDTY) from 2018 to 2019, and BEST Inc. (NYSE: BEST) from 2019 to 2022."" All of the companies audited by these firms have lost more than 90% in shareholder value.  
  
\#10 - growth in China has stalled  
  
PDD in China initially gained users from marketing and 'subsidies', which operated at a loss, and from an initial wave of people recruiting peers for deals (also at a loss with promotional freebies). It benefited from the regulatory action against Alibaba, which constrained their marketing spend. PDD is now in a weak position in China, unable to keep operating at a loss and under increased competition from Alibaba and JD. It's now reporting a profit, but it's hiding key numbers on market share and growth.  
  
PDD stopped reporting many different relevant figures during 2021 and 2022: ""GMV, active monthly active users, active buyers in the twelve-month period, annual spending per active buyer in the twelve-month period."" Not reporting the figures is both another indictment of the culture at PDD and of the veracity of their recent growth in China.  
  
The Grizzly report mentions: ""PDD’s quarterly averaged DAU has taken a big drop in Q2 2023. Because in the article, PDD’s estimated DAU in the month of March should be about 354 million (=380m – 26m), but for Q2 2023, the quarterly averaged DAU is only 238 million. There seems to be over 100 million DAU drop from Q1 2023 to Q2 2023. As we just mentioned, different analytic companies might have slightly different numbers when calculating DAU, but we do not believe a difference of over 100 million can be attributed to this. The trend is clear: PDD is sliding while Taobao is gaining ground. ... The decline in PDD's DAU has also been corroborated by some other sources. For example, an account on Snowball (a popular and widely used investor forum) posted a screenshot of a part of Goldman Sachs research report from July 19th 2023, which shows that PDD’s DAU in month of June 2023 'continues to decline at -21% YoY post its app version update'. ... In addition, this article ( Link ) also shows that both Taobao and JD have positive year-over-year growth in their DAUs since February 2023. Yet PDD’s DAU growth rate kept decreasing since February 2023 and its year-over-year growth rate reached over 20% decrease in month of June.""  
  
\#11 - TEMU props up the share price as it sinks the company  
  
Just when it needs to defend its position in China, PDD is operating at an enormous loss to expand internationally. This is costing the company across several fronts: online advertising to acquire users and bring them back to the app, promotional freebies given to users, taking orders at tiny receipt sizes despite all the costs of processing an order, and of course paying for shipping by air. This might even be a decent strategy, in spite of generating massive losses, if it could be turned into a profitable segment of the business.  
  
As reported in this article - https://www.wired.com/story/temu-is-losing-millions-of-dollars-to-send-you-cheap-socks/ - ""In the US, most of Temu’s subsidies come in the form of free international shipping. WIRED looked at multiple analyses of shipping costs, including data from financial research company Haitong International Securities Group, which suggests that the cost of shipping even a small package from Guangzhou, where Temu has its warehouses, to the US is around $14. Haitong’s analysis—confirmed by the Temu insider—shows that J&amp;T Express, the company’s logistics partner, bears some of the costs, but that Temu is on the hook for $9 or $10 per shipment. ... J&amp;T Express is due to go public soon. Analysts say the company has also been subsidizing its own clients to build its market share, but, once public, may need to reduce its incentives to improve its own profitability, with a knock-on impact on Temu’s costs. ... Taking into account other costs beyond shipping—including discounts and cash coupons that Temu gives to customers, and service and administrative costs—the average amount that Temu loses on each order to the US is around $30. These figures were confirmed by the company insider, who, speaking on condition of anonymity, says that the company’s long-term target is for Americans to purchase 30 times per year from Temu, with an average order size of $50, meaning each user spends on average $1,500 a year.""  
  
There's already a company that Americans use to purchase 30+ times a year, one of the world's most valuable brands, with higher quality products, a higher average order size, and exceptional logistics providing extremely fast shipping that is ""free"" -- obviously, that's Amazon.  
  
It's impossible for a company on the other side of the world, without the logistics network, built on the back of freebies and cheap stuff to get there. As soon as the 'subsidies', freebies, and marketing spend punch bowl goes away, the TEMU app becomes less and less relevant to American consumers. If customers in China are fickle about their platform of choice for cheap stuff with goofy marketing, Americans will be even less interested in this second rate company and its third rate products, with a quickness.  
  
\#12 - unsustainable business models, rewarding insiders, and fraudulent accounting are all from the same playbook  
  
The cases of accounting fraud are too many to list them all. Luckin Coffee is a famous one. The goal is to defraud the investor.  
  
The cases of rewarding insiders at the expense of the company are also common. PDD's payment company carve-out is a repeat of AliPay in destroying shareholder value.  
  
The cases of unsustainable business models are found everywhere, but you'd think maybe people would see it when it's ""the same picture."" The TEMU app and wish.com will have the same fate. This has propelled PDD to its highest market cap yet, all on the tale of an e-commerce company with unprecedented growth. Short-term growth that comes by borrowing from tomorrow, impairing whatever long term value could have been built instead.  
  
An evident motive for the management at PDD is to enrich a few at the expense of those investing in the stock. Are you buying it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDD engages in accounting fraud and is less profitable than it claims.

&lt;p&gt;From the Grizzly report: &amp;quot;Shanghai Fufeitong was formed to &amp;#39;supplement&amp;#39; (e.g. &amp;#39;displace&amp;#39;) the payment services that Tencent has been providing to PDD. We believe the eventual goal for PDD is to use Shanghai Fufeitong to control and cash in on as much as possible of the payment transactions that Tencent is currently providing. ... This game of &amp;#39;hide-the-ball&amp;#39; allows a large amount of the cash flow generated by TEMU to be siphoned off to TEMU executives with little to no oversight or financial accountability. This is a rerun of the AliPay playbook! ... Eventually shareholders found out that Alipay was worth hundreds of billions of USD, but they were not able to enjoy the fruits of that part of business as Alibaba’s shareholders. If you follow investing in Chinese companies, this sounds familiar!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#7 - more accounting fraud and misrepresentation of revenue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Grizzly report also notes that the figures provided regarding payments revenue and transaction services show another likely instance of accounting fraud: &amp;quot;How can PDD increase its transaction services revenue at a 95% annual rate, yet its transaction processing services received from its two main payment processing companies declined 10.6%? This just doesn’t make sense to us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blue Orca report shows that PDD claims third party transaction revenue as part of its own revenue figures: &amp;quot;PDD explicitly tells merchants that it collects no commissions, and that the 0.6% transaction fees are collected on behalf of third -party payment services such as WeChat Pay and Alipay. ... We think in this case that accounting rules clearly prohibit PDD from recognizing transaction fees collected on behalf of third parties on a gross basis. But that, it appears, is exactly what they do. ... This is material because it demonstrates PDD’s aggressive approach to accounting rules. It is also material because firms like PDD trade on a multiple of sales. Even if it is zero margin revenue, PDD can inflate its stock price by recording a higher top line.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#8 - shenanigans regarding where billions in stock went&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the same report: &amp;quot;It was reported (Link) that the main reason for the shareholding decrease was that Chairman Huang donated many shares to different charities. However, the article below was questioning these donations because they were unable to find any information about those charity funds, either in Chinese or in English. ... The takeaway from all these sources is that the correct amount of Chairman Huang’s shareholding in PDD is undisclosed. That holding is worth appx $12 Billion USD in value, at the current price of PDD. Investors don’t know if Mr. Huang really owns those PDD shares, or perhaps he is just a proxy for another party or entity, be that PDD or an undisclosed person or entity. There’s no way to know whether whoever is controlling them is waiting for the right moment to dump these shares on the market.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#9 - it&amp;#39;s an open secret that nobody outside the company knows the real accounting numbers at PDD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Grizzly report: &amp;quot;Even the usually promotional sell side analysts have pointed out that PDD’s accounting is akin to a &amp;#39;Black Box&amp;#39; as disclosure becomes ever more opaque. Despite being a company with a market cap of appx $135 billion, PDD has not had a CFO since 2018. The key financial positions are a revolving door. There seems to be no accountability. The local audit partners from Ernst&amp;amp;Young Hua Ming LLP are in our judgment untrustworthy and have audited numerous Chinese companies whose shares have proven next to worthless in the past. ... There have been at least 3 people employed as VP of Finance since 2018, plus the company didn’t even have a VP of Finance (not to mention CFO) for over a year! How can any prudent investor trust the financials of a company which had this lack of financial oversight since the day it went public in 2018? This is governance worthy of a small-cap OTC company.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also notes: &amp;quot;Ernst &amp;amp; Young Hua Ming LLP has been PDD’s auditor since it went public in 2018. According to PCAOB, E&amp;amp;Y Hua Ming’s Engagement Partner Wei Liu was in charge of PDD’s audit for the fiscal year 2021 and 2022, but before that, another engagement partner Congyue Song was in charge of the audit from 2018 to 2020. Through searching Wei Liu’s audit history, it can be found that Wei Liu only audited another China-based company LightinTheBox (NYSE: LITB) from 2019 and 2020. Congyue Song was in charge of 21Vianet Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: VNET) from 2016 to 2018, Molecular Data Inc. (OTC: MKDTY) from 2018 to 2019, and BEST Inc. (NYSE: BEST) from 2019 to 2022.&amp;quot; All of the companies audited by these firms have lost more than 90% in shareholder value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#10 - growth in China has stalled&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PDD in China initially gained users from marketing and &amp;#39;subsidies&amp;#39;, which operated at a loss, and from an initial wave of people recruiting peers for deals (also at a loss with promotional freebies). It benefited from the regulatory action against Alibaba, which constrained their marketing spend. PDD is now in a weak position in China, unable to keep operating at a loss and under increased competition from Alibaba and JD. It&amp;#39;s now reporting a profit, but it&amp;#39;s hiding key numbers on market share and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PDD stopped reporting many different relevant figures during 2021 and 2022: &amp;quot;GMV, active monthly active users, active buyers in the twelve-month period, annual spending per active buyer in the twelve-month period.&amp;quot; Not reporting the figures is both another indictment of the culture at PDD and of the veracity of their recent growth in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Grizzly report mentions: &amp;quot;PDD’s quarterly averaged DAU has taken a big drop in Q2 2023. Because in the article, PDD’s estimated DAU in the month of March should be about 354 million (=380m – 26m), but for Q2 2023, the quarterly averaged DAU is only 238 million. There seems to be over 100 million DAU drop from Q1 2023 to Q2 2023. As we just mentioned, different analytic companies might have slightly different numbers when calculating DAU, but we do not believe a difference of over 100 million can be attributed to this. The trend is clear: PDD is sliding while Taobao is gaining ground. ... The decline in PDD&amp;#39;s DAU has also been corroborated by some other sources. For example, an account on Snowball (a popular and widely used investor forum) posted a screenshot of a part of Goldman Sachs research report from July 19th 2023, which shows that PDD’s DAU in month of June 2023 &amp;#39;continues to decline at -21% YoY post its app version update&amp;#39;. ... In addition, this article ( Link ) also shows that both Taobao and JD have positive year-over-year growth in their DAUs since February 2023. Yet PDD’s DAU growth rate kept decreasing since February 2023 and its year-over-year growth rate reached over 20% decrease in month of June.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#11 - TEMU props up the share price as it sinks the company&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just when it needs to defend its position in China, PDD is operating at an enormous loss to expand internationally. This is costing the company across several fronts: online advertising to acquire users and bring them back to the app, promotional freebies given to users, taking orders at tiny receipt sizes despite all the costs of processing an order, and of course paying for shipping by air. This might even be a decent strategy, in spite of generating massive losses, if it could be turned into a profitable segment of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported in this article - &lt;a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/temu-is-losing-millions-of-dollars-to-send-you-cheap-socks/""&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/temu-is-losing-millions-of-dollars-to-send-you-cheap-socks/&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;quot;In the US, most of Temu’s subsidies come in the form of free international shipping. WIRED looked at multiple analyses of shipping costs, including data from financial research company Haitong International Securities Group, which suggests that the cost of shipping even a small package from Guangzhou, where Temu has its warehouses, to the US is around $14. Haitong’s analysis—confirmed by the Temu insider—shows that J&amp;amp;T Express, the company’s logistics partner, bears some of the costs, but that Temu is on the hook for $9 or $10 per shipment. ... J&amp;amp;T Express is due to go public soon. Analysts say the company has also been subsidizing its own clients to build its market share, but, once public, may need to reduce its incentives to improve its own profitability, with a knock-on impact on Temu’s costs. ... Taking into account other costs beyond shipping—including discounts and cash coupons that Temu gives to customers, and service and administrative costs—the average amount that Temu loses on each order to the US is around $30. These figures were confirmed by the company insider, who, speaking on condition of anonymity, says that the company’s long-term target is for Americans to purchase 30 times per year from Temu, with an average order size of $50, meaning each user spends on average $1,500 a year.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s already a company that Americans use to purchase 30+ times a year, one of the world&amp;#39;s most valuable brands, with higher quality products, a higher average order size, and exceptional logistics providing extremely fast shipping that is &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; -- obviously, that&amp;#39;s Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s impossible for a company on the other side of the world, without the logistics network, built on the back of freebies and cheap stuff to get there. As soon as the &amp;#39;subsidies&amp;#39;, freebies, and marketing spend punch bowl goes away, the TEMU app becomes less and less relevant to American consumers. If customers in China are fickle about their platform of choice for cheap stuff with goofy marketing, Americans will be even less interested in this second rate company and its third rate products, with a quickness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#12 - unsustainable business models, rewarding insiders, and fraudulent accounting are all from the same playbook&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases of accounting fraud are too many to list them all. Luckin Coffee is a famous one. The goal is to defraud the investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases of rewarding insiders at the expense of the company are also common. PDD&amp;#39;s payment company carve-out is a repeat of AliPay in destroying shareholder value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases of unsustainable business models are found everywhere, but you&amp;#39;d think maybe people would see it when it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;the same picture.&amp;quot; The TEMU app and wish.com will have the same fate. This has propelled PDD to its highest market cap yet, all on the tale of an e-commerce company with unprecedented growth. Short-term growth that comes by borrowing from tomorrow, impairing whatever long term value could have been built instead.&lt;/p&gt;

More than a day into the United Auto Workers strike against the Detroit automakers and one thing is clear: Elon Musk has already won.

And the billionaire tycoon isn’t even involved. 

Musk won before the strike began early Friday. He won before negotiations started two months ago. From the get-go, General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis were expected to spend more on wages because of the union’s pressure. The question is just how much of an increase, and so far their offers haven’t pleased the union, igniting this past week’s work stoppage.

**Whatever happens, more money surely will be spent. Any wage increase further advances Tesla’s already tremendous cost advantage in EVs over its older U.S. peers, which are contending with generations of legacy expenses while trying to steer a costly transition to electric from gas-powered vehicles.**

In March, Musk revealed plans to build on his advantage by setting a goal of slashing manufacturing costs for the automaker’s next-generation vehicles by 50%, an ambitious agenda that will depend upon advanced automation, savvy engineering and other changes. 

The Tesla chief executive’s actions this year have shown how Tesla can take advantage of a lower cost structure to engage in price wars with rivals around the world to juice sales.

In July, Tesla reported second-quarter profit that rose 20% even after reducing prices. Around the same time, in the midst of steep losses from its electric vehicles, Ford said it would slow its EV production growth. 

All of this is playing out as the UAW seeks more than what the Detroit automakers say they can afford and remain competitive. The companies have offered wage increases of varying sizes reaching as high as 20% over four years, while UAW President Shawn Fain countered with a mid-30% increase, down from a previous ask of at least 40%. 

**The Detroit companies’ labor costs, including wages and benefits, are estimated at an average of $66 an hour, according to industry data. That compares with $45 at Tesla, which isn’t unionized and was founded 20 years ago. Meeting all of Fain’s initial demands would boost average hourly labor costs to $136 for the Detroit companies, Wells Fargo estimated.**

A key difference between Tesla’s compensation plan and that of the UAW workers revolves around company upside. UAW workers have been getting profit-sharing bonuses while Tesla workers receive stock options, which don’t have a direct cash cost to the company. Over the years, Tesla shares have risen like a rocket, though there have been periods of turbulence. Shares this year have more than doubled.

Fain argues that past contracts haven’t kept up with inflation, hurting the union’s roughly 146,000 auto workers’ spending power, and that members’ sacrifices have helped make the companies profitable in recent years. 

**“This is our generation’s defining moment,” Fain said late Thursday before the walkout. “The money is there. The cause is righteous.”**

Shortly afterward, Ford responded, saying the union’s demands would “more than double Ford’s current UAW-related labor costs, which are already significantly higher than the labor costs of Tesla, Toyota and other foreign-owned automakers in the United States that utilize non-union-represented labor.”

Many analysts, so far, are expecting that the Detroit companies will ultimately absorb the added costs. “The much larger issue is that it adds incremental pressure to their already challenged transition to an EV world,” Dan Levy, an analyst for Barclays, cautioned investors in a recent note 

Fain this past week sounded annoyed when asked about Tesla’s cost advantage. 

“Competition is code word for race to the bottom, and I’m not concerned about Elon Musk building more rocket ships so he can fly in outer space and stuff,” Fain told CNBC on-air Wednesday. “Our concern is working-class people need their share of economic justice in this world.”

Focus on the labor-cost gap is a classic part of Detroit negotiations—raised by executives, investors and analysts every cycle. Before Tesla, there was Toyota Motor and its nonunion pay rates. 

U.S. automakers spent years arguing that Asian rivals, without UAW contracts, benefited from cheaper labor costs that allowed them to plow savings into cars that appealed to consumers. 

Narrowing the labor-cost gap was a key part of the painful restructuring of the auto industry around 15 years ago, when union members made unprecedented concessions to help save their employers and their jobs. 

Art Wheaton, a labor expert at Cornell University, suggests that the UAW’s ability to get higher wages could help put heat on Tesla during any renewed effort to organize there.

“I don’t think Elon Musk has all of that superwonderful, high-polished glow anymore,” he said, noting the controversies the billionaire has had regarding his recent ownership of Twitter-turned-X. “Some of that patina has been wiped clean.”

The UAW had its best shot in years to organize Tesla during labor strife in 2017 and 2018, when workers were feeling the burn of “production hell” at what was then the automaker’s lone assembly plant outside San Francisco as it struggled with the Model 3 sedan.

But the organizing effort failed.

The National Labor Relations Board has ruled that Tesla violated U.S. labor law in its handling of the matter, including statements by Musk that were considered threatening when he tweeted that hourly workers would lose stock options if they joined the UAW. An appeal by the company, which has denied wrongdoing, is pending. 

Musk has suggested that employee stock options make his factory workers the highest compensated in the industry, saying “quite a few” line workers have become “millionaires over the years from company stock grants.” Options allow workers to buy stock at a certain price after working at the company for a set amount of time. 

At Tesla, the average pay for a manufacturing technician can range from $23 to $32 an hour, according to estimates by Glassdoor. Tesla advertises factory jobs in California with expected pay ranging from $24 to $67 an hour plus cash and stock awards and other benefits. 

On Thursday, Musk took another jab at the UAW, after essentially daring the union last year to try again to organize his workers, boasting that his factories “have a great vibe.”

“We encourage playing music and having some fun. Very important for people to look forward to coming to work!” he tweeted recently. “We pay more than the UAW btw, but performance expectations are also higher.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tickers mentioned: GM, F, STLA, TSLA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAW had its best shot in years to organize Tesla during labor strife in 2017 and 2018, when workers were feeling the burn of “production hell” at what was then the automaker’s lone assembly plant outside San Francisco as it struggled with the Model 3 sedan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the organizing effort failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Labor Relations Board has ruled that Tesla violated U.S. labor law in its handling of the matter, including statements by Musk that were considered threatening when he tweeted that hourly workers would lose stock options if they joined the UAW. An appeal by the company, which has denied wrongdoing, is pending. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk has suggested that employee stock options make his factory workers the highest compensated in the industry, saying “quite a few” line workers have become “millionaires over the years from company stock grants.” Options allow workers to buy stock at a certain price after working at the company for a set amount of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Tesla, the average pay for a manufacturing technician can range from $23 to $32 an hour, according to estimates by Glassdoor. Tesla advertises factory jobs in California with expected pay ranging from $24 to $67 an hour plus cash and stock awards and other benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Musk took another jab at the UAW, after essentially daring the union last year to try again to organize his workers, boasting that his factories “have a great vibe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We encourage playing music and having some fun. Very important for people to look forward to coming to work!” he tweeted recently. “We pay more than the UAW btw, but performance expectations are also higher.”&lt;/p&gt;

I have been holding some Petroleo Brasileiro (ADR) for quite a while now. And my newest dividend payments all include a withholding tax somehow. 

I have read that for Brazilian shares there is no withholding tax.

Am I paying that tax to the US because it’s an ADR ? And if so, shouldn’t I just switch to the non ADR one?

Why is it being deducted now and not before ? I have received many dividends from them and none had a tax on it.

## Mild Reception for iPhone 15

Even the most avid iPhone users appear somewhat unimpressed with the latest features. The question that looms is whether Apple has reached a plateau in terms of smartphone innovation. After all, how much better can a phone camera get? Is faster processing power enough to justify upgrading?

## AAPL Stock in Rough Waters

The stock has been wobbly, and many are wondering if a market correction is overdue. The high valuation of AAPL stock might seem unwarranted based on current product releases. So, should investors cut and run or stick around for the next big thing?

While it's easy to focus on tangible products, let's not forget Apple's potential in software and services. Rumors of significant Siri improvements and the much-talked-about LLm feature could turn the tide for the tech giant.

85,stocks,"This is Stocks, would like to see discussion outside of tech and ETFs. I'd like to try to identify smaller companies with long term potential, there's a few which am considering investing for next decade. Here's few ideas which've found, do you have any feedback or similar ideas?

1. NU is fast growing bank coming out of Brazil, was bought by Warren Buffet who's still holding. Bought when was $10-$12 so at even better price than what Buffet paid. They're expanding to Mexico, just realized wife got one of their cards few months back so they're expanding and are growing profits each quarter. 35b market cap.
2. COCO is the maker of Vita Coco which is sold in Costco. Have seen loyal fanbase swear by this drink after researching about it. Lately, have been seeing Coconut water is on the rise.  Just saw documentary of fast growing export from countries like Sri Lanka. With 1.6b market cap, am thinking this company could be bought out in the future and Coconut water is growing trend.
3. BRZE Braze company is interesting, helps companies push notifications to their customers through various platforms and is introducing AI generative marketing based off data collected from customers. CFO says will be profitable by 2024 Q4. 4b market cap, operates with subscription based model and growing rapidly their accounts with $500k+ subscription.
4. SOFI bank is another interesting pick, not because Reddit but actually seeing commercials for this bank and is reaching me by actual marketing efforts now so real world implications. 8b market cap, chase bank is 440b so even x10 is still just 80b market cap which is more realistic imo if growth continues. Younger audience which supposedly will grow into their wealth.

I'm not considering buy now, when fear and greed index takes another nose dive and another crisis starts I'd like to then DCA into these companies. The most famous art dealers will buy hundreds of paintings and hold long term, it's only a handful which actually explode immensely in value.

Rational is don't need to get everything right, but finding a 10x with a company near 5b market cap is more realistic imo than expecting Apple to x10 with current 2.7t market cap.

-----------------

Fast-food workers in California are set to receive pay hikes next year after the restaurant industry and unions reached a compromise over a controversial bill.

The deal, brokered with the help of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office, also creates a nine-person council that will decide on future wage hikes for the fast-food industry in California through 2029. The agreement ends a fight between the two sides that threatened to stretch out for years. The restaurant industry was gearing up to spend more than $100 million on the battle.

The deal will mean a wage floor of $20 for California workers at fast-food chains with at least 60 locations nationwide, starting April 1. And from 2025 through 2029, the appointed council will have the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually by whichever is lower: 3.5% or the annual change in the consumer price index.

The council will include four representatives from the fast-food industry, four from the workers’ side and one neutral party who will serve as chair.

While fast-food operators will have to cope with paying higher wages, the agreement thwarts more dire consequences, according to industry analysts.

“I certainly wouldn’t say it’s catastrophic, and certainly not as bad as it could have played out over the next year or two,” said Mark Kalinowski, CEO of Kalinowski Equity Research.

California lawmakers rushed to conclude the matter before the legislative session ends midnight Friday. The state senate passed the bill Thursday, and the state assembly has concurred with the upper house’s amendments. Newsom, a Democrat, has already pledged to sign the bill into law.

**California’s fast-food fight**

Newsom signed AB 257, also known as the FAST Act, into law in January. The legislation would have created a 10-person council that would govern fast-food chains with more than 60 locations, including setting guidelines for working conditions and wages. The initial wage hike could have been as high as $22 an hour.

But the fast-food industry was attacking the bill before it even made its way to Newsom’s desk. State records show that Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chick-fil-A, Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International were among the chains that spent money to lobby California lawmakers to oppose the legislation.

McDonald’s U.S. President Joe Erlinger wrote a letter posted on the company’s website, making a rare public statement on a political issue. Erlinger called the bill “lopsided” and “ill-considered,” attacking lawmakers for not targeting all restaurants. As of 2022, just under 10% of McDonald’s U.S. restaurants were located in California, according to Citi Research. Most are run by franchisees.

The restaurant industry retaliated, gathering enough signatures to create a referendum that would make California’s voters decide on the matter. The Service Employees International Union, which backed the FAST Act, alleged in a lawsuit that the industry misled signatories, but a judge ruled against the union. The referendum was supposed to be on November 2024 ballots.

In response to the referendum, the SEIU backed another bill, AB 1228. The bill would impose joint-employer liability on franchised businesses — including the very restaurant chains that loudly decried AB 257.

Under the bill, franchisors like McDonald’s would be held liable for infractions committed by their franchisees. Opponents said that the bill attacked the very nature of the franchising model. AB 1228′s provisions were originally included in AB 257 but removed before Newsom signed it into law.

The California State Assembly passed AB 1228 in early June. But the state’s Senate never had the chance to vote on that version.

Instead, the restaurant industry and the unions struck a deal, replacing the joint-employer provisions with the terms of their agreement, which also includes repealing the FAST Act and withdrawing the referendum by Jan. 1.

**What’s next for workers?**

Fast-food workers employed by affected restaurants will see pay increases of as much as 25% hit their paychecks starting in April. The current California minimum wage is $15.50 an hour, with a bump to $16 set for January.

Employees of smaller fast-food joints and other restaurants could also reap some benefits from the legislation.

“When you look at the $20 minimum wage, that’s a bar that’s being set,” Joe Pawlak, managing principal of restaurant consulting firm Technomic, told CNBC. “That’s going to make the restaurant industry a lot more competitive for employees, so other industries are going to have to also step up.”

In recent years, Amazon warehouses and retailers like Walmart and Target have lured workers away with higher hourly pay. Now they’ll be forced to compete with fast-food chains, which have traditionally been slower to raise wages due to operators’ razor-thin margins.

Other states, like Minnesota or New York, could also follow California’s lead and craft similar councils to govern restaurants or other industries, Pawlak said.

″[The deal] puts a model in place with a structure that everybody is able to digest,” he said.

Still, labor’s side had to make some trade-offs to get the deal in California. One key concession is that the council won’t have the power to set working conditions. Instead, the Fast Food Council will only be able to recommend proposed standards to state agencies.

But that doesn’t mean that unions won’t keep trying to push for better conditions.

“Fast-food workers’ fight in California isn’t close to over — it has only just begun as they prepare to take their seat at the table and help transform their industry for the better,” SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said in a statement to CNBC.

**What does it mean for restaurants?**

Faced with a mandate to pay higher wages, fast-food operators will have to decide how they plan to deal with elevated labor costs. Some may raise menu prices, although customers may balk at having to foot the bill. Others may try to make do with fewer workers on hand or to invest in automation to handle more tasks.

But it’s not all gloomy for restaurants.

“This agreement protects local restaurant owners from significant threats that would have made it difficult to continue to operate in California. It provides a more predictable and stable future for restaurants, workers, and consumers,” Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs at the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement.

The chief uncertainty resolved by the deal is the referendum slated for November 2024 ballots. The industry had already spent more than $64 million on the referendum, according to California records, and was preparing to spend much more. But it would be difficult to predict which side voters would take.

″[The agreement] shows just how concerned the industry was,” Kalinowski said. “The referendum would have been very challenging, to have it come out their way.”

On top of that, restaurant chains like In-N-Out now save some cash that otherwise would have gone toward the industry’s war chest.

The deal also avoids the change to joint-employer liability that was feared by the broader franchising industry.

“This allows the franchise model to exist,” said Dana Kravetz, a Los Angeles-based labor attorney at Michelman &amp; Robinson.

Fast-food companies with heavily franchised footprints, like McDonald’s, KFC, Taco Bell and Domino’s Pizza, will largely escape the effects of the bill, unless they have company-owned locations in California.

Instead, their franchisees will have to grapple with how to pay higher wages. The National Owners Association, an independent advocacy group of McDonald’s franchisees, plans to push back. In a memo viewed by CNBC, the NOA projects the bill will cost each restaurant in the state $250,000 annually.

Restaurant companies that don’t franchise will have to foot the bill for increased labor costs themselves. That includes Chipotle Mexican Grill, which has 457 locations — or 14% of its total footprint — in its home state of California.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/15/california-fast-food-minimum-wage-deal-what-to-know.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/15/california-fast-food-minimum-wage-deal-what-to-know.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

# INTRODUCTION:

SPOT has become the largest music streaming platform in the market even outperforming platforms backed by giants such as Apple or Amazon. SPOT users swear by the personalized selection given by SPOT and how seamless their music listening experience is with spotify connect. But, the path to capitalizing on all this for SPOT is a murky one which I’m skeptical SPOT is capable of reaching.   
  
As a general guideline for my forecast, I followed what management laid out in the 2022 investor day where SPOT expects to continue investing in podcasting and audio books, in the short run focus on improving Monthly Active Users(MAUs) rather than Average Revenue Per User(ARPU). The end goal by 2030 should be 1 Billion MAUs and $100 ARPU.   


# REVENUE:

  
The main concern I have with SPOT is their piracy issue. Piracy is still very easily conducted, it could be as simple as turning on an ad blocker or installing the “Cracked” version of SPOT on Android ([SOURCE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/x8ri64/the_ultimate_spotify_ad_blocking_guide_windows/))  
  
Piracy is an ailment of every service, it cannot be eradicated completely. For SPOT to put a meaningful end to Piracy the benefit (Convenience) and cost of SPOT (Legality, Financially and Restrictions) has to far outweigh the cost of Piracy (Risk, Time and Effort).   
  
To quote Gabe Newell the founder of Steam, a platform that distributes video games.   
“Piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem. If a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24 x 7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says the product is region-locked, will come to your country 3 months after the US release, and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store, then the pirate's service is more valuable.""  
  
I believe that SPOT is cheap enough for a monthly subscription and the value of the service far outweighs the cost of piracy. So, when forecasting revenue I’ll assume that Piracy is not a significant factor/consideration that will affect MAU and in turn affect revenue.  
  
When forecasting MAU, I’ll assume churn is not a significant factor based on management's statement, “Year-over-year churn, though, was pretty consistent with where it was at this point last year. So even with the strong growth, we're not seeing any uptick in churn at all.” - Q4 2022 Earnings conference. As SPOT is in the process of rolling out and expanding on their new offerings like Audiobook and Podcast, I’ll assume MAU grows at historic rates as there are a lot of low hanging fruits to pick off at the start of the implementation. Based on 2022 Investor Day, SPOT is expecting a CAGR of 9.4% for the next 7 years.   
  
When forecasting MAU conversion rate, I’ll assume that users have to try the service for a bit before deciding whether to take up SPOT’s services or not. So the conversion rate climbs steadily before holding constant at perpetuity, as there is always a group of consumers whose needs/situation makes subscribing to SPOT not attractive enough.  
  
  
  
When forecasting ARPU, the rationale for the first few years of forecast is slow and meager Y/Y growth based on management’s statement, “we're mostly focused on growth. So that's our general approach.” - Q4 2022 Earnings Conference. During the high growth period, as SPOT is more focused on gaining new MAU they will raise prices at very meager rates before switching to monetizing mode when new features are fully established. But because SPOT is very careful about raising prices too much as they are worried that will drive MAU towards rival products, the overall CAGR is held at about 2% for my entire forecast period.  
  
When forecasting Advertising revenue, SPOT plans on using Audiobooks, Podcast to increase advertising spend to improve advertising revenue. Rationale for this is that by giving larger audio offerings means MAU spends longer on the platform allowing for SPOT to earn more advertising revenue. But, as these offerings are quite new there isn’t much reliable historic data to base the Y/Y growth rate off. So, opting for less granularity. The growth rate of advertising revenue is pegged to growth rate of ad-supported MAU as management showed in 2022 investor presentation that Ad-supported MAU had a direct correlation with Ad revenue. Overall, it had a CAGR of about 6%.  


# COST:

Cost of revenue is mainly consisting of Royalty and Distribution cost. I doubt that SPOT has much room to reduce Royalty as the terms set up by record labels against SPOT are predatory in nature. With monthly payment of royalty from SPOT, certain of these royalty payments are required to be paid upfront in advance or SPOT has to give them a guaranteed minimum royalty. On top of that, certain licensors have a “Most Favored Nation” Clause which is a clause stating that if other licensors perform better than the licensor with the clause, SPOT has to make up the difference. All these Predatory terms ensure that SPOT will always have to burn a hole in its pocket first before it can even start paying downwards to other aspects of the business e.g. R&amp;D. SPOT can’t do anything about it as the big 3 music licensing can just refuse to license their music to SPOT.   
“increase in Premium cost of revenue was driven primarily by increases in new Premium Subscribers, publishing licensing rates”.   
  
When forecasting cost of revenue, some drag on gross margin is experienced as SPOT recently started investing in podcasts which they expect drag to be lifted by 2023 as per 2022 Q4 Earnings Conference. However, as licensing agencies have SPOT at a chokehold, I’ll assume that the needle doesn't shift very much. Cost of revenue holds at historical rates.  
  
  
When forecasting Marketing and R&amp;D, as it’s unpredictable how management will make operating decisions and what to invest in moving forward. I’ll use historic to avoid being overly granular.  
  
When forecasting G&amp;A, as management recently had a layoff I’ll assume that G&amp;A spend remains at historic levels before tapering downwards.  


# CHANGE IN NWC:

When forecasting change in NWC, I made sure to take the historic of the past 4 years. Only the past 4 years was used as SPOT intrinsically changed since 2018, moving past just being a music only business into Audiobooks and Podcasts which may affect Day Receivables and Payables.

# CAPEX &amp; D&amp;A:

CapEX only took into account purchase of physical buildings which I thought was not meaningful in helping to expand SPOT. So, opting for less granularity I assumed historic CapEX and D&amp;A.  
  


# WACC:

  
***Cost of Equity***  
RFR (1M Avg) = 2.81%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPOT/)) = 1.73  
ERP = Unable to find any reliable analyst’s forecast for ERP, the next best alternative is to take US stable market ERP.  
ERP = 6.48%  
COE = 9.16%  
  
***Cost of Debt***  
SPOT has no bond rating so the next best thing to take is a synthetic rating. But SPOT has been mostly EBIT negative for the past 5 years so we’re unable to take a synthetic rating. As SPOT has no actual bond yield, the next best thing we can do is to take book yield.  
Book Interest Expense = 132M + 53M = 185M  
Book Debt = 1683M  
Book Yield = 11.0%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 20.6%  
AT Book Yield = 8.73%  
  
***Weightage***  
Price (5D Avg) = $157.56  
Shares O/S = 193M  
Market Value of Equity = 30409M  
%Equity = 94.8%  
%Debt = 5.2%  
WACC = 9.14%  


# CONCLUSION:

At base case, I value SPOT at $164.55. I believe that SPOT's future is determined by how much they can break free from the music licensors or whether competitors will find any way to regain the upper hand against SPOT. The advantage that SPOT has is personalized music and spotify connect which competitors could make use of existing AI technology to replicate or create an interchangeable system that allows for cross play on different platforms. The future of SPOT is very volatile with my worst case at $39.47 and best case at $357.93 as their future is very reliant on external unpredictable factors. Due to how volatile it is and with negative earnings historically even a sanity check to find ROIC may not add much to accuracy.

Beginner with individual stocks here.

ADBE's Overall financials look super good in my eyes (growth in free cash flow, revenue etc) and I attempted a simple DCF calculation based on that.

My estimated growth is 14% on it's FCF, and a WAAC of 8%, I ended up with a fair value of $630, which is obviously well above it's current price (pre-market around$635). The current price allows for a margin of 15% which makes me wonder if ADBE at its current price might be attractive to enter a small position.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Sept 14 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM.N) said Thursday it upped its contract offer to a 20% wage hike for U.S. autoworkers - including 10% in the first year - in a bid to avoid a strike that is set to begin at 11:59 p.m. if no deal is reached.

The targeted actions against selected auto plants would be the United Auto Workers' first-ever simultaneous strike against the Detroit Three carmakers.

""We are working with urgency and have proposed yet another increasingly strong offer with the goal of reaching an agreement tonight,"" GM CEO Mary Barra told employees of its proposal for the 4 1/2 year labor deal. ""Remember: we had a strike in 2019 and nobody won.""



GM reported a $3.6 billion pre-tax loss in 2019 after the 42-day walkout.

Coordinated strikes would represent arguably the most ambitious U.S. labor action in decades and could impact U.S. economic growth, depending how long they last.

The UAW has outlined plans for a series of strikes targeting individual, undisclosed U.S. auto plants if agreements are not reached by late Thursday, rather than a full walkout.

UAW organizing director Brian O. Shepherd said in an online event Thursday the strike strategy is to give ""negotiators maximum flexibility"" to get autoworkers ""the contract they deserve."" He added a full walkout ""is still on the table.""

UAW President Shawn Fain said Wednesday the Detroit Three had offered 146,000 U.S. auto workers pay raises of as much as 20% over 4-1/2 years, but he blasted the proposal as inadequate even as automakers protested the union had yet to formally respond to their latest, more generous offers. The union is asking for 40% raises and major improvements in benefits.

The Washington Post reported Thursday Biden administration officials are preparing economic measures to protect auto suppliers that could be impacted, including through government loans. The White House declined to comment on the report.

A source told Reuters aid for suppliers has been discussed ""since the minute it became clear there could be a strike"" but those talks are ""premature and fluid.""

Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a letter to employees seen by Reuters, ""bargaining is a two-way street and we continue to implore the UAW to stay at the table, work together to reach an agreement, and avert a strike.""

Ford hourly employees on strike ""would take home nearly 60% less on average with UAW strike pay than they would from working. And without vehicles in production, the profit-sharing checks that UAW workers could expect to receive early next year will also be decimated by a significant strike.""

Fain outlined a strategy to ""create confusion"" with a series of work stoppages targeting individual U.S. plants if no deal is reached.

Stopping work at a key engine or transmission plant, for example, could have a cascading effect by depriving other factories of parts they need to produce vehicles. Another option would be to strike profitable pickup truck or SUV assembly plants.

Fain said it was still possible that at a later date all of the auto workers could strike.

A full strike would hit earnings at each affected automaker by about $400 million to $500 million per week assuming all production was lost, Deutsche Bank has estimated.

Some losses could be recouped by boosting production schedules after a strike, but that possibility fades as a strike extends to weeks or months. A UAW strike would not affect so-called transplant carmakers like Toyota, Honda and Mercedes, whose U.S. plant workers are not represented by the union.

U.S. President Joe Biden has encouraged the parties to stay at the table ""to get a win-win agreement that keeps UAW workers at the heart of our auto future,"" White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein said Wednesday. A prolonged strike could pose political problems for Biden.

Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat, rejected the idea automakers could not pay more, saying the Detroit Three CEOs made a combined $74 million last year.

Ford Motor (F.N) has proposed a 20% hike in pay over the contract term. General Motors previously proposed a 18% hike, and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) 17.5%, Fain said Wednesday. That is less than half the pay hikes the union has sought, but higher than companies' initial offers. It is not clear what is in the new GM offer.

Ford said Thursday it was still waiting for a UAW counteroffer.

Ford warned of a grim scenario. ""The future of our industry is at stake. Let's do everything we can to avert a disastrous outcome.""

The union's demands include restoring defined benefit pensions for all workers, 32-hour work weeks and additional cost-of-living hikes, as well as job security guarantees and an end to the use of temporary workers.

Fain said automakers had rejected the pension, 32-hour work week and other benefit improvements sought. He also criticized proposed changes to profit sharing that would cut payments to workers.

The UAW said it was planning a rally in Detroit on Friday that will include Fain, Senator Bernie Sanders and other members of Congress, coinciding with a first of day of expected walkouts.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/detroit-three-strike-deadline-nears-sides-remain-far-apart-2023-09-14/""&gt;https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/detroit-three-strike-deadline-nears-sides-remain-far-apart-2023-09-14/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

FRANKFURT, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank raised its key interest rate to a record peak on Thursday and signalled this will likely be its final move in a more-than year-long fight against stubbornly high inflation.

The central bank for the 20 countries that share the euro also raised its forecasts for inflation, which it now expects to come down more slowly towards its 2% target over the next two years, while cutting its expectations for economic growth.

That illustrated the dilemma the ECB faced at the meeting, with prices still rising at more than twice its target rate but economic activity struggling under high borrowing costs and a downturn in China.

Against this backdrop, the ECB sent a clear message it was probably done raising rates.

""Based on its current assessment, the Governing Council considers that the key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target,"" the ECB said,

This was expected to happen more slowly than at the time of the ECB's previous projections in June, with inflation now seen at 5.6% in 2023, 3.2% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025.

The upgrade to the 2024 estimate - which had been reported by Reuters earlier - was likely to have played a significant role in discussions as policymakers weighed the risk inflation, currently still above 5%, would get stuck at a high level.

Thursday's 25-basis-point increase pushes the rate the ECB pays on bank deposits to 4.0%, the highest level since the euro currency was launched in 1999.

Just 14 months ago, that rate was languishing at a record low of minus 0.5%, meaning banks had to pay to park their cash securely at the central bank.

In the run-up to the meeting, money markets had expected the deposit rate to peak at 4.0% before being cut in the second half of next year. 0#ECBWATCH.

In contrast, markets have fully priced in unchanged rates at next week's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which started raising earlier and has moved higher than the ECB.

ECB President Christine Lagarde will hold a news conference at 1245 GMT.

NEW FORECASTS
Supporters of a hike this week are likely to have argued it was needed because inflation, including underlying measures that strip out volatile components, remained too high, with a recent surge in energy prices threatening a new acceleration.

But the brisk tightening cycle - twice as steep as normally envisaged by the ECB's own stress tests of the banking sector - has already left its mark on the euro zone economy.

With the manufacturing sector, which typically needs more capital to operate, already suffering as a result of higher borrowing costs, lending to companies and households has fallen off a cliff.

Services has now also started to struggle following a brief post-pandemic boom in tourism.

The euro zone's biggest economy, Germany, was bearing the brunt of an industrial slump and heading for recession, according to several forecasts.

Once its rate increases end, the ECB is likely to begin a debate on mopping up more of the cash it pumped into the banking system through various bond-buying schemes over the last decade, although no decision on that matter was expected this week.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ecb-considers-lifting-rates-record-high-even-economy-slows-2023-09-13/""&gt;https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ecb-considers-lifting-rates-record-high-even-economy-slows-2023-09-13/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Generally speaking, cyclical stocks belong to industries that are sensitive to the business cycle and economic conditions. Basically, people tend to buy things like fancier cars or luxury brands only when they have spare money. Economic recessions mean fewer customers (but not always!), and during economic booms, these stocks do well (also some notable exceptions!).

Of course, everyone wants to buy low and sell high, but with cyclical stocks, it's just as unpredictable as with any other. Economic indicators like employment rates or consumer spending are good metrics to keep an eye on, and when these go down, you'd stop investing in some of these stocks. But which ones do you buy beforehand?

Also, does risk mitigation work just as with any other type of investment? I mean, do you diversify a portfolio by mixing in some non-cyclical or """"defensive"""" stocks like utility companies or healthcare, which are less affected by economic downturns?

Another issue with us thinking we can predict these cycles is how interconnected the world is nowadays (mostly a good thing, of course) and the way information is presented and perceived by consumers.

128,stocks,"A 9% dividend increase was announced by Bank of America. The ex-dividend date for the stock is August 31 and the holder of record date is September 1. When government yields recently soared (i.e., their prices fell), it raised doubts about banks' balance sheets and caused the company's stock to plummet. In principle, this is not an unreasonable fear to have given that BAC has over $106 billion in unrealized securities losses.  
The level of worry, though, might be a little exaggerated. Despite having a large number of unrealized losses, Bank of America has adequate liquidity. Even after bringing them down to fair value, its highly liquid assets still account for around 50% of its deposit base. In other words, the bank could withstand the sudden withdrawal of 50% of its deposits. Furthermore, the bank's liquidity coverage ratio is 119%, exceeding the required level of 100%.  
Bank of America is a strong bank with a fair valuation. It is making significantly more money than it requires to keep paying dividends and increasing them. While the overall picture appears to be quite enticing so far, investors must be aware of a number of risks and difficulties, including a recession and an inverted yield curve.   
In the yield curve, banks borrow on the short end and lend on the long end. Inverse yield curves hence have a tendency to reduce their margins. Bank of America hasn't yet experienced this in this year, although several smaller banks did when their customers withdrew money to invest in treasuries earlier in the year. These ""black swan"" situations compel banks to increase savings/CD interest rates, which lowers their margins.  
Numerous economists predict a recession for the upcoming year. Although there is less agreement now than there was early in the year that a recession is impending, many analysts still hold this view. If that happens, BAC's earnings will likely decrease because bank earnings often decrease during recessions.  
In light of the dangers and difficulties mentioned above, I believe that Bank of America stock is still a good investment for consistent dividend payment in the years to come.

138,stocks,"Hello r/Stocks,

I have a question that I am hoping someone with knowledge about how ETF rebalances work.   
From what I gather, when a new stock is added to something like the S and P 500, there is an effective date given during the press release of the S and P Global.

During the time from the press release and the effective date, is the S and P 500 index having funds reconstitute their compositions to match the % of the newly added fund? Does this reconstitution happen during the duration from the time of announcement to the inclusion date, or does it happen before market opens on inclusion date? But if it happens before market opens, We should expect to see massive volume and price going up due to the new demand coming in. Often times, we do see massive volume, but the stock may trade sideways or even go down. This leads me to think the volume prior to the inclusion date are the index funds buying.

I know there is also a rebalance date. This is where I am a little confused. During rebalance dates, is that also when funds are forced to change their portfolio to match the % composition of the index representation? Or is it just an audit when that day arrives where funds should already be in the correct positional % of the new inclusions.

I hope my question makes sense, and thank you for anyone who has any information / understanding of this for answering.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;a href=""/r/Stocks""&gt;r/Stocks&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

140,stocks,"Markets seem to be brushing off the acceleration in inflation, but I'm concerned investors might be downplaying its potential fallout.

For the first time in six months, we're seeing a rise in core inflation. A 0.3% month-over-month increase might not sound like much compared to 0.7%, but it's still considerably above the Fed's target.

The 0.6% spike in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) caught me off guard as well. The surge in gasoline prices since early July, up by 9.4%, likely contributed to this development.

As oil prices continue their upward trajectory, we might witness gasoline's significant influence on September-October CPI figures. As I’ve previously pointed out, this isn't a scenario the Fed would appreciate.

All of the above suggests that elevated interest rates might linger longer than many of us would like. Cutting rates at this juncture could trigger a sharp inflationary spike, especially when inflation's descent is already proving sluggish.

The repercussions of these sustained high rates are evident in the rising average interest rate on U.S. government debt. After standing at just 1.56% in January 2022, it shot up to 2.92% in August. Now, new Treasury Bills are being issued at rates exceeding 5%.

This implies that, over the next year, the Treasury's interest payments alone could surpass $1 trillion. While the Treasury might weather this storm by borrowing more, those without the Fed's backing could find themselves in a tighter spot.

The longer these rates persist, the greater the chance of significant economic and market disruptions. Ironically, it might take these very disruptions to prompt a rate reduction.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markets seem to be brushing off the acceleration in inflation, but I&amp;#39;m concerned investors might be downplaying its potential fallout.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;**An Important Shift in Fed Officials’ Rate Stance Is Under Way**

&gt;**Central bank is likely to pause rate increases in September, then take a harder look at whether more are needed**

&gt;**For more than a year, Federal Reserve policy makers were unanimous that they would rather raise interest rates too much than too little—that is how serious they considered the threat of persistently high inflation.**

&gt;**That is changing.**


Full story below:

https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/an-important-shift-in-fed-officials-rate-stance-is-under-way-70a91f8a

&gt;Some officials still prefer to err on the side of raising rates too much, reasoning that they can cut them later. Now, though, other officials see risks as more balanced. They worry about raising rates and causing a downturn that turns out to be unnecessary or triggering a new bout of financial turmoil.

&gt;The shift toward a more balanced bias on rates is driven by data showing easing inflation and a less overheated labor market. In addition, the unusually rapid rate increases implemented over the past 1½ years are expected to continue crimping demand in coming months.

&gt;Fed officials raised rates at 11 of their past 12 meetings, most recently in July, to a range between 5.25% and 5.5%, a 22-year high. They appear to be in broad agreement to hold interest rates there at their Sept. 19-20 meeting, giving them more time to see how the economy is responding to increases.

&gt;The bigger debate is what would prompt them to raise rates again in November or December. In June, most officials projected they would need to raise rates by another quarter point this year.

&gt;Projections to be released at the end of the September meeting will likely show that an additional increase is still on the table. But whether they deliver such an increase is an open question. 

&gt;For the past year, officials have placed the burden on evidence of a slowing economy to justify pausing rate increases. As inflation cools, the burden has shifted toward evidence of an accelerating economy to justify higher rates.

&gt;This is apparent from how Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently described the risk that firmer-than-expected economic activity would slow recent progress on inflation. Last month, he twice used the word “could” instead of the more muscular “would” to describe whether the Fed would tighten again. Evidence of stronger growth “could put further progress at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy,” he said in Jackson Hole, Wyo.

&gt;One camp of officials is still anxious about inflation and wants an insurance policy against it by raising rates again this fall. These policy makers worry about ending their tightening campaign only to discover in coming months that it didn’t go far enough. It could be particularly disruptive if financial markets are led to believe inflation and interest rates had flattened out only to learn the opposite.  

&gt;Overtightening is a risk, but “we’ve been underestimating inflation,” Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in an interview last month. “Allowing inflation to be up for longer does carry a cost for the economy.”

&gt;If it turns out such an increase had more of a negative impact than expected, “I’d be more willing to [cut] the rate a little bit faster” next year, she said.

&gt;“I don’t think one more hike would necessarily throw the economy into recession if we did feel that we needed to do one,” Fed governor Christopher Waller said last week. Skipping a September rate rise “does not imply stopping,” Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said.

&gt;Another camp is more supportive of pausing increases. They want to shift the focus from how much higher rates have to go to how long they can stay at current levels. While the economy grew a robust 2.1% annualized in the second quarter and might grow above 3% in this quarter, these officials are skeptical this will be sustained, particularly given slower growth in China and Europe and the lagged impact of past rate rises.

&gt;“The risk of inflation staying higher for longer must now be weighed against the risk that an overly restrictive stance of monetary policy will lead to a greater slowdown than is needed to restore price stability,” said Boston Fed President Susan Collins in a speech last week. “This phase of our policy cycle requires patience.”

&gt;Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note have climbed to around 4.25% from 3.9% since the Fed’s meeting in July, raising an array of borrowing costs, including mortgage rates, which recently hit a 22-year high. That, in effect, does some of the work that a Fed rate increase would be intended to achieve.

&gt;These officials also worry that if one more increase proves unnecessary, reversing it would be more confusing and costly than their more hawkish colleagues appreciate. 

&gt;Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic last month said he would prefer to hold rates at current levels for the next year. As inflation comes down, inflation-adjusted, or “real,” rates will rise. “If we are appropriately cautious, we have the opportunity to minimize the damage that we see on the employment side. That’s not to say there won’t be damage,” he said.

&gt;Measures of underlying inflation that strip out the most volatile price changes have shown a sustained decline this summer. One from the New York Fed dropped below 2.8% in July from a high of 5.5% in June 2022. Other data show the frequency and magnitude of price increases, which accelerated in 2021, have also retreated.

&gt;To be sure, the difference between one more rate increase and none might not be that great in the scheme of things. “Is one going to be right and the other demonstrably wrong? I’m very doubtful,” said Nathan Sheets, a former senior Fed economist who is now chief economist at Citigroup. “What’s left now is fine-tuning.”

&gt;Other economists outside the Fed say spending and growth data can overstate the economy’s strength ahead of a slowdown. “This is how policy accidents always occur: a fixation on backward-looking data,” said Daleep Singh, chief global economist at PGIM Fixed Income.

&gt;“Most of the forward-looking indicators now suggest that while restrictive policy may still be appropriate,” the degree of restraint being delivered by high real rates might soon be “more than this economy can handle,” he said.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known on Wall Street as the &amp;quot;Fed Whisperer,&amp;quot; Nick Timiraos and his news reports at the Wall Street Journal are closely followed due to his deep relationships with officials at the Fed.

In a surprising development, WeWork's stock price soared by almost 87% in a single trading day, the largest one-day gain since its October 2021 public debut. This surge is particularly noteworthy given the coworking company's recent financial struggles, including a dire warning last month of a potential collapse.

The company is still nearly 90% down year-to-date and recently executed a 1-for-40 reverse stock split to avoid being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. WeWork has also posted a net loss of $397 million in Q2 of this year, heightening concerns about its financial stability.

158,stocks,"IMHO, the arguments for investing in Pfizer currently look like this:

Pfizer is a value play. PER of 9-10, yield 5%, not much debt, diverse income streams.

Pfizer is a play on covid continuing to be a pain in the ass for years to come.

Pfizer is a play on their new drug pipeline, with 90 meds in the pipeline before the SeaGen acquisition. In particular, danuglipron (or however it's spelled), their GLP-3 ozempic challenger which is oral and 2x faster working. Consider LLY/NVO jumped 50-60% this year on GLP-3 med success.

Pfizer is a mean-reversion play. It has dumped harder (in % terms) from peak than almost any other profit-making stock in the SP500, and certainly the hardest among the top 100, on relatively little news (most of it good). These things come and go. It will revert back to mean pharma valuation at some point.

Pfizer is a low-beta play. If we return to a bear-market or major correction, it will be a safe haven for equity investors as it was in 2022.

Finally, Pfizer is an anti-bubble stock that will go back to normality. There is a kind of cult of hate towards this stock by people who want covid to be over. It's like the opposite of the cult mentality around meme stocks.

160,stocks,"Howdy everyone.

I'm looking to sell a specific stock of mine that I've held for over a year now, but it has an upcoming dividend, so I was wondering...

If I was to hold the stock during its ""ex dividend date &amp; record date"" and the sell it the following day, would I still recieve the dividend in the following weeks when its paid out?? 
I would presume so, and the limited research ive done says yes, but I'd like to hear from others directly :) 
Thanks

Edit: Thanks for all the in depth replies, has been helpful reading them all. I admittedly wasn't aware of the (now noticable) effect dividends have on the shareprice of many stocks, especially ones with high yields. The stock I was referring to dropped a staggering -6% post dividend, which is a decent amount considering the history graph for the stock. I'm wondering if it's a combination of both the effect of the dividend being given out and simply market movement, as that seems like a lot, especially when comparing it to past dividend % and the correlating share price drop. 

Also just wanted to note - not sure why I'm getting down voted for thanking people...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was to hold the stock during its &amp;quot;ex dividend date &amp;amp; record date&amp;quot; and the sell it the following day, would I still recieve the dividend in the following weeks when its paid out?? 
I would presume so, and the limited research ive done says yes, but I&amp;#39;d like to hear from others directly :) 
Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks for all the in depth replies, has been helpful reading them all. I admittedly wasn&amp;#39;t aware of the (now noticable) effect dividends have on the shareprice of many stocks, especially ones with high yields. The stock I was referring to dropped a staggering -6% post dividend, which is a decent amount considering the history graph for the stock. I&amp;#39;m wondering if it&amp;#39;s a combination of both the effect of the dividend being given out and simply market movement, as that seems like a lot, especially when comparing it to past dividend % and the correlating share price drop. &lt;/p&gt;

168,stocks,"I agree with you that IonQ is a speculative stock, but I believe that it has the potential to change the world and impact almost every industry. Here are some of the reasons why:

IonQ is one of the leading companies in the development of trapped ion quantum computers. Trapped ion quantum computers are considered to be one of the most promising types of quantum computers, and they have the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers.

IonQ has made significant progress in developing its quantum computers. In 2022, the company announced that it had achieved quantum supremacy, which means that its quantum computer was able to solve a problem that would be impossible for a classical computer to solve.

IonQ has a strong team of scientists and engineers. The company's founders are all experts in quantum computing, and they have assembled a team of world-class scientists and engineers to help them develop their technology.

IonQ has a number of partnerships with major companies. These partnerships will help IonQ to bring its technology to market and to develop applications for its quantum computers.

Some of the industries that IonQ could impact include:

Drug discovery: Quantum computers could be used to simulate the behavior of molecules, which could help scientists to design new drugs more quickly and efficiently

Materials science: Quantum computers could be used to design new materials with desired properties.

Finance: Quantum computers could be used to develop new financial algorithms that could improve trading strategies and reduce risk.

Cybersecurity: Quantum computers could be used to break current encryption algorithms, which could have a major impact on cybersecurity.

Artificial intelligence: Quantum computers could be used to develop new AI algorithms that are more powerful and efficient than current AI algorithms.

These are just a few of the ways that IonQ could change the world. The company is still in its early stages but progressing much faster than anticipated via tech metrics and logistics therefore it has the potential to make a major impact on many industries.

Of course, there are also risks associated with investing in IonQ which is why you have a well diversified portfolio with some speculative stocks imo.

CorVel Corporation (NASDAQ: CRVL) today announced the release of its initial Generative AI module. A new addition to CorVel’s CogencyIQ® service offerings, the module will leverage machine learning to interpret medical records for adjusters and prompt immediate actions.

Interpreting medical data and determining the next steps in managing a case is critical and time-consuming for adjusters. CorVel’s generative AI model will now read and summarize this often-complex information, provide the summary to the adjusters, and propose actions to be taken. Simultaneously, the extraction of unstructured data from the reports will be highlighted for the claims staff to quickly and efficiently update claim fields in CareMC and ensure the key stakeholders are notified. This innovative solution significantly reduces the adjuster's time commitment to objective tasks and allows them more time to interface directly with injured workers, be more strategic, and ultimately improve outcomes.

The generative AI module is the latest addition to CorVel’s award-winning CareMC claims platform integrated technology system, which delivers a holistic view of all data on a claim and automates routine processes for speed and efficiency.

“Our approach to Generative AI is marked by intentionality, fostering collaborative efforts with our team and partners. Our unwavering commitment lies in leveraging technology to elevate the efforts of our professional staff and improve the outcomes delivered. We also see generative AI as an efficient approach to mitigate labor-related challenges by offering guidance to upcoming generations of professionals,” said Michael Combs, President and CEO, of CorVel.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;CorVel Corporation (NASDAQ: CRVL) today announced the release of its initial Generative AI module.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical analysis (TA)&lt;/strong&gt; uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;priced in&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security&amp;#39;s price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.&lt;/p&gt;

What was thought of as a place to just get birthday cards and balloons soon became in 2008/2009 when mom lost her job as the place to get kitchen supplies, candy and cleaning supplies. They even sell brooms and mops back in the day for $1. Those mops and brooms are still around. When I went off to the dorm room to start 4 years on campus my mom stopped at none other than Dollar Tree and we got some small glass cups with hanldes that I still use to this day regularly.

In fact I did an online search just now and very similar glasses are sold to this day: [https://www.dollartree.com/glass-sports-mugs-with-handles-16oz/252978](https://www.dollartree.com/glass-sports-mugs-with-handles-16oz/252978) and yeah they raised the price from $1 to $1.25 a piece. This was over a decade ago. I love Dollar Tree and the one in my small city is always packed, as is the one I go to monthly in the bigger city 25 miles away. 

My point with this short real life story about DLTR is that whenever you need to save money and not pay $12 for a broom or $18 for each glass (the going rate at what I just found out doing an average of similar glass cups from higher end stores). We are in tough times right now in this market and economy. I am working more hours, as is everyone else I know, and even working 70-80 hours on average a week I barely have enough to break even because cost of living is high. Used to have $800 leftover each month now am lucky to have $200 leftover, working full time, with overtime because as they have said the rent is too damn high. 

Enough about my personal story, I will say DLTR is like with me going to come in handy for many people as our market (most likely) slips. They should be trading above $150 and them being around $115 is a bargain just like their store's goods.

178,stocks,"Strictly speaking, *Thinking Fast and Slow* is not an investing book, but I've seen it referenced and quoted so many times in other investing books that I simply had to go read it for myself. I'm very glad to say that I had not wasted my time and this is an excellent book on all aspects of decision making. Daniel Kahneman is the foremost expert in the field of decision-making and judgement, even receiving a nobel prize in 2002 for his contributions to the field of behavioural economics. Kahneman covers a lot of ground in this book, but for the purposes of this post, I'll be focusing mainly on what he has to say about our money decisions.  


* ***Anchoring***

The anchoring effect is the tendency for a given number to affect people's estimation of an unknown value, regardless of whether the given number resulted from a dice throw or in-depth calculation.   
Kahneman and his research partner Amos Tversky rigged a wheel of fortune to only land on 10 or 65.

Then they invited university students in for an experiment. First, they spin the wheel, then had the student write down the number it landed on. Afterwards, Kahneman and Tversky asked the students ""Is the percentage of African nations among UN members larger or smaller than the number you just wrote? What is your best guess of the percentage of African nations in the UN?"" Students know that the number was produced by random, the written number should not have any influence on the students' estimation of African nations in the UN. Yet on average, those students who got 10 estimated 25% while those who got 65 estimated 45%. 

In the instance of estimating the intrinsic value of a stock, we are similarly persuaded. **The given number (stock price) will inevitably influence our estimation of the stock's true worth unless we're exceedingly wary. It's for this reason that overpriced stocks look attractive while underpriced stocks look risky.** Despite the fact that we should not let the actual price of a stock influence our calculation of its intrinsic value, most of us can't help but do so due to the anchoring effect. For example, imagine you have a normal plastic bag. If asked, we might say it's worth a nickel at most. However, if the store priced the plastic bag at $1000 and hundreds of people purchased it for that price, we might be persuaded that the plastic bag is worth more when it's not.  


* ***Overconfidence***

System 1 is unconscious and therefore, it isn't able to second-guess and self-evaluate its judgements. Paired with a lazy System 2, it's only too easy for people to form beliefs that lack evidence. **Confidence, contrary to what our intuition says, is not an indication of correctness. In fact, the more confident we are, the more vigilant we should be.** In the case of investing, it's important not to be led astray by overconfidence, both your own and that of investing professionals.

Given the danger and prevalence of overconfidence, Kahneman offers us a thought experiment called the postmortem to help diminish the tendency. Postmortem is where you imagine that the project you're about to embark upon or the business you're about to invest in had failed 15 years down the line. You then take 5-10 minutes to brainstorm how this might have happened. In performing this exercise, you inoculate yourself against overconfidence and create opportunity to pre-empt future mistakes.  


* ***Loss Aversion***

At the core of many of our poor money choices lie loss aversion. The idea is that most people feel the loss of something far more acutely than they feel the gain. Through his research, Kaneman found that the ratio of loss aversion measures out to 1:2 or 1:1.5 on average. This means you must earn $200-$150 to offset the psychological pain of losing $100.

Although it's reasonable to protect wealth more fiercely than pursue gains, many people are loss averse to the point of irrationality. When faced with an offer of ""pay $400 for 95% chance to win $1,000"" OR ""pay $700 to win $1,000 for sure"" most of us would go with the second option. Objectively speaking, 95% chance to win $600 is an excellent deal, yet we are willing to pay a hefty premium to eliminate the negligible chance of losing money.

To resolve this in-equivalency Kahneman recommends taking a broadview perspective when investing. **We are not making a single investment, we are making a number of investments that will average out. Waiting until we come upon an opportunity that offers 100% guarantee to make money means we'll never invest at all.** It may also mean we end up relying solely on bank deposits with returns that fail to keep up with inflation, an inevitable result of loss. Yes, it's likely that some investments will come out at a loss, but as long as you make more good investments than bad, your net result will follow the trend of probability. Meanwhile, if you shy away from good deals, these missed opportunities will gradually accumulate into a big loss.   


* ***Attitude to Risk***

In Kahneman and Tversky's Nobel Prize-winning theory called Prospect Theory, they posited that just as there are diminishing returns for gains, there is a similarly diminishing impact for losses.

Kahneman offers two illustrative problems to explain prospect theory:  
***Problem 1****: Which do you choose?*  
*Get $900 for sure OR 90% chance to get $1,000*  
***Problem 2****: Which do you choose?*  
*Lose $900 for sure OR 90% chance to lose $1,000*

As mentioned in the previous point on Loss Aversion, most people would much prefer to get $900 for sure for Problem 1. What's interesting is that this situation is entirely inverted in Problem 2. All of a sudden, people would prefer a 90% chance to lose $1,000 over a guaranteed loss of $900.

The reason is because going from $900 to $1,000 is an insignificant increase in psychological value and the 10% risk of getting nothing at all is a huge loss. We are unwilling to put $900 on the line for a chance to gain an additional $100, even when the odds of success is 90%. When it comes to gains, we are risk averse.

Meanwhile, going from a sure loss of $900 to a potential loss of $1,000 is precisely the opposite. If we are guaranteed to lose $900, the loss of an additional $100 feels negligible. In exchange for the possibility of losing an additional $100, we gain a 10% chance to lose nothing at all, which has much greater psychological value. When it comes to losses, we are risk seeking.

Why is this important?

**Consider we purchased a stock for $80 a share and it has gone down to $30. We know the company is performing poorly and the economy is entering a recession. The odds that the stock will drop to $20 and stay at that price is 90%. The smart decision is to sell the stock at $30 and reinvest in another stronger company, but because we are risk seeking when faced with loss, we hold on to the stock for that slim 10% chance that it will bounce back to $80 a share.** This is the reason why we hold on to losing stocks and refuse to realize a loss. Selling now and losing $50 for sure feels much worse than a 90% chance to lose an additional $10 and a 10% chance to make it all back.

&amp;#x200B;

**The good:** This book is full of excellent psychological concepts presented alongside compelling examples, both in the form of theoretical thought experiments and actual experiments conducted by experts. Kahneman not only taught me lots of new psychology concepts but also explained familiar concepts (priming, availability heuristic, loss aversion) in a new way so I had a truer, deeper understanding. This book will be of great use to anyone who makes decisions on a regular basis.

**The bad:** As you can imagine, this book goes very fast, especially in the later chapters. It sometimes felt like concepts that deserved its own chapter (or even its own book) are allotted only pages and paragraphs, which is a shame. This book also lacks a clear progression of ideas, it very much feels like a bunch of related but disparate concepts packaged together into a book.

**Personal thoughts:** I really enjoyed this book and I highly recommend it. It's a fairly long read (my edition was 499 pages) and at times rather dense, but it's well worth the time and effort. While writing this review I really struggled to choose which concepts to include and which to leave out because all of the ideas from Thinking Fast and Slow feels so fundamental to the way we make decisions.

If you've read this book too, I would really appreciate it if you drop a mention of something from the book I wasn't able to cover because goodness knows there are a lot.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anchoring effect is the tendency for a given number to affect people&amp;#39;s estimation of an unknown value, regardless of whether the given number resulted from a dice throw or in-depth calculation.&lt;br/&gt;
Kahneman and his research partner Amos Tversky rigged a wheel of fortune to only land on 10 or 65.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, imagine you have a normal plastic bag. If asked, we might say it&amp;#39;s worth a nickel at most. However, if the store priced the plastic bag at $1000 and hundreds of people purchased it for that price, we might be persuaded that the plastic bag is worth more when it&amp;#39;s not.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overconfidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System 1 is unconscious and therefore, it isn&amp;#39;t able to second-guess and self-evaluate its judgements. Paired with a lazy System 2, it&amp;#39;s only too easy for people to form beliefs that lack evidence. &lt;strong&gt;Confidence, contrary to what our intuition says, is not an indication of correctness. In fact, the more confident we are, the more vigilant we should be.&lt;/strong&gt; In the case of investing, it&amp;#39;s important not to be led astray by overconfidence, both your own and that of investing professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the danger and prevalence of overconfidence, Kahneman offers us a thought experiment called the postmortem to help diminish the tendency. Postmortem is where you imagine that the project you&amp;#39;re about to embark upon or the business you&amp;#39;re about to invest in had failed 15 years down the line. You then take 5-10 minutes to brainstorm how this might have happened. In performing this exercise, you inoculate yourself against overconfidence and create opportunity to pre-empt future mistakes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loss Aversion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of many of our poor money choices lie loss aversion. The idea is that most people feel the loss of something far more acutely than they feel the gain. Through his research, Kaneman found that the ratio of loss aversion measures out to 1:2 or 1:1.5 on average. This means you must earn $200-$150 to offset the psychological pain of losing $100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it&amp;#39;s reasonable to protect wealth more fiercely than pursue gains, many people are loss averse to the point of irrationality. When faced with an offer of &amp;quot;pay $400 for 95% chance to win $1,000&amp;quot; OR &amp;quot;pay $700 to win $1,000 for sure&amp;quot; most of us would go with the second option. Objectively speaking, 95% chance to win $600 is an excellent deal, yet we are willing to pay a hefty premium to eliminate the negligible chance of losing money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To resolve this in-equivalency Kahneman recommends taking a broadview perspective when investing. &lt;strong&gt;We are not making a single investment, we are making a number of investments that will average out. Waiting until we come upon an opportunity that offers 100% guarantee to make money means we&amp;#39;ll never invest at all.&lt;/strong&gt; It may also mean we end up relying solely on bank deposits with returns that fail to keep up with inflation, an inevitable result of loss. Yes, it&amp;#39;s likely that some investments will come out at a loss, but as long as you make more good investments than bad, your net result will follow the trend of probability. Meanwhile, if you shy away from good deals, these missed opportunities will gradually accumulate into a big loss.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attitude to Risk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kahneman and Tversky&amp;#39;s Nobel Prize-winning theory called Prospect Theory, they posited that just as there are diminishing returns for gains, there is a similarly diminishing impact for losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kahneman offers two illustrative problems to explain prospect theory:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Which do you choose?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Get $900 for sure OR 90% chance to get $1,000&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Which do you choose?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Lose $900 for sure OR 90% chance to lose $1,000&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the previous point on Loss Aversion, most people would much prefer to get $900 for sure for Problem 1. What&amp;#39;s interesting is that this situation is entirely inverted in Problem 2. All of a sudden, people would prefer a 90% chance to lose $1,000 over a guaranteed loss of $900.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is because going from $900 to $1,000 is an insignificant increase in psychological value and the 10% risk of getting nothing at all is a huge loss. We are unwilling to put $900 on the line for a chance to gain an additional $100, even when the odds of success is 90%. When it comes to gains, we are risk averse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, going from a sure loss of $900 to a potential loss of $1,000 is precisely the opposite. If we are guaranteed to lose $900, the loss of an additional $100 feels negligible. In exchange for the possibility of losing an additional $100, we gain a 10% chance to lose nothing at all, which has much greater psychological value. When it comes to losses, we are risk seeking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider we purchased a stock for $80 a share and it has gone down to $30. We know the company is performing poorly and the economy is entering a recession. The odds that the stock will drop to $20 and stay at that price is 90%. The smart decision is to sell the stock at $30 and reinvest in another stronger company, but because we are risk seeking when faced with loss, we hold on to the stock for that slim 10% chance that it will bounce back to $80 a share.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the reason why we hold on to losing stocks and refuse to realize a loss. Selling now and losing $50 for sure feels much worse than a 90% chance to lose an additional $10 and a 10% chance to make it all back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The good:&lt;/strong&gt; This book is full of excellent psychological concepts presented alongside compelling examples, both in the form of theoretical thought experiments and actual experiments conducted by experts. Kahneman not only taught me lots of new psychology concepts but also explained familiar concepts (priming, availability heuristic, loss aversion) in a new way so I had a truer, deeper understanding. This book will be of great use to anyone who makes decisions on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bad:&lt;/strong&gt; As you can imagine, this book goes very fast, especially in the later chapters. It sometimes felt like concepts that deserved its own chapter (or even its own book) are allotted only pages and paragraphs, which is a shame. This book also lacks a clear progression of ideas, it very much feels like a bunch of related but disparate concepts packaged together into a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt; I really enjoyed this book and I highly recommend it. It&amp;#39;s a fairly long read (my edition was 499 pages) and at times rather dense, but it&amp;#39;s well worth the time and effort. While writing this review I really struggled to choose which concepts to include and which to leave out because all of the ideas from Thinking Fast and Slow feels so fundamental to the way we make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve read this book too, I would really appreciate it if you drop a mention of something from the book I wasn&amp;#39;t able to cover because goodness knows there are a lot.  &lt;/p&gt;

Morgan Stanley's upgrade of TSLA was a target of $400, up from $250.

Excerpt from the article:

&gt; Tesla has been mentioning how Dojo gives it an edge in AI and self-driving technology since at least 2021. In July this year, CEO Elon Musk told investors that the carmaker plans to invest more than $1 billion on the project by the end of 2024.

&gt; Seth Goldstein of Morningstar Research Services LLC says that, “while it’s good for Elon to push the team to go as quickly as possible, in reality Tesla usually sees a delay from Elon’s original timelines.”

&gt; “It doesn’t mean they aren’t making progress,” Goldstein said in a phone interview Monday. “Once Dojo is up and running and takes over the software training, it will allow Tesla to update software more quickly and increase subscriptions at software margins, which can be a big value driver.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headline comes from Bloomberg &lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-surge-thanks-dojo-supercomputer-032644640.html""&gt;(yahoo link)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seth Goldstein of Morningstar Research Services LLC says that, “while it’s good for Elon to push the team to go as quickly as possible, in reality Tesla usually sees a delay from Elon’s original timelines.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t mean they aren’t making progress,” Goldstein said in a phone interview Monday. “Once Dojo is up and running and takes over the software training, it will allow Tesla to update software more quickly and increase subscriptions at software margins, which can be a big value driver.”&lt;/p&gt;

Very excited about potential of Globalstar ($GSAT) with new CEO, Paul Jacobs, former CEO of Qualcomm

I believe Globalstar Inc. (GSAT) is poised for significant growth in the next 6 months, and there are several compelling factors to support my bullish outlook:

Stellar Leadership: Globalstar has made a brilliant strategic move by appointing Paul E. Jacobs, the former CEO of Qualcomm, as its new CEO. Jacobs brings a wealth of experience and a strong network in the technology industry. His leadership can be a game-changer, as reported by Fierce Wireless, Seeking Alpha, and Reuters. His track record suggests he can navigate the company toward innovation and expansion.

SpaceX Collaboration: Globalstar has chosen to collaborate with SpaceX, one of the most renowned companies in the space industry, to upgrade its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation. This partnership, as highlighted in SpaceNews, holds immense promise. It demonstrates Globalstar's commitment to enhancing its infrastructure, which can lead to improved satellite communication services. With the space sector booming, this collaboration puts Globalstar in a prime position to capitalize on the increasing demand for satellite-based services.

I earned my MSFT shares during my career there and am pretty bullish on their future, hence the big slice of the pie they occupy. I added the TSLA in 2016 and sold a few when it had a big gain but again I'm bullish on them. Most of the stocks have been held for at least 3 years.  
  
So, what are your thoughts?  
  
Should I rebalance these existing stocks?  
Should I consider adding AAPL to diversify a bit within the tech sector?  
Or should I just move it all into QQQ for ease of management?

  
Just seeking opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

If I don't simplify now I will need to in the coming years. I have a couple of years of cash equivalents available and will rebalance annually.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not keen to just put it all in in an S&amp;P tracker or whatever as I believe tech will out perform for the foreseeable future. Also much of the rest of my retirement fund is well diversified in managed funds I can't touch yet due to tax/age.

Sooner or later, regardless of how exceptional they are, companies find themselves in the midst of multi-year downturns. It happened to Coca Cola, PepsiCo, Microsoft, and Apple, just to name a few.  
The only time British American Tobacco has been cheaper than today was at the end of the largest civil litigation settlement in U.S. history, which resulted in the tobacco companies paying the states and territories billions of dollars in yearly instalments. *It went then on to become a* ***15-bagger*** *over the subsequent 17 years,* ***not accounting for dividends***.  
Now, the company does currently face noteworthy challenges (i.e. negative secular trends in smoking and a substantial debt burden), but the current valuation seems to be factoring in a higher level of risk than may actually exist.
  
**DECLINING SMOKING RATES**  
Even though smoking rates continue to decline, the company is effectively offsetting the trend through a successful diversification of its product portfolio. The oligopolistic nature of tobacco markets also gives them significant pricing power, especially since demand for their products is relatively inelastic, resulting in inordinate profitability and robust cash flows.
  
**DEBT BURDEN**  
The company has debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years, and due to higher interest rates, net finance costs are expected to increase as debts are refinanced.  
However, it currently holds about £4 billion in cash, expects to generate at least an additional £5+ billion in post-dividend free cash flow, and had access to an undrawn £5.5 billion revolving credit facility as of 30 June 2023. This sums up to more than £14 billion in liquidity available to meet its debt obligations within the specified time frame. Contrary to claims of insolvency, the company's financials demonstrate otherwise.

  
**HEADS I WIN, TAILS I...STILL WIN**  
It does not happen very often that companies with cash flows so consistent and predictable offer a ***FCF yield of 17%***. Not to mention the fact that they're still growing earnings and that a multiple expansion is not unlikely over the next decade (In 2000, the company traded at just 7x earnings before eventually returning to its historical norm of 13 to 14x).  
This is an ***immensely-wide moat and non-cyclical stock*** ***currently paying a 9% dividend yield*** with a conservative 60% earnings payout ratio and a well-established track record of dividend payments spanning many decades. Investors are getting average stock market returns from the dividend alone.

""*

Charter cable is now showing notificaitons to its millions of customers that they **have partnered with $FUBO, and customers get a free trial.** not sure if i can post screenshots here, but stock twits users have been posting all sorts of screenshots for sometime now.

While, Disney and Charter may resolve their dispute and get back to a working deal, this has proven to be a free, targeted (to all ESPN fans) promotion of $FUBO.

And quite a well known tactic in subscription world - free trial to paid subscribers to long term users.

And if the dispute doesn't get resolved, even better for $FUBO.

This company has shown consistent revenue growth from \~$5M in Sep 2019 to \~$313M in Jun 2023 -

[https://ycharts.com/companies/FUBO/revenues](https://ycharts.com/companies/FUBO/revenues)

User base has grown significantly. While costs remain a concern, a sudden influx of users seem likely this quarter and might help it in the future.

Consumers do have other choices as mentioned in the fortune article -

1. switching to other cable that has Disney packs
2. youtube tv
3. hulu + live

So not a huge % of customers will go to $FUBO. But with free trial they will at least get introduced to the service, increasing the probability that they will turn into subscribers.

Also, there is another angle of cable vs streaming -

""

*Charter wants to use Disney to transform its cable business by creating a new type of cable bundle that also includes streaming. If Charter doesn’t prevail it may simply walk away from its cable business, because it says it can’t make the numbers work otherwise.*

*“We have already reached the point of economic indifference with the current model,” the company said in an investor presentation, using jargon that masks the threat of entirely pulling out of one of its core businesses.*

""

If Charter wants to offer cable + streaming, and if they don't want to be hostage to Disney's asks in the future, would they be better off just by buying out $FUBO as it's at lower valuation anyway ? As Charter has already shown trust in $FUBO by partnering with them over other streaming services (apart from $DIS), wouldn't that be logical (while economical needs to be tested) if they anyway want this new business model ?

Was surprised to read in next para that Charter's revenue was $17B in 2022. While cable business is in decline, Charter seem to be quite big enough to acquire $FUBO right away.

What do you think, how will this play out ? Thanks for sharing your thoughts!

I’ve been looking at lots of stocks in terms of reverse dfc and it seems to me that MercadoLibre is undervalued by about 50%.  They are still growing sales by more than 30% y/y and are improving their operating margin by increasing take rates and reducing costs.  They turn out outstanding results quarter after quarter and when faced with competitive threats from players such as Amazon and Shopee, they just keep coming out on top.

I have a somewhat focused portfolio of 9 stocks, but with the numbers I’m seeing, I just really want to put everything into MercadoLibre (not that I have a big portfolio - just around 30k)

Every other growth stock I evaluate seems either overvalued or reasonably valued, taking into account ten years of reasonable growth assumptions.  Take Nvidia for example.  I own Nvidia and based on my reverse DCF, if they can grow FCF by 30% for ten years, the stock is currently fairly valued.  I think they might be able to pull that off, so Nvidia might be worth owning.

But according to the same model, MercadoLibre only needs to grow FCF 11% annually over the next 10 years to justify their current valution.  This just seems like an absurdly low bar for them.

If my model is off, it would be off in the same direction for all the companies im evaluating.  Part of me thinks I should just invest in this one company that has both amazing fundamentals and low valuation.  Another part of me is just saying “hell no!  Always stay diversified!”

It’s like Cramer vs Munger in my head.  One voice says “5 stocks minimum”. The other says, “why buy anything but your best idea?”  Peter Lynch is also in my head.  I live in Mexico and use Mercado Libre’s services, so it’s a company I can get behind on a personal level.  I think Lynch would approve.

Nearly a third of all outstanding US government debt is set to mature in the next 12 months, according to an analysis from asset management firm Apollo. A chart from Chief Economist Torsten Sløk shows that the share of US public debt set to mature in a year or less has steadily risen toward pandemic-era levels and is now at 31%. In terms of dollar amount, that's $7.6 trillion, a high not seen since early 2021. In addition, public debt maturing in the near term accounts for more than a quarter of US GDP. However, this is below its 2020 peak, when it made up a significantly larger share. Still, Sløk said the $7.6 trillion coming due is one source of upward pressure on US rates.

The estimate comes as federal deficits have exploded in recent years, sharply elevating the trajectory of US debt. The Treasury Department has already auctioned $1 trillion in bonds just within this quarter. Meanwhile, borrowing costs have soared in the last year and a half as the Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive tightening campaign, raising the government's debt-servicing costs. As of Friday afternoon, the 10-year Treasury yield stood at 4.25%, and three-month yield was 5.47%. Rates have also been under pressure from the Fed's quantitative tightening program, which removed a top buyer from the bond market.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-6-trillion-us-government-040643412.html""&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-6-trillion-us-government-040643412.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What do you do? You need extra revenue, and you need it fast! So, you come up with a ""brilliant"" idea. 💡

You find a partner, you invest in them, and in return, they magically **""buy""** your product. Voilà! You've got revenue, albeit a bit inflated.

Enter Michael Saylor, the current Bitcoin hero, was the unsung hero of the early 2000s internet boom. Many of you may not know but, he ran a tech company that soared to the heavens with a massively successful IPO, making him a billionaire at just 34.

But here's the **twist**:

Behind the scenes, the quarterly and annual reports were like a magician's trick, filled with carefully crafted financial shenanigans like the ""boomerang"" transactions, **made just before the period** ended.

As long as there was no Sherlock Holmes-level auditing, Michael Saylor was living the American dream to the max!

But then came Forbes (yes, they were lit back then). They dropped the bomb, and PwC audited everything, exposing the grand scheme.

Michael called it ""material accounting irregularities,"" but the market wasn't feeling generous. In a single day, the share price nosedived by a jaw-dropping 60%, and it finally hit rock bottom at $1.75. Ouch!

Now, we're left wondering whether Michael Saylor is still pulling these shenanigans. Only time will spill the beans.

**Moral** of the story, my fellow investors: Don't underestimate those SEC filing reports like 10K and 8K's, even if they're a tad bit boring, especially the footnotes and understand their revenue recognition practices. Your hard-earned money deserves nothing less! 💼💰

I&amp;#39;ve been reading articles that say September and October and historically bad months for stocks.  Is this because of the end of quarter results or something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the reason for this crash in September?
It seems a lot of past recessions started in Sept and Oct.&lt;/p&gt;

232,stocks,"My current holding are in PFE, VRNT, QQQ and GM. Currently I do not use trailing stop loss orders but I was talking to a veteran trader yesterday at a conference. The trader said the average person could make a lot more money if they took all of their money and set 1% or 2% trailing stop losses on their orders. In other words say your average investor/trader has $20k in their brokerage. They wait for a few red days in a row and then put all $20k into one stock they believe is oversold and will run up in months to come. They buy the stock and then immediately put in a trailing top loss order of 2% so worst case scenario is they loose 2%. Stock runs up 5% in a week then drops 8% the week after? You are still making a profit because it sells after a 2% drop after the 5% recent peak so you walk with a 3% profit.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Shares of AMC Entertainment fell sharply on Wednesday after the theater chain said in a filing that it plans to sell up to 40 million new shares to raise cash.

The stock dropped 36.8%, bringing it to $8.62 per share. On a split-adjusted basis, that is AMC’s lowest close on record, according to FactSet.

AMC was widely expected to sell additional shares after the successful conversion of the preferred APE shares into AMC common stock in August. It followed the settlement of a lawsuit objecting to the move.

The theater chain sold millions of shares of common stock in recent years after becoming one of the so-called meme stocks popular with retail traders. The sales helped AMC stabilize itself after the Covid pandemic effectively halted the theatrical movie business.

However, AMC used up its allotment of stock and needed shareholder approval to issue more. The company issued the preferred APE shares as part of a strategy to change its corporate voting structure and get shareholder approval to sell additional common stock.

AMC said in the filing Wednesday that it will sell the new shares through “at-the-market” offerings, without a specific time frame. Citigroup, Barclays, B. Riley Securities and Goldman Sachs are listed as sales agents in the filing.

The U.S. movie business remains below pre-pandemic levels, and the ongoing strikes in Hollywood have clouded the release slate for the rest of 2023 and 2024. AMC and pop star Taylor Swift announced last week that the theater chain is serving as the distributor for a concert movie of The Eras Tour to be released in October.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link: &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/06/amc-shares-fall-as-it-announces-plan-to-sell-additional-stock.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/06/amc-shares-fall-as-it-announces-plan-to-sell-additional-stock.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Price to Sales - less than 1

Metrics relative to the industry in terms of percentile the company is in for said metric (P/B, P/E, P/S, EV, FCF, profit margin, and ROI)

Several agencies have begun instructing staff not to bring their iPhones to work, people familiar with the matter said, affirming a previous report from the Wall Street Journal. In addition, **Beijing intends to extend that restriction far more broadly to a plethora of state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled organizations**, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter.

If Beijing goes ahead, **the unprecedented blockade will be the culmination of a yearslong effort to root out foreign technology use** in sensitive environments, coinciding with Beijing’s effort to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry. It **threatens to erode Apple’s position in a market that yields about a fifth of its revenue**, and from where it makes the majority of the world’s iPhones through sprawling factories that employ millions of Chinese.

Chinese state firms like oil giant PetroChina Co. employ millions and control vast swathes of a centrally planned economy. Given Apple’s relationship with Beijing and its importance to the economy, it “has historically been viewed as relatively safe in China from government restrictions,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel said in a report Wednesday. “Is the government changing its stance?”

A representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. The State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and the State Council Information Office didn’t respond to faxed requests for comment.

Given Apple’s relationship with Beijing and its importance to the economy, it “has historically been viewed as relatively safe in China from government restrictions,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel said in a report Wednesday. “Is the government changing its stance?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. The State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and the State Council Information Office didn’t respond to faxed requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

Apple is doubling down on its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities with significant investments in multiple specialized AI teams. Led by John Giannandrea, the company's Head of AI, these units aim to develop advanced models to compete with leading AI technologies by OpenAI and Google. The ""Foundational Models"" team, with about 16 members, is working to enhance Siri and explore AI language models. Other teams focus on visual intelligence and multimodal AI, covering image, video, and text generation. One application under development is an AppleCare chatbot.

251,stocks,"Block, Inc. (SQ) received a downgrade from UBS, shifting its rating from ""Buy"" to ""Neutral"" and significantly reducing the price target from $102 to $65.   
  
The downgrade was driven by concerns about the limited upside potential for Block, particularly in terms of its digital payment platform. UBS analysts cited a focus on gross profit growth as a key area of concern for investors. They also connected the slowing gross profit growth to a softening in consumer discretionary spending, suggesting that this trend could negatively impact the company's performance.  
  
Despite the downgrade, it's noteworthy that the stock initially saw more significant declines in premarket trading but had stabilized to a 0.25% decrease at the time of the discussion.  
  
The stock's current valuation was mentioned, with shares trading near a five-year low in terms of certain multiples. The downgrade was seen as reflecting the anticipation of a slowdown in gross profit growth, which had already been priced into the stock.  
  
SQ does not look good. Not good at all.. too many times it has sunk below 60 which means 60 will end up becoming resistance and this will drop below, much much below.  
  
I’ve owned this stock for quite a long time, but two things they’ve done since that really bother me:   
1. Changed their name to Block and 2. Responsible for making the world have to tip on EVERYTHING. Seeing a monitor spin around at me with “asking you a question” when buying a brownie or apple juice makes me sour.  
  
I have also owned some small capital fintech stocks and trust me as compared to SQ they have performed better. Stocks like HIVE SOFI OLB have given me a decent return as compared to SQ  
  
OLB is worth just $10.63 million in the stock market, but it made nearly $31 million in sales last year.  
  
Whereas SoFi Technologies had revenue of $1.85B in the twelve months ending June 30, 2023, with 48.01% growth year-over-year.  
  
SQ really needs to hurry up and do a better job of connecting the ecosystems together. They've been talking it up now for well over a year and still, there has not been huge progress in terms of surfacing local square merchants in the cash app and incentivizing more purchases with those merchants either through cash card or through after-pay. Dorsey has spoken recently that he is a bit disappointed with the progress they've made to date there and they really do need to pull the finger out and get moving.  
  
But still, I think SQ will be close to going up. It could go lower and if it does, then it is, perhaps a punchline to set the stage for a stronger rebound I hope, so I think it is an accumulation opportunity.

**Non-GAAP net income per share between $0.30 and $0.31, assuming 273 million basic weighted-average shares outstanding.**  
  
Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
  
This press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures associated with our condensed consolidated statements of operations:  
  
Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin  
  
Non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP operating margin  
  
Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share  
  
We define these non-GAAP financial measures as the respective U.S. GAAP measures, excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation expense-related charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We believe that it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expense-related charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies over multiple periods. In periods of net loss, we calculate non-GAAP net income (loss) per share by using non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by basic weighted average shares for the period regardless of whether we are in a non-GAAP net income or (loss) position and assuming that all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive.  
  
In addition, the press release and the accompanying tables contain free cash flow which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software. We believe that free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity as it measures our ability to generate cash, or our need to access additional sources of cash, to fund operations and investments. We expect our free cash flow to fluctuate in future periods with changes in our operating expenses and as we continue to invest in our growth. We typically experience higher billings in the fourth quarter compared to other quarters and experience higher collections of accounts receivable in the first half of the year, which results in a decrease in accounts receivable in the first half of the year.  
  
However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. As a result, our non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP.  
  
Sprinklr has not reconciled its financial outlook expectations as to non-GAAP operating income, or as to non-GAAP net income per share, to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures as a result of the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures; in particular, the measures and effects of stock-based compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our stock price. We expect the variability of the above charges to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP financial results. Accordingly, reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort, although it is important to note that these factors could be material to Sprinklr’s results computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure why there is no rockets AH, it even went down 1% AH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total revenue between $719 million and $721 million.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-GAAP operating income between $65 million and $67 million.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-GAAP net income per share between $0.30 and $0.31, assuming 273 million basic weighted-average shares outstanding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures associated with our condensed consolidated statements of operations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP operating margin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define these non-GAAP financial measures as the respective U.S. GAAP measures, excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation expense-related charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We believe that it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expense-related charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies over multiple periods. In periods of net loss, we calculate non-GAAP net income (loss) per share by using non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by basic weighted average shares for the period regardless of whether we are in a non-GAAP net income or (loss) position and assuming that all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the press release and the accompanying tables contain free cash flow which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software. We believe that free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity as it measures our ability to generate cash, or our need to access additional sources of cash, to fund operations and investments. We expect our free cash flow to fluctuate in future periods with changes in our operating expenses and as we continue to invest in our growth. We typically experience higher billings in the fourth quarter compared to other quarters and experience higher collections of accounts receivable in the first half of the year, which results in a decrease in accounts receivable in the first half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. As a result, our non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprinklr has not reconciled its financial outlook expectations as to non-GAAP operating income, or as to non-GAAP net income per share, to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures as a result of the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures; in particular, the measures and effects of stock-based compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our stock price. We expect the variability of the above charges to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP financial results. Accordingly, reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort, although it is important to note that these factors could be material to Sprinklr’s results computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.&lt;/p&gt;

Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is hoping to move towards a one-hour settlement cycle as early as March next year and instantaneous settlement by October 2024, SEBI chief Madhabi Puri Buch said on Tuesday at the sidelines of the Global Fintech Fest 2023.  
  
India completed the transition to the T+1 settlement cycle in January this year. For instance, a client buying shares on Tuesday under T+1 system gets his shares credited to his demat account on Wednesday. Under the one-hour settlement, this transaction would take place within an hour.  
  
“The technology for implementing the one-hour settlement cycle already exists. The industry is working on a new technology for instantaneous settlement,” said Buch.  
  
To boot, the ASBA-like settlement mechanism for secondary trades will go for pilot testing in December and will be up and running in January. This is similar to the Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA)-like facility that is operational in the primary market which ensures that investor money moves only when allotment happens.  
  
Cyber security  
SEBI is also beefing up systems to deal with broker and exchange or clearing corporation (CC) failures. The exchanges and CCs have implemented a software-as-a-service model in order to ensure that trading continues in the event one exchange or CC goes down.  
  
Data of one exchange will now physically reside on the premises of the second exchange and will be instantaneously updated in real time.   
“So if one clearing corporation or exchange goes down, that data is taken and actually uploaded into the software system of the second exchange,” the SEBI chief said  
  
The regulator is also working on a mechanism that will allow clients of a broker to have direct access to the exchange in order to manage and close out his positions, in case the broker goes down.  
  
Buch referred to these two mechanisms as non-classical approach to cyber security.  
  
Backing AI usage  
The regulator will turn to artificial intelligence and algorithmic alerts to identify mis-selling in the financial ecosystem. “We have built algos but haven’t applied AI. We are hoping that some of our young colleagues are able to develop it in-house,” said Buch.  
  
The existing financial players are undergoing massive transformation and morphing more and more into fintech companies, Buch said.  
  
  
“To us, a stock exchange is a fintech company. Mutual fund platform MF Central is nothing but a fintech in terms of its substance. This morphing of incumbents has a huge advantage. They have the cash flows, manpower, and the stability of the traditional businesses. Yet, when they put their minds to it and apply the principles of modern technology, they transform into this new rocket ships,” she said.

I believe that analyzing long-term technicals will provide an inaccurate picture to the reality of where this stock is heading, and in my opinion, the direction is not favorable for most investors or for Savers, but it could be for Ares, though I have reasons for believing that it won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

I provide my thoughts and opinions, at the most, as food for thought, but never, ever, as financial advice. Please, do your due diligence before making investment decisions.

Comcast and Disney have modified their Hulu agreement to enable the expected buyout of Comcast’s one-third stake in the streamer to begin on September 30 instead of next January. The news was shared at a Goldman Sachs conference appearance by Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, who said the initial minimum valuation of $27.5 billion for Hulu agreed to in 2019 was “just a hypothetical.” He suggested the final price tag could be much higher. Roberts said both companies “wanted to get this behind us,” so they reached an agreement last week to accelerate the timeline.

On September 30, Disney can “put” and Comcast can “call,” which starts the process of the one-third stake moving to Disney. Each company will have its own appraiser and then there will be third-party appraisers, so the process could take some time. Roberts said both companies “are well-served to have clarity for investors about what this really means,” so it shouldn’t drag on too long. The put/call provision was part of the 2019 operational takeover of Hulu by Disney in 2019 in the wake of the $71.3 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox. Founded in 2007, Hulu was always a joint venture, in its later years among Fox, Disney and Comcast/NBCUniversal. While Disney and Comcast have publicly floated the scenario of Comcast buying out Disney’s share, the process has followed the more widely expected path of Disney rolling up full control.

Roberts emphasized that the $27.5 billion minimum valuation “that people have bandied about was just a hypothetical” and will likely to end up far higher. Hulu is “a scarce, kingmaker asset,” he asserted, and worth “way more today than it was” when the parties agreed to the five-year timeline. “Netflix and Hulu are in a class by themselves” as stand-alone streaming outlets, Roberts said. Citing Nielsen data, he said engagement on Hulu is “two to three times” that of rival streamers except for Netflix.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://deadline.com/2023/09/hulu-disney-comcast-stake-sale-timeline-moved-up-streaming-billion-1235537919/""&gt;https://deadline.com/2023/09/hulu-disney-comcast-stake-sale-timeline-moved-up-streaming-billion-1235537919/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Local Law 18, which came into force Tuesday, is so strict it doesn’t just limit how Airbnb operates in the city—it almost bans it entirely for many guests and hosts. From now on, all short-term rental hosts in New York must register with the city, and only those who live in the place they’re renting—and are present when someone is staying—can qualify. And people can only have two guests.

In 2022 alone, short-term rental listings made $85 million in New York.

Airbnb’s attempts to fight back against the new law have, to date, been unsuccessful.

There are currently more than 40,000 Airbnbs in New York, according to Inside Airbnb, which tracks listings on the platform. As of June, 22,434 of those were short-term rentals, defined as places that can be booked for fewer than 30 days.

Ball Corporation's accession to the BAE portfolio expands segments that are experiencing secular growth and is not the result of inefficient capital allocation.  
The tax benefits associated with the Ball transaction have caused the projected price to drop from about $5.5 billion to $4.8 billion. Without synergies, the multiple is estimated to be roughly 15.4x EV/EBITDA. If synergies exist, that multiple can decrease by another 10%. Ball's aerospace sector, which focuses on satellites and geospatial intelligence as well as other sensors and intelligence systems, is not particularly inexpensive but its CAGR is strong enough to justify a double-digit multiple.  
However, considering the more than 4% price drops of BAE Systems since opening, investors have some concerns. Based on the current valuation change, that implies dis-synergy and/or overpayment in the acquisition of around $1.7 billion. $3.5% of $4.8 billion is $1.7 billion. Given that even 15.4x is not that far of a stretch, there is no possibility that a reasonable consideration for Ball would be $3 billion, or in other words, that BAE overpaid by 50%.  
Nevertheless, it makes sense for BAE Systems plc to be increasing internal C&amp;I investment while also engaging in some M&amp;A to mature the firm and position them to offer a next-generation suite of defence technology. As a result, the markets' apparent overreaction to the price decline is significant.

\*\*\*\*\*

Investors are racing to find the clean-energy startups best positioned to capitalize on last year’s landmark climate law. Many are betting on an industry that is seen as crucial to the U.S. ending its reliance on China for batteries.   
  
Major investors including BlackRock BLK -1.45%decrease; red down pointing triangle and Goldman Sachs Asset Management are pouring money into battery recycling, the nascent business of producing reusable battery parts for electric vehicles from scrap metal or old batteries. They are anticipating the startups will survive a turbulent market for clean-energy companies and remain in demand once government incentives dry up.    
  
“That’s the world these companies have to eventually thrive in commercially: one that doesn’t rely on significant subsidies or government support,” said Meghan Sharp, global head of Decarbonization Partners, a joint venture between BlackRock and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings that has raised $1 billion for its first fund and plans to finish fundraising for it this year.   
  
The latest wager is on Ascend Elements, a battery-recycling startup that said it raised $460 million in a financing round that included Decarbonization Partners, mining giant BHP and Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco. The funding round values the company at roughly $1.5 billion.

Last week, rival recycling startup Redwood Materials said it raised $1 billion in a funding round that included Goldman Sachs Asset Management. That put the Nevada-based company’s valuation at more than $5 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.   
  
The investments are among the largest for clean-energy startups this year after battery companies became seen as big winners from the Inflation Reduction Act. Among the incentives giving recyclers and others a boost: tax credits for electric vehicles that are tied to how much material comes from domestic suppliers or trade partners.  
  
Recycling and processing of battery materials are seen as vital industries for the U.S., where environmental opposition and permitting hurdles make the mining of minerals such as nickel and lithium more challenging. China is the top player in the electric-vehicle supply chain, a dominance the U.S. is hoping to shake.  
  
Like many other clean-energy companies, most battery recyclers aren’t yet profitable.   
  
  
That wasn’t a problem for most startups just a few years ago, when interest rates were low and investors were piling into the clean-energy industry. Much of that money has dried up, leaving many startups in areas including indoor farming and electric cars struggling to survive.   
  
Several have filed for bankruptcy in recent weeks, including electric-truck startup Lordstown Motors, indoor-agriculture firm AppHarvest and electric-bus maker Proterra.   
  
The new bets on recycling show that many investors view it as more promising than other early-stage climate industries. The tax incentives for electric cars using domestically sourced parts are brightening Ascend’s business prospects. Recyclers can also take in scrap material as big battery plants expand their operations, an additional boost.   
  
“All of a sudden, it’s really shifted the demand,” said Ascend CEO Mike O’Kronley. “We see this gigantic wave of battery factories coming soon…There needs to be processing capacity on line available to receive that material.”  
  
The Westborough, Mass.-based company was identified last year as a candidate for roughly $480 million in federal grants for battery-material suppliers that were part of the 2021 infrastructure law. Ascend plans to use the grants and its new funding to complete a factory in Kentucky and become profitable soon after it is fully operational in 2025. The company recently signed a $1 billion supply agreement with an undisclosed U.S. customer.  
  
Ascend’s existing investors include South Korea’s SK, one of the world’s biggest battery makers and a major investor in U.S. factories following the climate law.   
  
Other battery recyclers are expecting to benefit from the climate law as well after getting commitments for government loans. Publicly traded Li-Cycle Holdings is expanding a factory in Rochester, N.Y. Redwood, run by Tesla’s former chief technology officer JB Straubel, is building out its Nevada operations and investing $3.5 billion in a new South Carolina plant.   
  
Another perk for clean-energy startups in the climate law: a new market that lets unprofitable companies sell their tax credits to big banks or other businesses.   
  
Renewable-energy developer Invenergy recently agreed to sell $580 million in wind-energy tax credits to Bank of America and used the transaction to raise debt from a group of banks. Similar deals could give companies more funding options.   
  
“You will see more transactions coming soon,” said Meghan Schultz, Invenergy’s chief financial officer.

The prospect of podcast riches led to aggressive investments in celebrity deals and original programming for what appeared a sky’s-the-limit media frontier  
Spotify spent more than $1 billion to build a podcasting empire. It struck splashy deals with Kim Kardashian, the Obamas and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It paid $286 million for a pair of podcast studios and spent $250,000 and more an episode on exclusive shows to lure new listeners.  
The bet hasn’t paid off.   
Most of its shows aren’t profitable, according to people familiar with the matter, and the company has recently cut staff and programming to slow its losses. The company, which has struggled to report consistent profits, lost €527 million, equivalent to about $565 million, in the six months ending in June, on €6.2 billion in revenue.   
No one in the business is making much money on podcasts, but Spotify, which has spent far more on the medium than its rivals, has more to lose than most. Spotify’s competitors, including Amazon, Apple and Google, tech behemoths with their own audiostreaming services, have other, more profitable businesses.

How can you use this to your advantage? It causes enormous volatility when it happens, and that volatility sometimes makes no rational sense.

Why is the volatility happening? ***Lots of fund managers are nothing more than closet indexers.*** They buy or sell an index for their clients, and make a couple tweaks so they can say ""Look! I'm doing something! You need me.. for some reason!""

Look at the winners and losers. It's pretty stark. The ones that got promoted to a bigger index or added to an index are up on the day, some quite a lot. The losers are mostly down, some in the double digits. Some are down 25% !

Well, it might or might not. Do you know any of these companies? Have you researched them? Do you own any? I do. I own one. **I know it well enough to know** ***this daily volatility means nothing to the business.*** There's nothing wrong with the business.

But it does mean something to me. It means I get a fat discount on buying more of the business because managers are engaged in forced selling and buying to rebalance portfolios, ETF's, and funds that track these various indices.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

It's my belief that most people turn into the Boglehead types over time because of their experiences with paying taxes on short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains. Newer investors don't have the experience with dealing with their taxes as much, so they tend to swing for the fences with shorter-term positions.

More seasoned investors tend to buy and hold, but this is a learned behavior because they know that their absolute worst case tax scenario on a long-term gain is 20 percent (federally). Of course, you only pay the 20 percent on long-term cap gains if you're income is over like 492k or something. Most end up paying about 15 percent federal tax on their long-term cap gains. Short-term cap gains seem to be taxed almost double that amount, obviously it depends on your exact tax bracket situation, but you get the point.

Thus, it's been beaten into the heads of seasoned investors that it's just smarter in the long run to hold positions for at least a year, because your tax bill is often cut in half, or almost in half. You do this long enough, and it becomes ingrained in your investing personality.

All of this makes perfect sense to me.

Ok, now let's talk about Roth IRA's. With Roth IRA's, if you're doing things correctly, there's ZERO taxes on your earnings when you're taking your money out. Obviously you need to be 59 1/2 years old and you need to have passed the 5-year rule, etc., etc.

But if ultimately there's no tax implications whatsoever for investments that are under the Roth umbrella, why do most people tend to hold things for the long-term, and be ultraconservative?

**WAIT!**

I already know what you're going to say, but I'm going to argue that it's nonsensical. You're going to say because Roth IRA's are designed for retirement, and when you get up to that age you should be a lot more risk adverse, because you really need this money for your retirement and you can't be screwing around, taking penitentiary chances.

However, here's my argument to that. Consider all of your investments, Roth and normal brokerages as this large bucket of water. Most ~~people~~ investors will have a Roth account and a regular brokerage account. Due the limitations on how much you can get into a Roth each year, it's likely that most people will have at least 5 to 6 times as much money in their regular brokerage accounts as their Roth accounts. For example.... Imagine somebody has 50k grand total in various Roth accounts. Maybe a standard issue Roth and a 401k Roth. But they have 250k in a ""normal"" brokerage account.

In this scenario, less than 17 percent of their overall investment money is in their Roth. So, the argument that they need to be ULTRA CAREFUL WITH THEIR ROTH MONEY is pretty illogical, because it's such a small percentage of their overall scenario.

**Wouldn't it be tremendously more logical to actually trade that 17 percent of their account more aggressively, when it's the only 17 percent that isn't negatively affected by moving in and out of stocks?**

Think about the guy that has Microsoft stock. Been holding MSFT for years. He knows the ups and downs. The peaks and valleys. He can probably tell you countless times he would have taken profits if only there wasn't a major tax consequence. So, he doesn't take profits when the stock gets ahead of itself, and then buy back in during a retracement. But his reasoning is tax implications. Inside a Roth, there's no tax implications. Thus, this same investor could sell out of MSFT when he thinks it's gotten ahead of itself, and then buy back in during a retracement and end up with more overall shares. All with no taxable implications whatsoever.

Now obviously, nobody can predict the future and sometimes people are going to get it wrong. They'll sell MSFT when they think the stock has gotten way ahead of itself and then it continues to go on a tear and now he can't buy back in and still have the same number of shares.

But by the same token, just talk to any Amazon investor over the last three years. That shit has basically gone pretty much nowhere for a three-year period. So the whole buy and hold forever strategy hasn't worked out that great for AMZN holders.

I currently have a managed account and recently became aware of the fees eating up my investments. Furthermore, my advisor mostly invests in individual stocks, which feels risky to me. Coming in with little knowledge, I just sent money to him to invest, since he handles my family members' accounts.

I would like to open an account where I purchase index funds.  If I keep the managed account while simultaneously having a separate index fund account, is this risky in terms of tax implications or costs or other issues?

I would prefer not to dump my managed account right away, as I am new to the idea of strategic investing and it feels intimidating to take this chunk of money that is managed and right away invest it myself.

I have heard that ""Washing"" can be an issue. If my advisor invests in a particular stock that also wind up as part of an index I purchase in a separate account, could this be a problem, if he sells that managed stock?

Excuse my ignorance. Trying to make the best decisions over the long haul as currently learn. Any thoughts appreciated

308,stocks,"Hey, I wanted to share my thoughts on a financial metric: Return On Equity. Return on equity calculation is: *Net income/Shareholders Equity.* **I believe Return on Equity is useful, however it can mislead investors if you do not understand its limits. Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) is better for assessing earning power.**

For example, if company A generates $20,000 in income and has $100,000 in equity, then return on equity is 20%. If company B generates $20,000 in income and has $200,000 in equity, then return on equity is 10%. Based on the above example, Company A is more efficient and requires fewer capital to generate the same profit as Company B.

*However...*

*COMPANY A BALANCE SHEET*

|**Assets**|$1,000,000|
|:-|:-|
|**Liabilities**|$900,000|

For Company A, If we add assets and subtract it by liabilities: Equity is $100,000. However, liabilities represent 90% of total assets (*$900,000/$100,000).* Debt to Equity ratio would be: **9.**

*COMPANY B BALANCE SHEET*

|**Assets**|$300,000|
|:-|:-|
|**Liabilities**|$100,000|

For company B, if we add assets and subtract it by liabilities: Equity is $200,000. However, liabilities only represent 33% of total assets *($100,000/$200,000).* Debt to Equity ratio would be **0.5.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This explains why companies like Caterpillar (42% ROE) appears more profitable than Alphabet (23%). Or Nordstrom (33% ROE) compared with META (18%). ROE is higher for the former two not because they have more earning power, but because they are far more leveraged *(carry more debt).*

**Conclusion:**

Make sure you are checking the health of a company's balance sheet before comparing ROE between two companies in the same industry. This is why I think ROE is overrated and prefer to use ROIC instead.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, I wanted to share my thoughts on a financial metric: Return On Equity.

In that post, I included some very gloomy datapoints about how the UK economy has stagnated relative to its EU / G7 peers. Well, perhaps the gloom was overly stated.

I'll include snippets from the [FT article here](https://www.ft.com/content/50386cc2-003b-4af1-946b-cf3243da810f).

&gt;  Official statistics on Friday **added almost 2 per cent to the size of the UK economy**, in a surprise move that showed the country recovered much faster from the pandemic than previously reported. [...]

&gt; The changes reveal that, by the end of 2021, the country’s economy was **0.6 per cent larger than pre-pandemic levels** — instead of 1.2 per cent smaller, as previously estimated. [...] [And, going to the most recent data in 2023, it is estimated to be 1.6% larger instead of 0.2% smaller]

&gt; In a preview of new national accounts data to be included in official figures from October, the ONS said it had uncovered big sources of growth it had previously not taken account of, particularly as the economy recovered from the pandemic in 2021


&gt; As recently as mid August, official data reflected ONS estimates that the economy had still not reached its pre-pandemic level, even by the second quarter of this year.

 &gt; But, after the revisions are included in official figures in October, they will show that the UK economy recovered from the pandemic in late 2021, **a recovery as strong as France’s and better than Germany’s**.

&gt; That will add the equivalent of **two years of current UK growth** to the country’s gross domestic product. 

There were modifications to the Covid growth plunge:

&gt;  The ONS now says the economic contraction at the height of the Covid crisis in 2020 was not as deep as previously thought. It found that companies had been adding to piles of unsold stocks rather than running them down, as previously thought. 

&gt; That accumulation of stock caused a £14bn upward revision to the level of real gross domestic product for 2022. As a result, **GDP is estimated to have slumped by 10.4 per cent in 2020 rather than 11 per cent**. The fall that year still qualifies as the worst annual contraction since the “great frost” of 1709.

Other mismeasurements found were in health care:

&gt; The ONS also discovered that wholesale companies and the health sector produced much more in 2021 than previously thought.
&gt; 
&gt; The revision was largely due to higher margins as Covid curbs eased, which boosted income, profits and ultimately GDP.
&gt; 
&gt; The ONS update corrects a previous anomaly, in which huge amounts of extra money was being spent in healthcare over the pandemic but measured output did not rise accordingly. This also meant GDP was significantly higher than previously thought.



[Graph 1 of the revisions](https://i.imgur.com/ML374wR.png).

[Graph 2 showing comparisons](https://i.imgur.com/Bvc5goS.png) to other G7 countries. Go to the actual article to hover over the other countries. It's hard to see from the screenshot, but Germany is now the biggest laggard, and ahead of the revised UK is France (barely), Italy, Japan, Canada, and the UK. The UK is now 1.6% higher than pre-pandemic, while the US is up 6.1%, Canada +3.7% (not fully up to date), Japan +3.4%, Italy +2.1%, France +1.7%, and Germany +0.2%.

In my view, this increases my viewpoint that yes, the UK stock market is mispriced. No I don't think there are any shenanigans with the data, simply that measuring the aggregate output of an entire economy is hard.

318,stocks,"I plan on adding a soft drink company to my portfolio, because I don't feel like adding up on my positions, which are quite pricy, nor buying something like the QQQ or any growth fund which would increasingly expose me to tech.

The three choices are obviously Coca Cola, Pespsi and Monster.

Coca cola is the one trading at the lowest multiple, paying the highest dividend, and arguably the one with stronger brand recognition. I really like the fact that they are deleverging and consistently paying off their debt, however the growth has been lagging behind. Has less than half the revenues of Pepsi does (43bln vs 92 bln), but just over twice the net margins. I would say its the safest play.

Pepsi has done I think decent acquistions ( ex, Doctor Pepper ), and is growing slightly faster than Coke with a lower dividend. Very stable growth, a fair amount of debt (nothing too concerning). 

Monster growth has been, well, Monstrous. However the PE is 41 (10 more than pepsi, 16 more than coke), and since they never paid dividend the balance-sheet looks incredible. They have more cash than all liabilities, and are already doing buybacks, which for fast growing company is quite nice,as it means they can already return capital to shareholders while expanding operations, without using debt. I am not saying it is undervalued (PE 41), but given the current multiples and its track record, it doesn't seem too bad. The brand doesn't have the same track record of the other two, but is well known and the managment seems to know how to keep it relevant and in touch with consumers preferences. I don't think its going away (stressed overworked people needs energy drinks haha) but the future might be more uncertain than with the other two.

What are your thoughts on these companies?

329,stocks,"The per barrel price for the WTI grade of crude oil reached $85 on Friday—the highest price point yet this year as falling inventory levels spook the market.  
  
WTI crude oil briefly reached $85 per barrel before sagging to $84.90 around 10:00 a.m. ET. The last time WTI traded at a level that high was November 2022.

For the day, WTI was trading up $1.33 per barrel, or 1.59%.  
  
Brent crude oil was also trading up on the day, by $1.05 per barrel, or 1.21%, at $87.88—also a new 2023 record.  
  
A big factor in the rising price of crude oil are the falling inventories in the United States, which dipped another 10.6 million barrels according to the Energy Information Administration for the week ending August 25.  
  
Another contributing factor to strong oil prices is the OPEC+ alliance, which includes heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Russia. The duo has reached a deal concerning production cuts, for which Russia has said it will provide details next week. The market is weighing the likelihood that Saudi Arabia or Russia could extend or deepen their current production cuts. More analysts than not expect that Saudi Arabia will extend its 1 million bpd production cut into October.  
A third support under oil prices is the weakening dollar, which makes crude oil more affordable for non-dollar holders, thereby stimulating demand.  
  
The price rise will make it more difficult for the Biden Administration to continue the painstakingly slow process of refilling the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which has grown by an average of 600,000 barrels per week for the last few weeks, after draining 300 million barrels out of the SPR over the last few years.  
  
Despite the 300 million barrels leaving the SPR and going into commercial inventories, crude oil inventories—excluding that in the SPR—are more than 100 million barrels shy of July 2020 levels.

Cable giant Charter Communications and Disney are in a battle over contract fees that has left millions of people without access to U.S. Open, college football and potentially “Monday Night Football,” with the NFL’s season starting in just days. On Thursday, Disney said that the two companies have been in ongoing negotiations but yet to agree to a new deal. That resulted in Charter’s customers losing access to its networks, including broadcaster ABC and pay-TV channels such as ESPN and FX. Charter and Disney’s stocks were each down more than 2% on Friday. Charter’s Spectrum TV service has roughly 14.7 million customers across 41 states, with some of its top TV markets being New York, Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta.

These sorts of battles, which can lead to so-called blackouts for pay-TV customers, are common in the industry. But, in the age of streaming, this one is different. “This is not a typical carriage dispute,” Charter CEO Chris Winfrey said Friday on a call with investors. Early Friday, Charter executives called the pay-TV ecosystem “broken.” They said they pushed for a revamped deal with Disney that would see Charter cable customers receive access to Disney’s ad-supported streaming services like Disney+ and ESPN+ at no additional cost. This seemed to be the sticking point as Charter said it accepted Disney’s request for higher fees, although Charter executives didn’t provide specifics on the negotiations as they remain hopeful to get a deal done. Winfrey noted that in the last five years the entire pay-TV ecosystem has lost nearly 25 million customers, or almost 25% of total industry customers. “It’s staggering,” he said.

Between the high cost of the traditional bundle and the option to switch to more affordable streaming options – most of which are provided by the same companies behind the networks on pay-TV – the speed at which cord-cutting is only accelerating. Live sports, particularly those shown on ESPN, have long been considered the glue holding the pay-TV bundle together, especially as customers flee for streaming services. The two companies renewed their contract in 2019, which also included Charter integrating Disney+ and ESPN+, as well as Hulu, into its set-top boxes to give customers more seamless access to those apps, CNBC previously reported. Charter, which also provides broadband and mobile services but is not in the content business, has said it values its pay-TV business and wants to see it thrive, even if it takes on a different form than the past.

Disney CEO Bob Iger recently said on CNBC that assessing its traditional TV business is at the top of his list, and opened the door to potentially unloading these assets in a sale. The CEO, who returned to the helm late last year, said he realized the company is facing a lot of challenges, many of which are “self-inflicted.” Iger did note that ESPN is in a different bucket and Disney was instead open to selling a stake in the network while also moving toward a direct-to-consumer streaming service of its live feed.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/01/disney-charter-battle-over-spectrum-blackout.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/01/disney-charter-battle-over-spectrum-blackout.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

&lt;p&gt;Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you&amp;#39;re holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Matthew Pfau: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to first start on the restatement, and I was just hoping you could better explain to us what happened here from an accounting perspective. It seems a little bit counterintuitive that both inventory and would be overstated while COGS were understated. So what happened that drove that? And then on the cash component, how did that sort of tie out when the accounting was wrong on the other side of the financial statements.

Kevin Buchel: So Matt, the inventory for the quarters that succeeded the June 30, 2022 physical inventory audited statements, the quarters that followed it, which was the September quarter the December quarter and the March quarter of fiscal 2023. The inventory was valued using values from the 6/30/22 audited numbers. What that means is take as an example, if a component was valued at $50 at June 30, 2022. That same $50 was used to value the inventory for the first quarter, and let’s say, the second quarter and let’s say, the third quarter. The cost of that component was coming down, no longer $50, $5 using this one example. You value the inventory at $50, you’re overstating your inventory when you put a valuation on your balance sheet.

If you’re overstating your inventory and your balance sheet, that means the other side of the equation is you’re understating your cost of goods sold. It has nothing to do with cash. This is all book entries Cash is unaffected. Cash flow unaffected cash from ops, none of that is affected. This is strictly overstated your inventory – it means you understated your cost of goods sold. If you understated, your cost of goods sold, that means you overstated your net income. And that’s what it is now. we’re going to fix this, and we’ve begun the process of fixing it. You can’t use the prior year’s physical inventory valuation going forward. normal conditions, it could use it, but in fluctuating pricing times and who knows what the times are going to be going forward times seem to be better now, the fluctuations seem to be gone.

But we’re going to have a system where we measure every fluctuation during the quarters and we utilize that new price if there is a new price to value the inventory in each quarter. We’ll do it at the beginning the first day after the quarter end, so on October 1, let’s say, for the upcoming end of the quarter, we’ll measure every fluctuation that exists up or down and we’ll make sure that the inventory valuation for the quarter utilizes the correct price. And that’s the best way I could explain it, Matt. It’s nothing to do with cash for those that took accounting in school, it’s – you’ve got to credit your inventory, lower your inventory, you’ve got to debit your cost of goods sold, and that reduces profits. That’s what it was.

Matthew Pfau: Got it. And then with the stock down significantly from the highs, are you considering repurchasing any stock or is management team considering any personal purchases themselves?

Kevin Buchel: That’s all on the table. And it’s possible we will do that. The first things first, let’s get the Qs, the restated Qs filed. We expect to do that this week. Let’s get the K filed. We expect to do that next week. And then we could look at buybacks and personal buying all this it’s all on the table. Let’s get this – our house in order with our filings and we go from there.

344,stocks,"# INTRODUCTION:

MTCH the parent company for a large number of successful dating apps e.g. Tinder, Hinge and OkCupid, their growth has grinded to a halt recently with a very unique business model where the more successful/effective their product is the more subscribers they lose. Management has laid out several game plans such as increasing marketing spend, releasing higher priced tier e.g. HingeX and Price &amp; Margin Optimization through removing introduction &amp; discount pricing.   


# REVENUE:

The largest difficulty I faced when forecasting subscribers for MTCH is their unique business model. However, good dating apps are able to grow faster than their subscribers churn as the word of mouth advertisement and successful couples being a walking billboard for them are all a crucial part of the business model of MTCH. So, when creating a revenue model I was under the assumption that the churn isn’t to a significant amount. I believe it's much less accurate to try and forecast churn into my “older” subscribers and project from there as I’d be making far bolder assumptions than simply assuming subscribers grow at a faster pace than churn.  
  
The direction for revenue that management is taking is “longer term…We'll essentially have fewer payers but at higher price points.” - 2022 Q4 Earnings Conference.  
  
Factors affecting the growth rate of revenue/payers and amount of payers is “Prevalence of smartphones in the market” and “affluence of the market”. ([SOURCE](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/App-makers-cash-in-as-Southeast-Asia-falls-for-mobile-dating))   
APAC Payers growth is very dependent on consumers getting smartphones or pivoting from traditional methods of dating e.g. Matchmaker or arranged marriage, which is especially prevalent in India ([SOURCE](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59530706)). So due to the difference in consumption patterns, I’ll forecast America and Europe with similar trends. Whereas APAC and others follow a separate trend.   
But for all regions I'll assume that they follow historic trends of either meager increase or decline for the next 2 years as macro trends continue for the next 2 years, before improving for the better as macro conditions improve.  
  
For America and Europe,  
  
To forecast Y/Y payers,   
As the macro environment changes for the better, America and Europe Y/Y payers will get a slight increase in growth at similar levels as 2021 where economic conditions were the most favorable for the next 3 years before tapering off for the rest of my forecast.  
  
To forecast Y/Y revenue/payers,   
I assume that revenue/payers will get a bump as MTCH better optimize their prices either through a higher paid tier or better pricing/less discounts. Which is a direction management wants to take as stated on their Q4 2022 Earnings Conference.  
  
For APAC and Others,  
  
I believe the explosive growth historically will not sustain as this explosive growth is a low hanging fruit, mainly people who are curious and the most willing to try dating apps. It’ll take about 6 years for MTCH’s products to catch on as consumers will require a cultural shift and overcome the difficulties as stated above facing this region. So from then on, MTCH could start charging a higher price.   
  
For Indirect Revenue, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of subscription revenue as the success of indirect revenue comes from how well subscription does.  
  
REVENUE MODEL: \[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/JIFQay0)\]  


# COST:

COGS comes from e.g. Customer care, hosting fees &amp; in-app purchase fees etc. Given that MTCH's cash cows e.g. tinder and hinge are mainly on the app store, this means that the largest COGS should be in app processing fees. Opting for less granularity, I’ll assume that COGS will tend towards 30% of Revenue as the app store collects 30% from the sale of in app purchases.   
  
***Marketing,***

Management has stated that they have overhired and would like to optimize margins.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately at base case I value MTCH at $56.94. I don’t necessarily agree with management’s plans moving forward on how they plan on growing through higher marketing spend. A good dating app should mainly grow through word of mouth as it shows that churned users are satisfied with the services provided and are living proof of the effectiveness of the app. I do see higher priced tier being a viable solution especially with users who are impatient or need a bump, but the removal of introductory pricing may cause an issue as a dating app may not be worth spending a lot of money on till users can see its worth proven either through word of mouth or trying their services at a low initial commitment.  


Worst Case: \[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/Cr3niM2)\]  
Base Case: \[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/SEj9bta)\]  
Best Case: \[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/JxtXugt)\]  
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;INTRODUCTION:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MTCH the parent company for a large number of successful dating apps e.g. Tinder, Hinge and OkCupid, their growth has grinded to a halt recently with a very unique business model where the more successful/effective their product is the more subscribers they lose. Management has laid out several game plans such as increasing marketing spend, releasing higher priced tier e.g. HingeX and Price &amp;amp; Margin Optimization through removing introduction &amp;amp; discount pricing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REVENUE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest difficulty I faced when forecasting subscribers for MTCH is their unique business model. However, good dating apps are able to grow faster than their subscribers churn as the word of mouth advertisement and successful couples being a walking billboard for them are all a crucial part of the business model of MTCH. So, when creating a revenue model I was under the assumption that the churn isn’t to a significant amount. I believe it&amp;#39;s much less accurate to try and forecast churn into my “older” subscribers and project from there as I’d be making far bolder assumptions than simply assuming subscribers grow at a faster pace than churn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The direction for revenue that management is taking is “longer term…We&amp;#39;ll essentially have fewer payers but at higher price points.” - 2022 Q4 Earnings Conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factors affecting the growth rate of revenue/payers and amount of payers is “Prevalence of smartphones in the market” and “affluence of the market”. (&lt;a href=""https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/App-makers-cash-in-as-Southeast-Asia-falls-for-mobile-dating""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APAC Payers growth is very dependent on consumers getting smartphones or pivoting from traditional methods of dating e.g. Matchmaker or arranged marriage, which is especially prevalent in India (&lt;a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59530706""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;). So due to the difference in consumption patterns, I’ll forecast America and Europe with similar trends. Whereas APAC and others follow a separate trend.&lt;br/&gt;
But for all regions I&amp;#39;ll assume that they follow historic trends of either meager increase or decline for the next 2 years as macro trends continue for the next 2 years, before improving for the better as macro conditions improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For America and Europe,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To forecast Y/Y payers, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the macro environment changes for the better, America and Europe Y/Y payers will get a slight increase in growth at similar levels as 2021 where economic conditions were the most favorable for the next 3 years before tapering off for the rest of my forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To forecast Y/Y revenue/payers, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume that revenue/payers will get a bump as MTCH better optimize their prices either through a higher paid tier or better pricing/less discounts. Which is a direction management wants to take as stated on their Q4 2022 Earnings Conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For APAC and Others,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the explosive growth historically will not sustain as this explosive growth is a low hanging fruit, mainly people who are curious and the most willing to try dating apps. It’ll take about 6 years for MTCH’s products to catch on as consumers will require a cultural shift and overcome the difficulties as stated above facing this region. So from then on, MTCH could start charging a higher price.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Indirect Revenue, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of subscription revenue as the success of indirect revenue comes from how well subscription does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REVENUE MODEL: [&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/JIFQay0""&gt;INSERT&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COST:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COGS comes from e.g. Customer care, hosting fees &amp;amp; in-app purchase fees etc. Given that MTCH&amp;#39;s cash cows e.g. tinder and hinge are mainly on the app store, this means that the largest COGS should be in app processing fees. Opting for less granularity, I’ll assume that COGS will tend towards 30% of Revenue as the app store collects 30% from the sale of in app purchases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marketing,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management has stated their intent to increase marketing spend, I’ll assume that they have elevated marketing spend for the next 2 years. Remaining at historic levels for the next 5 years before tapering down. Management does not need to go overboard with marketing spend given that the business model of dating apps is that they spread mainly through word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;G&amp;amp;A,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management has stated that they have overhired and would like to optimize margins. I&amp;#39;d assume G&amp;amp;A spend remains at a constant nominal amount for the next 2 years before the economy picks up again and the demand for dating apps rises which allows MTCH to hire more people for the next 3 years before tapering down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;R&amp;amp;D,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll assume that R&amp;amp;D expenditure follows historic trends to avoid being overly granular.&lt;/p&gt;

[https://www.marijuanamoment.net/top-federal-health-agency-says-marijuana-should-be-moved-to-schedule-iii-in-historic-recommendation-to-dea/](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/top-federal-health-agency-says-marijuana-should-be-moved-to-schedule-iii-in-historic-recommendation-to-dea/)

&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is officially recommending that marijuana be moved from Schedule I to Schedule III under federal law—a historic development that means the top health agency no longer considers cannabis to be a drug with high abuse potential and no medical value.  
&gt;  
&gt;After completing a scientific review into cannabis under a directive from President Joe Biden last year, HHS is now telling the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that it believes marijuana should be placed in Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The recommendation is not binding, and DEA has the final say, but the scientific analysis combined with growing political support for cannabis reform may well influence DEA to make the change.

Nearly one year ago (October 2022), Biden tasked the AG and HHS to review cannabis' schedule on the controlled substances act. It has been long speculated that the intention of the Biden administration has been to reschedule cannabis shortly before the 2024 election. Over the past few months, rumors emerged that the federal government is targeting schedule 3 for cannabis. Today, we received confirmation of that intention as well as seeing another domino fall in the process to remove cannabis from schedule 1 status with the HHS officially recommending its move to schedule 3.

Today's action is the most significant move on the federal level for cannabis reform since cannabis became schedule 1 back in 1970. The ball is now in the DEA's court. They typically respond to these review requests in \~3 months, and rely on the scientific and medical research of federal agencies such as HHS for their decision making. This would set us up to see cannabis likely rescheduled in Q1 of 2024, lining up nicely with the election.

This would have tremendous impact on the US cannabis companies which currently face regulatory hurdles that are unheard of in other sectors. These companies are paying 70-80% tax rates as they are unable to deduct normal business expenses due to 280E, which only applies to schedule 1 and 2 substances. Schedule 3 would eliminate this tax burden and make many of these companies profitable overnight. It would also remove hurdles in terms of access to the federal banking system and would ultimately allow these companies to uplist to the major US exchanges such as the NASDAQ and NYSE. Currently these stocks trade on the CSE, a small Canadian stock exchange that is heavily manipulated and illiquid.

On Friday August 25th, [Elon Musk posted a video on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1695247110030119054?s=46&amp;t=0YLBKtmQe8-F_nJ00NQvxg), that now has 44 million views, of him driving a Tesla on autopilot. In the video he has to brake the car himself when it almost runs a red light (at around 19:45). It also received a decent amount of news coverage. 

This appears to have not affected the stock’s value at all and as of the closing today (August 29th) the stock is up over 7%

I’d expect such an incident to have negative effects on a company’s value, but this didn’t. 

Are these sorts of things usually just not big deals? 

If Apple were demonstrating their new iPhone’s amazing app that works perfectly and then it caused the phone to crash, would that negatively affect the value?

Or is it basically all just about the money that the company brings in?

—— 

Thanks to everybody who answered nicely. I’ve gotten some explanations that make sense including:

- Elon’s livestream video wasn’t of current autopilot software on Teslas, but rather a beta FSD which performed very well. 
- 44 million people probably didn’t actually see that moment where “human intervention” takes place. Plus the media blew it out of proportion. 
- Computer trading algorithms don’t care about these minute things. 
- This isn’t exclusive to Tesla. Similar things like this happening to other gigantic companies happen and they barely matter. 
- The market overall went up on the 29th and Tesla has a high beta.

368,stocks,"The world could face a shortage for lithium as demand for the metal ramps up, with some analysts forecasting that it could come as soon as 2025. Others, however, see a longer time frame before that shortfall hits.

BMI, a Fitch Solutions research unit, was among those that predict a lithium supply deficit by 2025. In a recently published report, BMI largely attributed the deficit to China’s lithium demand exceeding that of its supply.

“We expect an average of 20.4% year-on-year annual growth for China’s lithium demand for EVs alone over 2023-2032,” the report stated. 

In contrast, China’s lithium supply will only grow 6% over the same period, BMI said, adding that rate cannot satiate even one third of forecasted demand.

The world produced 540,000 metric tons of lithium in 2021, and by 2030 the World Economic Forum projects that global demand will reach over 3 million metric tons.

I want to start regularly buying IRA stock. I'll just follow the market, so S&amp;P 500 sounds good. But I found out I could buy triple leveraged S&amp;P 500.

According to google, since UPRO's (triple leveraged S&amp;P 500) inception in June 2009 it's increased 3,592%. Currently, E/R of .91%.

According to google, since June 2009 SWPPX (Schwab S&amp;P 500 Index Fund) has increased 371%. Currently, E/R of .02%.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering that UPRO has increased approximately 10 faster than SWPPX over the last 14 years, it seems to outweigh the approximately 45 times higher E/R that UPRO has over SWPPX.

&lt;p&gt;According to google, since June 2009 SWPPX (Schwab S&amp;amp;P 500 Index Fund) has increased 371%. Currently, E/R of .02%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that UPRO has increased approximately 10 faster than SWPPX over the last 14 years, it seems to outweigh the approximately 45 times higher E/R that UPRO has over SWPPX.&lt;/p&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

&gt;*Germany Is Losing Its Mojo. Finding It Again Won’t Be Easy.*

&gt;*BERLIN—Two decades ago, Germany revived its moribund economy and became a manufacturing powerhouse of an era of globalization.*

&gt;*Times changed. Germany didn’t keep up. Now Europe’s biggest economy has to reinvent itself again. But its fractured political class is struggling to find answers to a dizzying conjunction of long-term headaches and short-term crises, leading to a growing sense of malaise.*

&gt;*Germany will be the world’s only major economy to contract in 2023, with even sanctioned Russia experiencing growth, according to the International Monetary Fund.*

Germany’s reliance on manufacturing and world trade has made it particularly vulnerable to recent global turbulence: supply-chain disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic, surging energy prices after Russia invaded Ukraine, and the rise in inflation and interest rates that have led to a global slowdown.

At Germany’s biggest carmaker Volkswagen, top executives shared a dire assessment on an internal conference call in July, according to people familiar with the event. Exploding costs, falling demand and new rivals such as Tesla and Chinese electric-car makers are making for a “perfect storm,” a divisional chief told his colleagues, adding: “The roof is on fire.”

The problems aren’t new. Germany’s manufacturing output and its gross domestic product have stagnated since 2018, suggesting that its long-successful model has lost its mojo.

China was for years a major driver of Germany’s export boom. A rapidly industrializing China bought up all the capital goods that Germany could make. But China’s investment-heavy growth model has been approaching its limits for years. Growth and demand for imports have faltered.

Instead of Germany’s best customers, Chinese industries have become aggressive competitors. Upstart Chinese carmakers are competing with German incumbents such as VW that are lagging in the electric-vehicle revolution.

More broadly, the world has become less favorable to the kind of open trade that benefited Germany. The shift was expressed most clearly in then-President Donald Trump imposing tariffs not only on imports from China but also those of U.S. allies in Europe. The U.K.’s 2016 decision to leave the European Union and Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, leading to EU sanctions, also signaled a shift toward a more hostile environment for big exporters.

Germany’s long industrial boom led to complacency about its domestic weaknesses, from an aging labor force to sclerotic services sectors and mounting bureaucracy. The country was doing better at supporting old industries such as cars, machinery and chemicals than at fostering new ones, such as digital technology. Germany’s only major software company, SAP, was founded in 1975.

Years of skimping on public investment have led to fraying infrastructure, an increasingly mediocre education system and poor high-speed internet and mobile-phone connectivity compared with other advanced economies.

Germany’s once-efficient trains have become a byword for lateness. The public administration’s continued reliance on fax machines became a national joke. Even the national soccer teams are being routinely beaten.

“We’ve kind of slept through a decade or so of challenges,” said Moritz Schularick, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

In March, one of Germany’s most storied companies, multinational industrial-gas group Linde, delisted from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in favor of maintaining a sole listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The decision was driven in part by the growing burden of financial regulation in Germany. But also, Linde, whose roots go back to 1879, said it no longer wanted to be perceived just as German—an association that it believed was depressing its appeal to investors.

Germany today is in the midst of another cycle of success, stagnation and pressure for reforms, said Josef Joffe, a longtime newspaper publisher and a fellow at Stanford University.

“Germany will bounce back, but it suffers from two longer-term ailments: above all its failure to transform an old-industry system into a knowledge economy, and an irrational energy policy,” Joffe said.

“I think it’s important to remember that Germany is still a global leader,” German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said in an interview. “We’re the world’s fourth-largest economy. We have the economic know-how and I’m proud of our skilled workforce. But at the moment, we are not as competitive as we could be,” he said.

Germany still has many strengths. Its deep reservoir of technical and engineering know-how and its specialty in capital goods still put it in a position to profit from future growth in many emerging economies. Its labor-market reforms have greatly improved the share of the population that has a job. The national debt is lower than that of most of its peers and financial markets view its bonds as among the world’s safest assets.

The country’s challenges now are less severe than they were in the 1990s, after German reunification, said Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg Bank in Hamburg.

Back then, Germany was struggling with the massive costs of integrating the former Communist east. Rising global competition and rigid labor laws were contributing to high unemployment. Spending on social benefits ballooned. Too many people depended on welfare, while too few workers paid for it. German reliance on manufacturing was seen as old-fashioned at a time when other countries were betting on e-commerce and financial services.

After a period of national angst, then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder pared back welfare entitlements, deregulated parts of the labor market and pressured the unemployed to take available jobs. The controversial reforms split Schröder’s Social Democrats, and he fell from power.

Private-sector changes were as important as government measures. German companies cooperated with employees to make working practices more flexible. Unions agreed to forgo pay raises in return for keeping factories and jobs in Germany.

Germany Inc. grew leaner. Meanwhile, the world was demanding more of what Germans were good at making, including capital goods and luxury cars.

China’s sweeping investments in industrial capacity powered the sales of machine-tool makers in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. VW invested heavily in China, tapping newly affluent consumers’ appetite for German cars.

Schröder’s successor, longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel, presided over years of growth with little pressure for further unpopular overhauls. Booming exports to developing countries helped Germany bounce back from the 2008 global financial crisis better than many other Western countries.

Complacency crept in. Service sectors, which made up the bulk of gross domestic product and jobs, were less dynamic than export-oriented manufacturers. Wage restraint sapped consumer demand. German companies saved rather than invested much of their profits.

Successful exporters became reluctant to change. German suppliers of automotive components were so confident of their strength that many dismissed warnings that electric vehicles would soon challenge the internal combustion engine. After failing to invest in batteries and other technology for new-generation cars, many now find themselves overtaken by Chinese upstarts.

A recent study by PwC found that German auto suppliers, partly through reluctance to change, have suffered a loss of global market share since 2019 as big as their gains in the previous two decades.

More German businesses are complaining of the growing density of red tape.

BioNTech, a lauded biotech firm that developed the Covid-19 vaccine produced in partnership with Pfizer, recently decided to move some research and clinical-trial activities to the U.K. because of Germany’s restrictive rules on data protection.

German privacy laws made it impossible to run key studies for cancer cures, BioNTech’s co-founder Ugur Sahin said recently. German approvals processes for new treatments, which were accelerated during the pandemic, have reverted to their sluggish pace, he said.

Germany ought to be among the nations winning from advances in medical science, said Hans Georg Näder, chairman of Ottobock, a leading maker of high-tech artificial limbs. Instead, operating in Germany is getting evermore difficult thanks to new regulations, he said.

One recent law required all German manufacturers to vouch for the environment, legal and ethical credentials of every component’s supplier, requiring even smaller companies to perform due diligence on many foreign firms, often based overseas, such as in China.

Näder said his company must now scrutinize thousands of business partners, from software developers to makers of tiny metal screws, to comply with regulation. Ottobock decided to open its latest factory in Bulgaria instead of Germany.

Energy costs are posing an existential challenge to sectors such as chemicals. Russia’s war on Ukraine has exposed Germany’s costly bet on Russian gas to help fill a gap left by the decision to shut down nuclear power plants.

German politicians dismissed warnings that Russian President Vladimir Putin used gas for geopolitical leverage, saying Moscow had always been a reliable supplier. After Putin invaded Ukraine, he throttled gas deliveries to Germany in an attempt to deter European support for Kyiv.

Energy prices in Europe have declined from last year’s peak as EU countries scrambled to replace Russian gas, but German industry still faces higher costs than competitors in the U.S. and Asia.

German executives’ other complaints include a lack of skilled workers, complex immigration rules that make it hard to bring qualified workers from abroad and spotty telecommunications and digital infrastructure.

“Our home market fills us with more and more concern,” Martin Brudermüller, chief executive of chemicals giant BASF, said at his annual shareholders’ meeting in April. “Profitability is no longer anywhere near where it should be,” he said.

One problem Germany can’t fix quickly is demographics. A shrinking labor force has left an estimated two million jobs unfilled. Some 43% of German businesses are struggling to find workers, with the average time for hiring someone approaching six months.

Germany’s fragmented political landscape makes it harder to enact far-reaching changes like the country did 20 years ago. In common with much of Europe, established center-right and center-left parties have lost their electoral dominance. The number of parties in Germany’s parliament has risen steadily.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his Social Democrats lead an unwieldy governing coalition whose members often have diametrically opposed views on the way forward. The Free Democrats want to cut taxes, while the Greens would like to raise them. Left-leaning ministers want to greatly raise public investment spending, financed by borrowing if needed, but finance chief Lindner rejects that. “We need fiscal prudence,” Lindner said.

Senior government members accept the need to cut red tape, as well as for an overhaul of Germany’s energy supply and infrastructure. But party differences often hold up even modest changes. This month the Greens lifted a veto of Lindner’s proposal to reduce business taxes only after they extracted consent for more welfare spending. As part of the deal, the government agreed to pass another law drafted by one of Lindner’s allies, Justice Minister Marco Buschmann, to trim regulation for businesses.

Scholz recently rejected gloomy predictions about Germany. Changes are needed but not a fundamental overhaul of the export-led model that has served Germany well throughout the post-World War II era, he said in an interview on national TV recently.

He cited the inflow of foreign investment into the microchips sector by companies such as Intel, helped by generous government subsidies. Scholz said planned changes to immigration rules, including making it easier to qualify for German citizenship, would help attract more skilled workers.

But Scholz has struggled to stop the infighting in his coalition. The government’s approval ratings have tanked, and the far-right populist Alternative for Germany party has overtaken Scholz’s Social Democrats in opinion polls.

“The country is being led by a bunch of Keystone Kops, a motley coalition that can’t get its act together,” Joffe said.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/germany-is-losing-its-mojo-finding-it-again-wont-be-easy-c4b46761""&gt;https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/germany-is-losing-its-mojo-finding-it-again-wont-be-easy-c4b46761&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country’s challenges now are less severe than they were in the 1990s, after German reunification, said Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg Bank in Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back then, Germany was struggling with the massive costs of integrating the former Communist east. Rising global competition and rigid labor laws were contributing to high unemployment. Spending on social benefits ballooned. Too many people depended on welfare, while too few workers paid for it. German reliance on manufacturing was seen as old-fashioned at a time when other countries were betting on e-commerce and financial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a period of national angst, then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder pared back welfare entitlements, deregulated parts of the labor market and pressured the unemployed to take available jobs. The controversial reforms split Schröder’s Social Democrats, and he fell from power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private-sector changes were as important as government measures. German companies cooperated with employees to make working practices more flexible. Unions agreed to forgo pay raises in return for keeping factories and jobs in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany Inc. grew leaner. Meanwhile, the world was demanding more of what Germans were good at making, including capital goods and luxury cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s sweeping investments in industrial capacity powered the sales of machine-tool makers in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. VW invested heavily in China, tapping newly affluent consumers’ appetite for German cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schröder’s successor, longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel, presided over years of growth with little pressure for further unpopular overhauls. Booming exports to developing countries helped Germany bounce back from the 2008 global financial crisis better than many other Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complacency crept in. Service sectors, which made up the bulk of gross domestic product and jobs, were less dynamic than export-oriented manufacturers. Wage restraint sapped consumer demand. German companies saved rather than invested much of their profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful exporters became reluctant to change. German suppliers of automotive components were so confident of their strength that many dismissed warnings that electric vehicles would soon challenge the internal combustion engine. After failing to invest in batteries and other technology for new-generation cars, many now find themselves overtaken by Chinese upstarts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent study by PwC found that German auto suppliers, partly through reluctance to change, have suffered a loss of global market share since 2019 as big as their gains in the previous two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More German businesses are complaining of the growing density of red tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BioNTech, a lauded biotech firm that developed the Covid-19 vaccine produced in partnership with Pfizer, recently decided to move some research and clinical-trial activities to the U.K. because of Germany’s restrictive rules on data protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German privacy laws made it impossible to run key studies for cancer cures, BioNTech’s co-founder Ugur Sahin said recently. German approvals processes for new treatments, which were accelerated during the pandemic, have reverted to their sluggish pace, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany ought to be among the nations winning from advances in medical science, said Hans Georg Näder, chairman of Ottobock, a leading maker of high-tech artificial limbs. Instead, operating in Germany is getting evermore difficult thanks to new regulations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One recent law required all German manufacturers to vouch for the environment, legal and ethical credentials of every component’s supplier, requiring even smaller companies to perform due diligence on many foreign firms, often based overseas, such as in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Näder said his company must now scrutinize thousands of business partners, from software developers to makers of tiny metal screws, to comply with regulation. Ottobock decided to open its latest factory in Bulgaria instead of Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy costs are posing an existential challenge to sectors such as chemicals. Russia’s war on Ukraine has exposed Germany’s costly bet on Russian gas to help fill a gap left by the decision to shut down nuclear power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German politicians dismissed warnings that Russian President Vladimir Putin used gas for geopolitical leverage, saying Moscow had always been a reliable supplier. After Putin invaded Ukraine, he throttled gas deliveries to Germany in an attempt to deter European support for Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy prices in Europe have declined from last year’s peak as EU countries scrambled to replace Russian gas, but German industry still faces higher costs than competitors in the U.S. and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German executives’ other complaints include a lack of skilled workers, complex immigration rules that make it hard to bring qualified workers from abroad and spotty telecommunications and digital infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our home market fills us with more and more concern,” Martin Brudermüller, chief executive of chemicals giant BASF, said at his annual shareholders’ meeting in April. “Profitability is no longer anywhere near where it should be,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem Germany can’t fix quickly is demographics. A shrinking labor force has left an estimated two million jobs unfilled. Some 43% of German businesses are struggling to find workers, with the average time for hiring someone approaching six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s fragmented political landscape makes it harder to enact far-reaching changes like the country did 20 years ago. In common with much of Europe, established center-right and center-left parties have lost their electoral dominance. The number of parties in Germany’s parliament has risen steadily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his Social Democrats lead an unwieldy governing coalition whose members often have diametrically opposed views on the way forward. The Free Democrats want to cut taxes, while the Greens would like to raise them. Left-leaning ministers want to greatly raise public investment spending, financed by borrowing if needed, but finance chief Lindner rejects that. “We need fiscal prudence,” Lindner said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior government members accept the need to cut red tape, as well as for an overhaul of Germany’s energy supply and infrastructure. But party differences often hold up even modest changes. This month the Greens lifted a veto of Lindner’s proposal to reduce business taxes only after they extracted consent for more welfare spending. As part of the deal, the government agreed to pass another law drafted by one of Lindner’s allies, Justice Minister Marco Buschmann, to trim regulation for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholz recently rejected gloomy predictions about Germany. Changes are needed but not a fundamental overhaul of the export-led model that has served Germany well throughout the post-World War II era, he said in an interview on national TV recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He cited the inflow of foreign investment into the microchips sector by companies such as Intel, helped by generous government subsidies. Scholz said planned changes to immigration rules, including making it easier to qualify for German citizenship, would help attract more skilled workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Scholz has struggled to stop the infighting in his coalition. The government’s approval ratings have tanked, and the far-right populist Alternative for Germany party has overtaken Scholz’s Social Democrats in opinion polls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The country is being led by a bunch of Keystone Kops, a motley coalition that can’t get its act together,” Joffe said.&lt;/p&gt;

381,stocks,"China Evergrande Group lost $2.2 billion, or 79% of its market value, on Monday after its shares resumed trading in a crucial step for the world's most indebted property firm to restructure its offshore debt.

Evergrande is at the centre of a crisis in China's property sector that has seen a string of debt defaults since late 2021, and its stock has been suspended for 17 months.

The developer, which is in the process of getting approvals from creditors and the courts to implement the debt restructuring plan, said on Monday it would postpone by a month meetings for these creditors to vote on the proposal to give more time ""to maximise creditor engagement and support informed-decision making"".

The scheme meetings will now take place on Sept 26, instead of Monday, but three people with direct knowledge of the matter said many creditors had already registered their vote by a deadline last Wednesday to submit forms.

Evergrande needs approval from more than 75% of the holders of each debt class to approve the plan, which offers creditors with a basket of options to swap debt for new bonds and equity-linked instruments backed by its stocks and those of its Hong Kong-listed units.

Its Hong Kong listed shares closed down 79% to HK$0.35 on Monday. Market capitalisation shrank to HK$4.6 billion ($586.29 million) from HK$21.8 billion ($2.78 billion) from when it last traded.

383,stocks,"Electric vehicle maker BYD Co Ltd said on Monday its unit struck a deal with U.S.-based manufacturing firm Jabil Inc's Singaporean division to buy its mobility business in China for 15.8 billion yuan ($2.17 billion).

The deal will expand BYD Electronic (International) Co's (BE) customer base, product portfolio, and its business of smartphone components, and boost its growth as it looks to capture the potential growth in the sector.

Jabil Circuit (Singapore), which manufactures printed circuit boards, established a unit this month with product manufacturing business in Chengdu and Wuxi, which will now be sold to the Chinese EV maker.

""While improving BE's market share of products, the acquisition will effectively synergize with BE's existing products, enhance the overall competitiveness, ensure long-term sustainable development,"" BYD said in an exchange filing, without divulging any further details about the acquisition

Additionally, if you're in the camp of ""Only buy US stocks"" don't feel like you need to read the following heresy. At the bottom of this comment I give definitions of the various UK / European indices of relevance. 

First, as I [have written here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/10izb7y/an_update_to_eurous_macro_situation_ft_eurozone/), the macro situation in the UK has been a major disappointment compared to its G7 colleagues. [I put together this album in January](https://imgur.com/a/0KiUXQC) (12 graphs) making this case. Thus, it isn't unexpected that its stock market naturally trails the US/Europe. Up to a point.

The FT had a [recent article](https://www.ft.com/content/726a6188-f04c-40e4-b7d1-a055d75e772c) about the UK's stock market. Some of the graphs and statistics are striking.

- Graph 1: [A decade of sadness for the FTSE 100 versus the S&amp;P 500](https://i.imgur.com/8O6C8ea.png).
- Graph 2: If not bad enough, [here are UK indices versus the rest of the world](https://i.imgur.com/hX4LgRV.png). 

The resulting valuation gap is remarkable:

&gt;  On one crude indicator, price/earnings, FTSE 350 stocks were virtually equally valued to global shares on the eve of the referendum, with both at 18.6 according to Bloomberg data. Now they’re about half the price: as of last Thursday, the FTSE 350 had a price/earnings ratio of 10, while MSCI’s World Index stood at 19.8.

- Graph 3: [PE Ratios for the FTSE 350 vs. Europe (w/ UK included) and the S&amp;P 500.](https://i.imgur.com/NSBxMpE.png).

How extreme are these P/E ratios? According to [Yardeni Research](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/mscipe.pdf), here are some forward P/Es for other countries/region as of last week:

- Japan: 14.3
- US: 19.1
- European Monetary Union (EMU): 11.9 (so countries in the euro-zone, no UK)
- Emerging Markets: 11.9
- World: 16.0
- ACW ex-US 12.6
- Germany: 10.6
- France: 12.9
- Spain: 9.9

And the UK: 10.2.

Maybe Germany/France are also too cheap here. But I'll focus on the UK. Right now emerging markets are more expensive on a forward P/E ratio than the UK. It doesn't add up. Perhaps you think the UK's governance is a disaster. Then sure, avoid domestic UK companies (FTSE 250/FTSE 350). But the FTSE 100 is largely multinationals who derive most of their revenue abroad. Should it really be getting a 10 P/E ratio? In theory, the UK has a ton of advantages: strong property rights, world class universities, and life science research, and some of the oldest financial institutions. Brexit was a self-inflicted wound but there are emerging market countries with much worse governance equipped with richer valuations.

387,stocks,"China lowered the stamp duty on stock trades for the first time since 2008 and pledged to slow the pace of initial public offerings, among a slew of new measures to woo investors back to its flagging equities market.

The levy charged on stock trades will drop from 0.1% to 0.05% as of Aug. 28, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement Sunday, in a move to “invigorate capital markets and boost investor confidence.”

The China Securities Regulatory Commission cited “recent market conditions” as its rationale for slowing the pace of IPOs, without giving details on how it would do so. The CSRC also said restrictions will be set on the frequency and size of refinancing for companies which continuously report financial losses and whose stock prices have fallen below IPO levels or net asset levels. Property developers are exempted from the rule, it said.

Authorities have been trying to dispel worries about the economy triggered by a slumping property market, trust defaults and weak consumer spending. Foreign investors sold mainland China stocks on a net basis for 13 consecutive sessions through Wednesday, the longest stretch ever, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

“Stamp duty cut alone won’t make a difference to the Chinese stocks,” said Neo Wang, Evercore ISI’s New York-based managing director for China Research. “We expect a rally this week, maybe to a less degree than those after China lowered stamp duty in 2008.”

China last cut the stamp duty in April 2008, reducing it to 0.1% to support the market after a plunge, spurring a bull run the following year. The year prior, in May 2007, it raised the rate to 0.3% to cool a rally that was drawing more than 300,000 new investors a day.

Wang added that a turnaround in the A-share market would not happen unless Beijing adopts more “bazooka” measures, such as the 4 trillion yuan stimulus package it rolled out in 2008.

The CSI 300 Index has declined about 4% in 2023 after back-to-back annual losses and is underperforming a broader gauge of Asian equities by about six percentage points. Authorities this month urged pension funds, large banks and other big domestic financial institutions to increase stock investments to support the market.

Regulators have also cut handling fees on stock transactions, prodded mutual fund managers to increase purchases of their own equity funds and encouraged companies to do more share buybacks.

Other highlights of the measures announced by CSRC on Sunday:

    Margin ratio for margin trading is lowered to 80% from 100%, effective from market closing on Sept. 8
        Adjustment will apply to both new and existing contracts of margin trading
    For companies with stock prices fallen below IPO levels or net asset levels, or which haven’t paid cash dividends or which are paying a total cash dividend lower than 30% of average net profit of the recent three years, the controlling share holders and de facto controlling holders will not be allowed to cut holdings in the secondary market

SNAP didn't really have a good way to put ads. They made deals with some companies so they could put ads.

390,stocks,"Live adaptation of One Piece is coming to Netflix on August 31st. For those who don't know, One Piece is the best-selling Japanese manga (comics) series. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, where he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as the ""One Piece"" in order to become the next King of the Pirates. Here's why I think it will *probably* be a big deal:

* One Piece is the second most sold comic book in the world. The first one is Superman with roughly 600m copies sold, One Piece is second with 516.5m, Batman is third with 484m. Also, to give some perspective, One Piece is being sold in copies of \~200 pages, that's 5 to 10 times the size of Batman or Superman comics, and unlike those two it was going for only \~25 years, not 100+ years. So realistically it's already far far ahead of everything else.
* To add some numbers, One Piece has 1000+ manga chapters, 1000+ anime episodes, 15+ movies, 40+ video games and a Disneyland-like theme park.
* This time Netflix won't repeat the Witcher's mistake. The showrunners has shown great respect to the source material. Everyone from the cast are big fans of the manga. One Piece's author has spent a lot of time on overseeing the production.
* The rumors say that Netflix went big here and spent \~$18m on each episode of the adaptation. In comparison, the cost of Game of Thrones season 1 was around $5-6m per episode.
* There are some early reviews already. Everyone is overwhelmingly positive and claims it's the best live adaptation of anime/manga ever. To be fair, I'd be still cautious here since the bar is rather low - all previous adaptations were rather bad, so there is still no guarantee that the series will be on par with regular, non adaptation series.
* Back to #1, One Piece is more popular than Batman, and yet it's less known. Probably every person in the world knows Batman. And most likely every second person reading this post has never heard about One Piece. That's what the live series might change, it will open an already winning IP to an even wider audience.

It seems that the setup is great for the show's success. So, in my opinion, there is a fair chance that Netflix will push One Piece to eventually overstep IPs like Harry Potter/Batman/etc. What do you think, how can Netflix's stock price react to that potential? I feel that due to this weird nature of One Piece being the most popular but yet fairly unknown series, it's completely overlooked and not priced in. So if it turns out to be good, it should result in good SP bump, but I'd be happy to hear your thoughts and opinions about that","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live adaptation of One Piece is coming to Netflix on August 31st. For those who don&amp;#39;t know, One Piece is the best-selling Japanese manga (comics) series. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, where he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as the &amp;quot;One Piece&amp;quot; in order to become the next King of the Pirates. Here&amp;#39;s why I think it will &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; be a big deal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One Piece is the second most sold comic book in the world. The first one is Superman with roughly 600m copies sold, One Piece is second with 516.5m, Batman is third with 484m. Also, to give some perspective, One Piece is being sold in copies of ~200 pages, that&amp;#39;s 5 to 10 times the size of Batman or Superman comics, and unlike those two it was going for only ~25 years, not 100+ years. So realistically it&amp;#39;s already far far ahead of everything else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To add some numbers, One Piece has 1000+ manga chapters, 1000+ anime episodes, 15+ movies, 40+ video games and a Disneyland-like theme park.&lt;/li&gt;

394,stocks,"DIS has made the decision to further up its streaming monetization efforts by adopting paid sharing starting in 2024, following NFLX's lead. These price increases come on top of those for Hulu and Disney+ Premium (ad-free) that will increase by 20% and 30%, respectively, starting in October 2023. While these initiatives may accelerate the company's top and bottom-line growth, it is still unclear whether they will be able to increase Disney+'s dwindling US streaming market share to 13% by Q2 of 23.   
Long-term, the well-diversified entertainment options provided by DIS, including ESPN and sports betting, across resorts, theme parks, cruises, and streaming, might be a real franchise flywheel. Able to set itself apart from rivals and preserve an alluring value proposition for clients. Disney and Apple have a number of intriguing partnerships for the Vision Pro spatial headset, which will feature Disney+ streaming video and immersive 4D gaming experiences. Although the headset won't be available until early 2024, the media company will probably benefit from its strong IP portfolio and increasingly varied revenue prospects.   
Netflix, unlike Disney, has not yet increased pricing, but it has also subtly discontinued the cheapest ad-free package, thereby increasing overall subscription and advertisement profits. Since more customers are likely to switch to ad-supported rates as a result of less discretionary spending, an elevated interest rate environment, and increased ad-free streaming plans, these moves are undoubtedly deliberate.  
However, Disney investors should also be aware of Disney+'s diminishing streaming market share in the US, which will drop to 13% by Q2 23 (a 5% decrease from December 2022 and a 2% YoY increase). The increased prices could likely result in more churn and market share losses, increasing the stock's volatility during the ensuing two quarters.

It's common to see people say the S&amp;P 500 returns 8% or 10% or X% annually. In many conversations it's meant to be a rough estimate, which is fine, but many newer investors just pencil it in. 
 
The problem is there are multiple ways to calculate an average.
 
The numbers thrown around when calculating the average return of the index are often the *simple average*. This is the wrong average for investing. 
 
A simple annual average takes all the returns for each year in a period and divides by the number of years in the period. But this is meaningless. 
 
If you bought a stock that returned 100% in the first year and then lost 50% in the second year, then your simple average return in two years is 25%. In reality, you're return is 0% (it doubled, then halved, and now you're back where you started). It's easy to see this with such a ""simple"" example, but the same is true over longer periods of time with less perfect numbers. 
 
For investors, the *geometric average* is what's important. This is what compound annual growth rates (CAGR) reflect. 
 
For example, in the last 25 years (1998 to 2022) the S&amp;P 500 has a simple average annual return of 9.2% and a geometric average annual return of 6.9%. That's a meaningful difference when planning for retirement many years away.
 
And if you account for inflation, then the real geometric average annual return is ""only"" 3.8% in that span (still likely your best option among investments).

Personally, I’m intrigued based on the limited on-the-ground information I have. They’re *the* go-to for grocery delivery I’ve noticed. At least in my circle-lots of younger folks, especially higher income young professionals, use it very frequently. Their valuation is a lot lower from what they planned during the pandemic if I remember right, but I think especially in ever-popular urban areas, they’ve got a lock on the market. Moreover, as younger folks move out to the suburbs to get cheaper housing, they’ll likely remain loyal. It’s well priced as a service and people like it-and the grocers themselves seem to love it.

Is there something I’m missing here? The most obvious threat I can think of is Uber’s continued horizontal integration across the delivery space; what is Instacart’s moat against that?

2. Trillions of dollars in CRE loans come due in the next 2 years, likely severely imperiling most banks outside of the nation’s largest ones

3. Trillions of high-yield debt becoming increasingly hard to finance, which could lead to a large rise in bankruptcies dragged out over years

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

UBER vs LYFT. I own both but kind of wishing I didn't. They've both been discussed a lot here and on other subs and I think a lot of the sentiment surrounding Lyft has to do with their own personal experience with Lyft and how it's either been slower or more expensive, etc. You obviously can't understate the importance that food delivery has had with Uber and that's something that Lyft didn't capitalize on. But still- I'm up +123% on Uber and down -24% on Lyft. Considering they essentially have the same business model, that's pretty insane. And considering how well Uber is doing, if Lyft can't do well now- can they ever? Should I just be hoping they get acquired?

Speaking of acquisition bait- I foolishly bought Bird (BRDS) a year ago and it's since down a whopping -91%. It's obviously not coming back up and they could get acquired but idk if it's worth holding out for. As much as I believe in scooters as a first/last mile option, it seems like between the local governments not supporting parking programs and people refusing to share space on the sidewalk- the shine has worn off and the startups have fizzled out. Again, if they can't do well now when everyone else is doing well- is it time to cut my losses?

Beyond Meat (BYND) is another one where I'm down -22% and just hoping that someone picks them up and bails me out. I still eat their products but I'm ready to admit that the stock isn't going anywhere.

Last one- CVS. Down -15% after trying to only buy at what I thought was going to be the all-time low (lol). What is happening? It's crazy to me. It's the one stock that I genuinely don't understand. I don't even know where to start or how to end.

Rocket Lab successfully reflew an engine on an Electron launch Aug. 23 as the company moves a step closer to reusing the entire rocket booster.

The Electron rocket lifted off from the company’s Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 7:45 p.m. Eastern. The “We Love the Nightlife” mission deployed a Capella Space radar imaging satellite into a 640-kilometer mid-inclination orbit 58 minutes after liftoff.

The launch was originally scheduled for July 30 but scrubbed because of data from a sensor in one engine that indicated low igniter pressure. A second attempt on Aug. 6 was also scrubbed.

Rocket Lab decided to replace the entire booster with one that the company had just completed. The new booster, unlike the original one, was designed for recovery.

“The call was made to bring forward that recovery booster and swap the payload onto this Electron to tighten the turnaround to get back to the pad for Capella and accelerate our efforts to make Electron a reusable rocket at the exact same time,” Rocket Lab spokesperson Murielle Baker said during the launch webcast.

The booster not only was designed for reuse but also, among its nine Rutherford engines, was one that had flown on an Electron launch in May 2022. The engine had gone through what Rocket Lab described as multiple full-duration hotfire tests to confirm it could be flown again.

“The data is in, perfect performance from the reused engine and the stage,” Peter Beck, Rocket Lab chief executive, tweeted after the launch.

During an Aug. 8 earnings call, Beck suggested that reflying a Rutherford engine, then scheduled for some time before the end of the year, was one of the final steps before the company is ready to reuse an entire booster.

“From there we’ll schedule the first reflight of a full stage booster,” he said in the call, but did not offer a timeline for doing so beyond noting that additional improvements to support reusability were planned for the 45th flight of the vehicle.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-reuses-engine-on-electron-launch/""&gt;https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-reuses-engine-on-electron-launch/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I just want to first cover some of the popular rationale for a liquidity discount. Usually the major point is of course in the name, liquidity, being that for many micro caps and small caps, in order to exit your position, you are likely to have to exit a large position at what was previously less than market price or you’re an investor that due to circumstance (say a mutual fund), values liquidity and the ability to sell out of a position in a day without losing a significant amount of value. 

The other main point I’ve seen is really just the positive correlation between illiquidity and volatility of stock price which kind of relates to the previous point but is different. 

The context for me is my investment in Nathan’s Famous (NATH) who has a great business model built by a moat on protecting and expanding their IP while monetizing it through licensing, food distribution, franchising, and company-operated restaurants.

&amp;#x200B;

Peloton on Wednesday reported a wider-than-expected loss and a quarterly drop in new subscribers that it blamed on its recall of its Bike seat post and seasonality, sending shares plunging about 20%.

The company fell short of analysts’ earnings estimates but beat sales expectations.

Here’s how the fitness company did in its fourth fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

Loss per share: 68 cents vs. 38 cents expected

Revenue: $642.1 million vs. $639.9 million expected

The company reported a net loss of $241.8 million, or 68 cents per share, for the three-month period that ended June 30, compared with a loss of $1.26 billion, or $3.72 a share, a year earlier.

Sales dropped to $642.1 million, down $678.7 million a year earlier.

The company’s fiscal fourth quarter, which falls during the summer months, is traditionally slow not just for Peloton but also for other fitness retailers. Consumers have a tendency to pull back on workouts during the season as they travel and take part in other summer plans.

In May, CEO Barry McCarthy warned the fourth quarter would be among its most challenging from a growth perspective. For the first time, Peloton projected a decline in subscribers.

It ended the quarter with 3.08 million subscribers, up 4% year over year and in line with the company’s expectations. But compared with last quarter, subscribers declined by 29,000. Peloton attributed the drop to a “seasonal” slowdown in hardware sales and higher-than-anticipated churn.

“Peloton’s FYQ4 performance is a reminder we operate a seasonal business,” McCarthy wrote in a letter to shareholders.

“The slowdown exceeded our expectations through May and through the first three weeks of June as consumer spending shifted toward travel and experiences,” he wrote. “Then eight weeks ago the trend reversed itself, and we began to see a reacceleration in hardware sales.”

Peloton also believes the recall of its Bike seat post, which had a tendency to detach and break unexpectedly during use, created more churn than it expected. The metric stood at 1.4% for the quarter. The company suspects 15,000 to 20,000 people decided to pause their monthly subscriptions during the quarter while they waited for their seat post to be replaced.

The recall, announced in May, impacted more than 2 million Bikes the company had sold since January 2018 and cost $40 million in the quarter, far more than Peloton expected, McCarthy said. To date, the company has received 750,000 requests for replacement seat posts, which is also more than it had anticipated. So far, Peloton has fulfilled 340,000 requests and expects to wrap up the rest by the end of September.

Peloton narrowly reached positive free cash flow status on an adjusted basis, but doesn’t expect that will last during the next two quarters due to expected slowdowns in hardware sales, timing of inventory payments, marketing spending and the cash needed for the seat posts. However, it does expect to reach free cash flow positivity in the second half of fiscal 2024.

In premarket trading, Peloton’s shares plunged about 30%, but they regained some ground after the market opened. McCarthy commented on the stock price during his call with analysts, saying there is “enormous disconnect between the stock price” and the work the company is doing to drive growth.

“I don’t mean to sound like one of those CEOs who’s completely disconnected from the stock price, because it’s not lost on me,” said McCarthy. “But I have never been more optimistic, more excited about the future of the business.”

Strategy changes on the path to growth McCarthy, a former Netflix and Spotify executive, has spent the last three months focusing on new strategies aimed at getting the fitness company back on a path to growth.

The company has been working to capture customers who don’t have thousands of dollars to splurge on a stationary bike or treadmill by offering a rental program and a certified refurbished option. The rental service, which recently launched in Germany, now has more than 48,000 subscribers. The refurbished line brought in 6,500 sales during the quarter.

Both are “proving to be important growth initiatives,” McCarthy told shareholders.

Part of that strategy is the company’s rebrand under the guidance of its new Chief Marketing Officer Leslie Berland, a former Twitter (now known as X) executive. The retailer has positioned itself as a fitness company for all that is just as invested in its app as it is its pricey connected fitness products, such as its Bike, Tread and Row.

In May, it unveiled a series of new pricing tiers for its fitness app that includes an unlimited free membership option (with no credit card required) and levels that cost $12.99 and $24 monthly. The app allows consumers to watch Peloton’s fitness classes and build their own workouts from wherever they are, including their gym.

Since the relaunch, the company has clocked more than 900,000 app downloads, over two-thirds of which were non-Peloton members. It is also seeing more purchases of its higher-priced membership tier than it expected. It ended the quarter with 256,000 free monthly active users.

“The anytime, anywhere, anyplace message is absolutely landing,” McCarthy said on a call with analysts.

“The last objective \[of the relaunch\] was to remind people that, and particularly with the launch of the app, that it’s more than just a stationary bike company and that message is also finding traction.”

Peloton is also seeing “meaningful positive shifts in perception across a range of measures” including gains among Gen Z consumers and others who may be older but still new to fitness. Peloton is also seeing a shift in the types of people who are downloading its app toward men, Gen Z, Black and Hispanic consumers.

As part of the rebrand, Peloton is beginning to offer a variety of “limited edition bike frame colors and graphics to both the consumer and commercial markets,” McCarthy said.

“For the last ten years Peloton has been the Henry Ford of stationary bikes. We sold any color bike frame you wanted as long as you wanted black,” he told shareholders. “I’m excited to announce a change in strategy. ... Expect to hear more about this exciting initiative this fall.”

Peloton has also been leaning into its business-to-business strategy to further drive revenue and capture new customers. Earlier this month, it announced the launch of Peloton for Business, which allows companies to offer access to the app and its connected fitness products through its benefits offerings.

Clients include Volvo, which has Peloton bikes in its company fitness center and offers employees access to the Peloton app, its all-access membership and discounts on hardware, including the Bike, Bike+, Tread and Guide. Dropbox offers a similar package to its employees.

Peloton also launched a new program aimed at partnering with NCAA Division 1 schools. The new strategy kicked off Tuesday with its announcement that it will be partnering with the University of Michigan to create co-branded Peloton bikes that will be used at the school’s various fitness facilities – and along the sidelines at the school’s football stadium, known as the Big House.

“Expect to hear more announcements about additional global partners in the weeks ahead,” McCarthy said.

It also launched a new discounted offering for college students of its “One” tier, which typically costs $12.99 a month but will be cut to $6.99 a month.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/23/peloton-pton-earnings-q4-2023.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/23/peloton-pton-earnings-q4-2023.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, it unveiled a series of new pricing tiers for its fitness app that includes an unlimited free membership option (with no credit card required) and levels that cost $12.99 and $24 monthly. The app allows consumers to watch Peloton’s fitness classes and build their own workouts from wherever they are, including their gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the relaunch, the company has clocked more than 900,000 app downloads, over two-thirds of which were non-Peloton members. It is also seeing more purchases of its higher-priced membership tier than it expected. It ended the quarter with 256,000 free monthly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The anytime, anywhere, anyplace message is absolutely landing,” McCarthy said on a call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The last objective [of the relaunch] was to remind people that, and particularly with the launch of the app, that it’s more than just a stationary bike company and that message is also finding traction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peloton is also seeing “meaningful positive shifts in perception across a range of measures” including gains among Gen Z consumers and others who may be older but still new to fitness. Peloton is also seeing a shift in the types of people who are downloading its app toward men, Gen Z, Black and Hispanic consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the rebrand, Peloton is beginning to offer a variety of “limited edition bike frame colors and graphics to both the consumer and commercial markets,” McCarthy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For the last ten years Peloton has been the Henry Ford of stationary bikes. We sold any color bike frame you wanted as long as you wanted black,” he told shareholders. “I’m excited to announce a change in strategy. ... Expect to hear more about this exciting initiative this fall.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peloton has also been leaning into its business-to-business strategy to further drive revenue and capture new customers. Earlier this month, it announced the launch of Peloton for Business, which allows companies to offer access to the app and its connected fitness products through its benefits offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clients include Volvo, which has Peloton bikes in its company fitness center and offers employees access to the Peloton app, its all-access membership and discounts on hardware, including the Bike, Bike+, Tread and Guide. Dropbox offers a similar package to its employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peloton also launched a new program aimed at partnering with NCAA Division 1 schools. The new strategy kicked off Tuesday with its announcement that it will be partnering with the University of Michigan to create co-branded Peloton bikes that will be used at the school’s various fitness facilities – and along the sidelines at the school’s football stadium, known as the Big House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Expect to hear more announcements about additional global partners in the weeks ahead,” McCarthy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also launched a new discounted offering for college students of its “One” tier, which typically costs $12.99 a month but will be cut to $6.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

I will highlight some notable quotes from the recent interview with former St. Louis Fed James Bullard. He resigned on Aug 14, 2023. Although he was known as one of the most hawkish Fed member, he was also correct over the last 2 years in expecting inflation to be sticky, and expecting the Fed to hike way more than what anyone ever anticipated. He is also one of the most bullish, arguing that the economy is more resilient than people think. He is also in the camp of shorter lag for rate hike, arguing that most of the rate hike effect have already passed through to the real economy (you can observe that when he said the easing of financial condition after SVB is feeding into a stronger 2H 2023).

&amp;#x200B;

There's an interesting statement where he said there're a lot of recession scenarios in the June 2023 FOMC dot plot (not the Fed staff forecast made by economists at the Fed, but the actual dot plot by FOMC members. In June and July, Powell said he disagreed with the Fed staff recession forecast, and the Fed revised up full year 2023 real GDP growth from 0.4% to 1%). No current Fed officials will ever admit they have a recession in their forecast. Only former Fed officials like Richard Clarida and James Bullard can talk openly about these things. To get around using the word ""recession"", Fed officials might use words like ""softish"" or ""bumpy"" landing, which are equivalent to a mild recession. I've even seen big banks like Morgan Stanley consider a mild recession as ""soft landing"", and they were the early soft landing forecasters, along with Goldman Sachs.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Bullard**: I think it’s turning out that the **Fed’s policy has been very successful**, and I think that will be the **buzz at Jackson Hole**. I don’t know what will be in the speeches, but the **talk will be that this has been quite successful**.

&amp;#x200B;

There were a lot of **heavy predictions of recession**. I think those were just **overblown**.

Because of the SVB situation, **rates actually went down in the spring**. And there’s been an unwitting **easing of financial conditions**, which is feeding into a **stronger second half for the U.S. economy**. And now everyone’s scrambling to **reprice based on that stronger economy.**

&amp;#x200B;

The f**aster growth is a bit of a threat** because the **forecast was that you’d have very weak growth or even a recession**, and now that **doesn’t really look like** it is **materializing**. So you’d have to **upgrade your outlook for inflation** probably based on that alone. You still have a **very tight labor market**, and now you have a **reacceleration in the U.S. economy**. The **risks are tilting** a little bit more toward the idea that **inflation won’t fall as fast as anticipated.**

&amp;#x200B;

Bullard: I’m **skeptical that we’re returning** to that **\[pre-pandemic environment of low interest rate and low inflation**\]. You’ve got **inflation above \[the Fed’s 2%\] target**, and it’s probably **going to be relatively sticky above target.** Roughly speaking, the **policy rate** would **have to be higher than** the **inflation rate during that whole period when inflation is above target**. That sounds like a **higher interest-rate regime** than the **one that has existed since 2008.**

&amp;#x200B;

And in the **’70s, you had similar shocks and the Fed didn’t react enough or fast enough.** They **stopped up short**, and you got a **decade of high and variable inflation**. This time **we reacted more appropriately** and more effectively, and now we’re **getting the fruits of that** by **getting inflation down.**

&amp;#x200B;

Bullard: The \[Fed’s rate-setting\] **committee will have to re-evaluate its forecast in September** for the summary of economic projections. And those **projections in June still had a big element of a recessionary scenario**—which at least, as of today, looks like it’s **blown out of the water**. That suggests that the **committee would keep its rate increase in there for sometime this fall**. It seems like you’d **probably follow through on the rate increase** that was **penciled in in June.**

The bigger question for markets, though, is **whether the economy really does accelerate quite a bit in the second half of 2023** and the **committee feels compelled** to, let’s say, **go above 6% on the policy rate**—possibly because some of the **inflation readings turn around and blip up** or maybe have a little bit of a **sustained increase.**

**I don’t think markets** are really **ready for that. But that’s an increasing risk** now.

* The new contract includes pay raises for both part-time and full-time workers.
* It also includes other improvements to work rules including an end to forced overtime.
* Workers began voting on the new contract on August 2.

American Airlines also approved 46% increase in compensation and the UAW is also demanding 46% increase in compensation, voting on August 22nd whether or not to authorize a strike.

UPS workers ratified a massive five-year labor deal that includes big wage increases and other improvements to work rules and schedules, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said Tuesday.

The deal passed with 86.3% of votes, the highest contract vote in the history of Teamsters at UPS, according to the union.

“Teamsters have set a new standard and raised the bar for pay, benefits, and working conditions in the package delivery industry. This is the template for how workers should be paid and protected nationwide, and nonunion companies like Amazon better pay attention,” Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien said in a statement.

UPS and the Teamsters union, which represents about 340,000 workers at the delivery giant, reached a preliminary deal last month, narrowly averting a strike that could have rippled throughout the U.S. economy as the previous contract expiration on July 31 approached.

UPS moves $3.8 billion worth of goods a day, about 5% of the country’s gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The parties had until July 31, when the previous labor contract was set to expire, to reach a deal and avoid a work stoppage. Workers began voting on the new contract on August 2. It’s the single largest collective bargaining agreement ever reached in the private sector, according to the union.

Part-time workers will make no less than $21 an hour, up from a minimum of $15.50 currently, according to the union. Part-time pay was a sticking point during labor negotiations. Full-time workers will average $49 an hour. Current workers will get $2.75 more an hour this year and $7.50 an hour more during the five-year contract.

UPS drivers will average $170,000 in pay and benefits at the end of the five-year deal, CEO Carol Tomé said on an earnings call earlier this month.

The company cut its full-year revenue and margin forecasts, citing the “volume impact from labor negotiations and the costs associated with the tentative agreement.”

The union is the latest labor organization to push a major U.S. company for better pay, schedules and other work rules in the wake of the pandemic and decades-high inflation.

On Monday, American Airlines
pilots ratified a four-year deal that includes roughly 46% increases in compensation, including 401(k) contributions, a deal the carrier sweetened after rival United Airlines reached a richer agreement with its pilots’ union. Delta Air Lines

# [Stock futures are higher after Nasdaq’s best day in August: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/21/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-the-nasdaq-rises-to-its-best-day-in-august-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street tried to build momentum following positive sessions for the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 109 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures both added about 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite posted its biggest advance of the month during Monday’s main trading session, rising 1.6%. The S&amp;P 500 added close to 0.7%. The two benchmarks snapped a four-day slide, and the Nasdaq notched its biggest one-day advance since August. The Dow ticked down 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Notably, the broad market index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were able to post gains even as the yield on the 10-year Treasury reached its highest level since November 2007, gaining about 9 basis points to trade at 4.34%. Tech shares historically struggle in a high-rate environment, making the tandem rise with yields on Monday more striking for Wall Street.
*****
&gt; “We’re seeing a positive return in the stock market, [which] we didn’t see last week. We think rates are going to be higher for longer and maybe the stock market’s okay with it,” Katy Kaminski, chief market strategist at AlphaSimplex, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; To be sure, some on Wall Street are not confident the rally can continue for much longer.
*****
&gt; “Typically, spikes in Treasury yields expose other areas of weakness. The rise in yields will make debt refinancing even more burdensome. … Another reason yields are rising is that investors are beginning to get realistic on the Fed’s path (more rate hikes may come),” said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.
*****
&gt; “This is a risk to tech stocks and growth stocks with high PE multiples. Therefore, we expect additional downside in the equity market is likely,” Horneman continued.
*****
&gt; Consumer retail giants Lowe’s and Macy’s reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday before the bell. Lowe’s gained 2.5% premarket after posting mixed results but reaffirming its full-year guidance, while Macy’s stock price edged lower on a cautious forecast for the full year.
*****
&gt; Investors are keeping a close eye on Nvidia’s earnings due Wednesday. Its shares rose more than 8% Monday, making it one of the largest tech gainers. The company is largely seen as a bellwether on the AI-boom and sentiment.
*****
&gt; On the economic data front, Wall Street will be looking toward the Philadelphia Fed’s nonmanufacturing survey, as well as the Richmond Fed’s manufacturing survey results. Existing home sales data for July is also scheduled for release Tuesday morning.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s remarks at Jackson Hole on Friday for more insight on the central bank’s inflation outlook.

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, August 22nd, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Tuesday, August the 22nd, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/21/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-the-nasdaq-rises-to-its-best-day-in-august-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures are higher after Nasdaq’s best day in August: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street tried to build momentum following positive sessions for the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;amp;P 500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 109 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures both added about 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq Composite posted its biggest advance of the month during Monday’s main trading session, rising 1.6%. The S&amp;amp;P 500 added close to 0.7%. The two benchmarks snapped a four-day slide, and the Nasdaq notched its biggest one-day advance since August. The Dow ticked down 0.1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the broad market index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were able to post gains even as the yield on the 10-year Treasury reached its highest level since November 2007, gaining about 9 basis points to trade at 4.34%. Tech shares historically struggle in a high-rate environment, making the tandem rise with yields on Monday more striking for Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing a positive return in the stock market, [which] we didn’t see last week. We think rates are going to be higher for longer and maybe the stock market’s okay with it,” Katy Kaminski, chief market strategist at AlphaSimplex, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, some on Wall Street are not confident the rally can continue for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Typically, spikes in Treasury yields expose other areas of weakness. The rise in yields will make debt refinancing even more burdensome. … Another reason yields are rising is that investors are beginning to get realistic on the Fed’s path (more rate hikes may come),” said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a risk to tech stocks and growth stocks with high PE multiples. Therefore, we expect additional downside in the equity market is likely,” Horneman continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer retail giants Lowe’s and Macy’s reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday before the bell. Lowe’s gained 2.5% premarket after posting mixed results but reaffirming its full-year guidance, while Macy’s stock price edged lower on a cautious forecast for the full year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are keeping a close eye on Nvidia’s earnings due Wednesday. Its shares rose more than 8% Monday, making it one of the largest tech gainers. The company is largely seen as a bellwether on the AI-boom and sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the economic data front, Wall Street will be looking toward the Philadelphia Fed’s nonmanufacturing survey, as well as the Richmond Fed’s manufacturing survey results. Existing home sales data for July is also scheduled for release Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders are also anticipating Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s remarks at Jackson Hole on Friday for more insight on the central bank’s inflation outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

466,stocks,"In the world of finance, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed how trading is conducted. One prominent AI model that has garnered attention is ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI. While AI has shown remarkable capabilities, especially in natural language processing, it is essential to explore whether human stock traders still possess a distinct edge. In this article, we delve into the nuances of stock trading, highlighting the unique qualities that make human traders superior to ChatGPT.


**Intuition and Emotional Intelligence**
Human stock traders possess an innate ability to leverage intuition and emotional intelligence when making investment decisions. They can factor in market sentiment, news events, and global trends that might not be fully captured by AI models like ChatGPT. For instance, during times of economic uncertainty, human traders can intuitively navigate market volatility, adjusting their strategies based on a nuanced understanding of the prevailing emotions. This aspect of human trading can significantly impact decision-making and yield successful outcomes.

**Adaptability to Market Dynamics**
Markets are inherently complex and dynamic, influenced by various factors such as geopolitical events, economic indicators, and unexpected news. Human traders are better equipped to adapt to these changing dynamics, as they can quickly process and interpret new information. Unlike ChatGPT, which relies on pre-existing data and patterns, human traders can apply their knowledge and adapt their strategies in real time to capitalize on emerging opportunities or mitigate risks.

**Contextual Understanding**
Stock trading involves more than just numbers and patterns. It requires a deep understanding of the broader economic and business landscape. Human traders possess the ability to discern contextual cues that might not be evident in datasets used by AI models. This understanding allows them to anticipate market shifts and make informed decisions based on their comprehensive grasp of market dynamics.

**Complex Decision-Making**
The decisions made by human traders often involve multifaceted considerations that go beyond quantitative analysis. Factors like company leadership, industry trends, and long-term growth potential play a vital role in investment choices. Human traders can synthesize various pieces of information, apply critical thinking, and make judgments that are not solely reliant on historical data – a level of complexity that AI models like ChatGPT might struggle to replicate.

**Unpredictability and Black Swan Events**
Financial markets are susceptible to black swan events – rare, unexpected occurrences that can have a profound impact on global economies and markets. The COVID-19 pandemic serves as a recent example of such an event. Human traders have the cognitive flexibility to respond to unprecedented situations and adjust their strategies accordingly. Their ability to think beyond conventional patterns is crucial when faced with these unforeseen challenges.

**Ethical Considerations and Accountability**
While AI models like ChatGPT lack moral agency, human traders are accountable for their decisions. They are bound by ethical considerations and the consequences of their actions. This accountability fosters responsible decision-making and prevents the implementation of strategies that might yield short-term gains at the expense of long-term stability – a restraint that AI models might not inherently possess.

**Subjective Evaluation of Data**
Human traders have the capacity to evaluate data subjectively, considering qualitative factors that might not be directly quantifiable. This allows them to develop a more holistic view of a company's potential and make investment choices that align with their convictions. For instance, they can assess corporate culture, values, and future prospects through a lens that AI models might struggle to replicate due to the inherent subjectivity involved.

While AI models like ChatGPT have showcased remarkable capabilities in various fields, the realm of stock trading remains an area where human traders maintain a distinct edge. The ability to leverage intuition, adapt to dynamic market conditions, understand context, make complex decisions, and respond to unpredictable events sets human traders apart. Furthermore, the ethical considerations, accountability, and the capacity for subjective evaluation of data make human traders an indispensable presence in the financial world.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Evidently they have a lot of orders currently with big deposits, along with a backlog of 1,900,000 orders waiting to be filled with a late 2023 or early 2024 release date.  
According to this article, that is a five-year backlog.  

“Tesla Cybertruck Orders Surpass 1.9 Million, 5 Year Wait Times” 

There are now over 1.9 million orders for the long-awaited Tesla Cybertruck, per a crowd-sourced data tracker. Speaking on an Earnings Call earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that demand for the Cybertruck is ""so off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.”

Given that Tesla plans to produce 375,000 Cybertrucks a year at peak capacity, new orders will technically take around 5 years to arrive. 

It seems to me that Tesla would be a great place to jump in if it falls to $200 per share.  I don’t see it going much lower than $200.00 

Recent history:
52 week history $101.81 low and $313.00 high.

But I am intrigued about what I’m hearing regarding the release of the cyber truck. Evidently they have a lot of orders currently with big deposits, along with a backlog of 1,900,000 orders waiting to be filled with a late 2023 or early 2024 release date.&lt;br/&gt;
According to this article, that is a five-year backlog.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tesla Cybertruck Orders Surpass 1.9 Million, 5 Year Wait Times” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are now over 1.9 million orders for the long-awaited Tesla Cybertruck, per a crowd-sourced data tracker. Speaking on an Earnings Call earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that demand for the Cybertruck is &amp;quot;so off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Tesla plans to produce 375,000 Cybertrucks a year at peak capacity, new orders will technically take around 5 years to arrive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that Tesla would be a great place to jump in if it falls to $200 per share.  I don’t see it going much lower than $200.00 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent history:

475,stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- An exchange-traded fund that aimed to track CNBC anchor Jim Cramer’s stock picks is planning to shutter just five months after launching.

The Long Cramer Tracker ETF (ticker LJIM) will stop trading Sept. 11, according to a press release Monday. The fund, which buys stocks recommended by the host of CNBC’s Mad Money show, has only managed to attract $1.3 million in assets amid gains of just 2.2% since its debut in March.

Tuttle Capital Management chief executive Matt Tuttle launched LJIM alongside the $3.4 million Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF (SJIM), which bets against Cramer’s stock calls and will continue to trade. While LJIM has actually outperformed its bearish Cramer counterpart, Tuttle says he is shutting the fund after failing to attract the attention of the CNBC host. 

“We started LJIM in order to facilitate a conversation with Jim Cramer around his stock picks as the other side to the Short Cramer ETF,” Tuttle said in the press release. “Unfortunately, Mr. Cramer and CNBC have been unwilling to engage in dialogue and instead have chosen to ignore the funds, therefore there is no reason to keep the long side going. Going forward we will just focus on the short side.”

A CNBC spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Despite a slide in August, LJIM has gained about 2.2% on a total return basis since inception, with Nvidia Corp., Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Oracle Corp. among its biggest holdings. SJIM, which also short-sells Cramer’s picks in addition to buying companies he recommends against, has dropped 4.4% over that span. 

Tuttle told Bloomberg’s Trillions podcast in March that he and two colleagues monitor Cramer’s television appearances and social media accounts to put together the fund’s actively managed portfolios, which charge 1.2%. A CNBC spokesperson said at the time that Cramer encourages long-term investing through “a balanced portfolio that includes index funds and individual stocks.”

Tuttle is behind some of the $7.4 trillion ETF industry’s more infamous products. In addition to the Cramer funds, he’s also behind the $240 million AXS Short Innovation Daily ETF (SARK), which wagers against Cathie Wood’s flagship fund

----------------------------

According to the latest New York Federal Reserve employment survey released Monday, the average “reservation wage,” or the minimum acceptable salary offer to switch jobs, rose to $78,645 during the second quarter of 2023.

That’s an increase of about 8% from just a year ago and is the highest level ever in a data series that goes back to the beginning of 2014. Over the past three years, which entails the Covid era, the level has risen more than 22%.

The number is significant in that wages increasingly have been recognized as a driving force in inflation. While goods prices have abated since pushing overall inflation to its highest level in more than 40 years in mid-2022, other factors continue to keep it well above the Fed’s targeted rate of 2%.

The New York Fed data is consistent with an Atlanta Fed tracker, which shows wages overall rising at a 6% annual rate but job switchers seeing 7% gains.

Employers have been trying to keep pace with the wage demands, pushing the average full-time offer up to $69,475, a 14% surge in the past year. The actual expected annual salary rose to $67,416, a gain of more than $7,000 from a year ago and also a new high.

Though there was a gap between the wage workers wanted and what was offered, satisfaction with compensation and upward mobility increased across the board.

With markets on edge over what the Fed’s next policy step will be, more signs of a tight labor market raise the likelihood that policymakers will keep interest rates higher for longer. At their July meeting, officials noted that wages “were still rising at rates above levels assessed to be consistent with the sustained achievement” of the 2% inflation goal, minutes from the meeting said.

Monday’s survey results also showed some other mixed patterns in the labor market.

Job seekers, or those who have looked for work in the previous four weeks, declined to 19.4% from 24.7% a year ago. That came as job openings fell by 738,000 to 9.58 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The likelihood of switching jobs fell, dropping to 10.6% from 11% a year ago, while expectations of being offered a new job also declined, to 18.7% from 21.1%.

Edit: This is a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) based out of Ireland for IP and taxation reasons. Due to the US-Irish tax treaty, American shareholder of RPRX must choose, when reporting taxation, as a Qualifed Elected Fund (QEF) selection or be subject to excess distribution tax regime. IF u elect to be a QEF, you will be taxed on your share net capital gains and ordinary income, and if not, all income and capital gains will be taxed at ordinary income rates, no matter holding period, though the capital gains can of course be deferred until share of sales unlike the QEF Selection.

Royalty Pharma buys royalty interests in late stage or approved/marketed pharmaceuticals or biotech products, and holds them until patent/royalty expiration. Due to increasing R&amp;D in biotech/pharma, they will be able to capitalize on the pharma industry funding partner as they have in the past, they have deployed over $20B+ in cash and have made up over half of all biopharma royalty transactions, but they are most definitely not price takers and though they target low teens IRR on their investments, though they have routinely beaten their conservative royalty income targets.

They IPO’d in June of 2020 at a pretty high valuation of roughly 20x-25x earnings post-warrant and share rights adjusted, at a valuation of 20B+ at their peak. After issuing extremely low interest rate debt  of 7.3B at an average coupon of 2.25%, they were able to maintain this premium valuation until the beginning of this year.

As of right now, the 2023 estimate for cash receipts or royalty revenue is 2.95B roughly, and with a 90% EBITDA margin, they are trading at roughly 8x EV/EBITDA. Though the portfolio WA life is 15 years, long-term growth of royalties is expected in this time in between LSD and MSD. 

Of course there is also a value to their investing platform as if they structured this as a perpetual capital private equity vehicle, I have no doubt they could charge 2/20 given their track record and with a good fund size. But even if we prescribed no value to the platform and just let the royalties run off, this is a steal.

The fact is that we can assume maintenance capex by looking at the average 13 year, 13% IRR target investment and realize we would need approximately 40%. Given 1/MOIC at the end of 13 years, we get a margin of 35%-45% (I’ll need to create a sensitivity table based off IRR tho). Thus we can consider cash flow margins of roughly 50% giving a yield of 7.60% which is growing 3%-4% annually, which is extremely attractive as the industry R&amp;D expands meaning more opportunities for investment, along with new more effective technologies possibly having higher approval and go-to-market rates.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey sorry for the short post, but I just felt that even though I am just starting to research RPRX, I would like other people to know about them as the opportunity seems clear. &lt;/p&gt;

481,stocks,"Once in a while, I get a message or an email, with a certain company name that has a price/book ratio below 1, and the question at the end is ""What am I missing"" or ""Does this make sense""?

The goal of this post is to elaborate on why a low price-to-book ratio doesn't necessarily mean a company is cheap. The post is divided into the following segments:

\- The theory

\- Example - Big Lots

\- Going concern

\- Conclusion  
**The theory**

The theory is quite simple. If a company has a price-to-book ratio of 1, the market price is in line with the book value of the company.

If the ratio is below 1, you can buy the **book value** of the company for a lower price. Should you buy a company with such a ratio, you get more than what you pay for (**in accounting terms**). 

On the other side, if the ratio is above 1, you'll be paying a premium compared to the **book value**.

I've bolded a couple of words, and that's where the catch is.  
**Example - Big Lots**

Although the theory is simple, the practice is not so much.

Let me introduce you to Big Lots, a furniture &amp; home decor retailer.

Its market cap is roughly $210m. Let's assume that you have the option to buy the entire company for $250 (a premium is often paid for a transaction of this type). **This is the price.**

If you take a look at the book value (which is total assets minus total liabilities), that is equal to $550 million! **This is the book value.**

Based on these two numbers, we can calculate a price-to-book ratio of 0.45.

So, can you not buy the entire business for $250, sell all the assets, pay all the liabilities, and collect the remaining $550? In this case, **we assume that the book value is equal to the liquidation value.**

  
*Imagine that you've done this. You've paid $250 million and now you own Big Lots. Now what?*

Let's see what that would look like in practice: Big Lots has total assets of $3.66 billion and total liabilities of $3.11 billion.

The 3 big buckets when it comes to assets are:

\- $1.1 billion of inventories  
\- $1.5 billion of operating leases (Right-of-use assets)  
\- $750 million of property, plant, and equipment

This explains over 90% of all the assets. So, how can this be converted into cash, so the liabilities can be settled, and you are left with $550 million?

&amp;#x200B;

***Inventories***

  
How can one get rid of $1.1 billion of inventories? There are two main ways:

1. As this is a retail company, you can choose to sell them through regular business operations. The catch? The company is not profitable. Over the last quarter, it sold $730m of inventories for $1.1 billion in net sales and reported a net loss above $200m. To sell $1.1 billion of inventories, it would take around 5 months, and it is quite clear that the outcome will not be $1.1 billion in cash, but closer to $700m (assuming the company losses $400m throughout these 5 months). But imagine what this would look like. You have all the stores with 100% inventory, then 80% inventory, then 50% inventory, then 20% inventory. It is unlikely that the inventory will go down to 0 unless special discounts are offered. Which means the $700m mentioned above, might be an overstatement.
2. You could call a competitor, and offer them the inventory. You'll likely hear a positive answer and an offer of $500m or $600m. Wait, you might ask, isn't the book value $1.1 billion? How come the offer is so low? Big Lots paid $1.1 billion to the manufacturing companies, to buy the inventory and have it delivered to their stores/warehouses. The competitors can do exactly the same, for the same price. In addition, the competitors don't have to order $1.1 billion at once and tie a lot of their capital. They could order a lot less. Therefore, you, as the new owner of Big Lots, have no negotiation power.  


Already, you can see that the **book value is not equal to the liquidation value**. This is only one of the three main assets of the business.

  
***Operating leases (Right-of-use assets)***

The previous owners/managers of the business, have signed numerous leasing contracts (for properties, equipment, vehicles, etc.) and these assets provide value to Big Lots. Canceling these contracts would also remove the lease liability on the other side of the balance sheet.

So, this should be straightforward, right? Not really, no.

To expect that you can ring anyone, and cancel the contract ""as of tomorrow"" is unreasonable.   
There will either be a notice period or a cancellation fee/fine.

  
***Property, plant and equipment***

At least this one should be easy, right? Well, I have some bad news.

Selling land &amp; buildings in today's market might not be the most difficult task. But how about all the equipment and vehicles that the company owns? I'm referring to the small ones such as stalls and cash registers, all the way to their forklifts and delivery vehicles.

To get rid of them on short notice, you'd have to sell them at a discount.

&amp;#x200B;

***What else is missing?***

This is not all. How about the employees? Liquidating a company of this size will not happen without severance pays.    
**Going concern**

So, why do we have those book values if they don't represent the liquidation value? Because there is something called **""going concern""**. It is a fundamental assumption, that the company (in this case Big Lots), will remain operating into the foreseeable future, rather than undergo a liquidation.

Therefore, the financial statements have been prepared on a **""going concern basis""**.  
**Conclusion**

This is a simple example, that illustrates how different the liquidation value might be compared to the book value. Imagine if there was $1 billion of goodwill on the balance sheet. That's not something that you can sell.

Let me be clear, this post has nothing to do with Big Lots and its value. It is solely here for educational purposes. There are plenty of scenarios that could happen to the company in the future. It could become profitable again, it could get acquired, it could go bankrupt, or it could be in a tough spot for a long time.

On the other side, think of companies with high price-to-book value in the tech industry. These companies do not have to invest heavily in assets, so using the price-to-book ratio is completely pointless.  
I hope you enjoyed this post, and as always, thank you for reading it until the very end. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in a while, I get a message or an email, with a certain company name that has a price/book ratio below 1, and the question at the end is &amp;quot;What am I missing&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Does this make sense&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this post is to elaborate on why a low price-to-book ratio doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean a company is cheap. The post is divided into the following segments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The theory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Example - Big Lots&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Going concern&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Conclusion&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory is quite simple. If a company has a price-to-book ratio of 1, the market price is in line with the book value of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the ratio is below 1, you can buy the &lt;strong&gt;book value&lt;/strong&gt; of the company for a lower price. Should you buy a company with such a ratio, you get more than what you pay for (&lt;strong&gt;in accounting terms&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, if the ratio is above 1, you&amp;#39;ll be paying a premium compared to the &lt;strong&gt;book value&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve bolded a couple of words, and that&amp;#39;s where the catch is.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Example - Big Lots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the theory is simple, the practice is not so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to Big Lots, a furniture &amp;amp; home decor retailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its market cap is roughly $210m. Let&amp;#39;s assume that you have the option to buy the entire company for $250 (a premium is often paid for a transaction of this type). &lt;strong&gt;This is the price.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take a look at the book value (which is total assets minus total liabilities), that is equal to $550 million! &lt;strong&gt;This is the book value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these two numbers, we can calculate a price-to-book ratio of 0.45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, can you not buy the entire business for $250, sell all the assets, pay all the liabilities, and collect the remaining $550? In this case, &lt;strong&gt;we assume that the book value is equal to the liquidation value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

*****
&gt; Stock futures were higher Monday as Wall Street tried to recover from another weekly decline.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.5%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 125 points, or nearly 0.4%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.6%.
*****
&gt; Palo Alto Networks jumped 12.4% in premarket trading after reporting earnings results late Friday that topped analysts’ estimates. As of Friday’s close, the stock was down by 16% this month.
*****
&gt; Investors are coming off a weekly decline as the market struggles through the summer doldrums. The Nasdaq Composite closed the week lower about 2.6%, down for a third straight week for the first time since December. Meanwhile, the Dow closed the week lower by 2.2%, its worst streak since March. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 2.1% and posted its third consecutive losing week, which hadn’t happened since February.
*****
&gt; Investors digested rising bond yields and weakness out of China that put a damper on markets during a typically lackluster season.
*****
&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 is sitting in short-term oversold territory, a technical measure encompassing numerous components including investor sentiment along with a host of more esoteric measures,” Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, wrote on Friday.
*****
&gt; Now, investors are awaiting the latest quarterly results from key artificial intelligence beneficiary Nvidia on Wednesday. They’re also anticipating an address Friday morning from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Monday, August 21st, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good Monday morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Monday, August 21st, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures nudge higher after another losing week on Wall Street: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock futures were higher Monday as Wall Street tried to recover from another weekly decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures tied to the S&amp;amp;P 500 gained 0.5%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 125 points, or nearly 0.4%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto Networks jumped 12.4% in premarket trading after reporting earnings results late Friday that topped analysts’ estimates. As of Friday’s close, the stock was down by 16% this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are coming off a weekly decline as the market struggles through the summer doldrums. The Nasdaq Composite closed the week lower about 2.6%, down for a third straight week for the first time since December. Meanwhile, the Dow closed the week lower by 2.2%, its worst streak since March. The S&amp;amp;P 500 dropped 2.1% and posted its third consecutive losing week, which hadn’t happened since February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors digested rising bond yields and weakness out of China that put a damper on markets during a typically lackluster season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The S&amp;amp;P 500 is sitting in short-term oversold territory, a technical measure encompassing numerous components including investor sentiment along with a host of more esoteric measures,” Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, wrote on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, investors are awaiting the latest quarterly results from key artificial intelligence beneficiary Nvidia on Wednesday. They’re also anticipating an address Friday morning from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.&lt;/p&gt;

# Introduction:

DUOL is a freemium app that offers language learning in a gamified form. It is the largest language learning app by subscriber in the market and the only one which can be used almost entirely free. Management's path forward is well defined, releasing an additional tier that utilizes generative AI to personalize the learning experience and leveraging off any future AI development to help with their business. Management has identified 3 broad areas that they are working on (1) how well they teach, (2) how well they monetize and (3) how well they retain.  


# Investment Thesis 1:

***Advantageous Business Model***  
DUOL is free to use as compared to their competitors, this easy access to DUOL may be advantageous as 67% of people want their language learning app to be free ([SOURCE](https://civicscience.com/the-word-on-language-learning-apps-whats-behind-their-growing-popularity/#:~:text=Single%2Dlanguage%20speakers%20are%20likely,become%20fluent%20in%20another%20language)). Their close competitors such as Rosetta Stone, Babbel and Busuu all require a monthly subscription. DUOL is currently the only language learning app to be able to offer their services for free (excluding in-app purchases) as they are supplemented by their advertising arm of the business. DUOL is the only one able to set up a significant advertising arm due to their very high Monthly Active Users (MAU).  


# Investment Thesis 2:

***Strong Word of Mouth Advertising***  
With the largest MAU out of all of their competitors this advantage snowballs on its own, DUOL is able to save a significant portion on advertising as their MAU helps DUOL to advertise. By posting their ""streaks"" or achievements e.g. year in review it helps to spread the word for DUOL. ""80% of Duolingo’s users were acquired through word of mouth"" ([SOURCE](https://www.adexchanger.com/strategy/organic-marketing-is-duolingos-lingua-franca/))  


# REVENUE:

  
DUOL’s management has recognized 2 sources of revenue  (1) “Bookings” and (2) Revenue. The difference is that Bookings represent the total potential revenue that can be collected from subscribers, whereas revenue is when DUOL has actually given the goods and services and can recognize revenue. I believe that in my forecast I should forecast revenue rather than bookings as subscription revenue is not actual revenue in pocket yet, subscribers could cancel at any point of time so I will apply the conservatism principle here.   
  
For Monthly Active Users(MAU), I’ll use Q4 of each year’s numbers.   
To Forecast MAU, I believe that DUOL’s subscriber growth trajectory will be similar to other subscription based model e.g. NFLX. They will experience explosive growth followed by mediocre growth as they switch to focusing on monetizing existing MAU. As DUOL has just started catching on, I assume that the high growth period will be 5 years followed by mediocre growth of 2 years before tapering to slow growth for the rest of my forecast. High growth Y/Y was taking historic trends, mediocre and slow growth is taking about half of the previous phase’s Y/Y.  
  
For Paid Subscribers, I’ll use Q4 of each year’s numbers.   
To Forecast Paid Subscribers, I took it as a %MAU. Opting for less granularity, I assumed that they follow historic trends and only had a meager increase. The reason for a meager increase is because I believe that consumers taste and preference for subscription remains more or less the same throughout my forecast.  
  
To Forecast Monthly Revenue/Paid subscribers, I’ll assume that the first 2 years the declining trend will continue as management has stated that they “lowered pricing -- prices in several countries to get our prices more in line with each country's GDP per capita.” - Q4 2022 Earnings Conference. After the 2 years, as the economy begins picking up I’ll assume a modest growth in monthly revenue/paid subscribers. And given that DUOL max will be developed and released to a greater extent I’ll assume that this helps the Y/Y as well. Overall Monthly Revenue/Paid Subscribers from 2020 had only a CAGR of 0.8% for my base case which I believe is realistic.  


# COST:

***Cost of Goods Sold***  
DUOL’s 2022 10-K has stated that COGS mainly comes from “third-party payment processing fees charged by various distribution channels”. Apple charges a 30% fee for app purchases. DUOL’s gross margins are slightly above this 30% fee at 73% mainly because there are other revenue sources that circumvent the app store e.g. Advertising. Opting for less granularity I’d forecast gross margins at 70% overtime as DUOL’s revenue sources becomes mainly subscription.   
  
***Operating Cost***  
R&amp;D, the fluctuations in R&amp;D will follow the CapEX cycle of 3 years of being half of historic average and 3 years of ramping up to scale for monetization before tapering off.   
  
Marketing, DUOL has stated that most of their advertisement is organic meaning that they don’t create ad campaigns but rather other users of a social media platform create content about DUOL. I’d assume that DUOL follows historic averages.  
  
G&amp;A, “We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. However, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will remain steady or decrease as a percentage of our revenues as our revenues grow faster than these expenses over the long-term.” - 2022 Q4 10-K. I assume that the nominal amount for G&amp;A grows at a meager rate before holding it constant at the end of the monetization phase.  


# CAPEX:

  
Management wants to capitalize past R&amp;D, “to continue to compound the returns we've seen from our past R&amp;D investments, so we don't plan to hire as many people as we did last year.” - Q4 2022 Earnings Conference. So I'd assume that CapEX has 3 years of being half of historic average and 3 years of ramping up to scale for monetization before becoming capital efficient.  
  


# Change in NWC Schedule:

  
  
***Day A/R and A/P***  
I don’t think that there is much room for DUOL to improve day A/R given that most of their receivables are from the AppStore and PlayStore. And management also has stated their intent to not shift payment methodology off the Stores according to the 2022 Q4 Earnings conference. I assumed the same will happen for Day A/P.  
  
***Deferred Cost of Revenue and Revenue***  
Forecasted as a % of revenue, it’s hard to predict which customers will or will not pay so I opted for less granularity.  


***Others***  
Forecasted as a % of revenue, I opted for less granularity.  


# WACC:

  
***Cost of Equity***  
RFR (1M Avg) = 3.82%  
Market Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DUOL/)) = 0.36  
Earnings Yield (1M Avg) = 3.98%

4050 = (4700 x 3.98%) / (1+R) + (4700 x (1+7%)) x 3.98% / (1+R)\^2 + (5029 x 3.98%) x (1 + 2%) / (R - 2%) / (1+R)\^3  
R = 9.12%   
ERP = 5.30%  
COE = 5.73%  
***Cost of Debt***  
DUOL does not have a bond rating, neither can I use a synthetic rating as DUOL has a negative EBIT. So the best case scenario here is to use management’s discount rate for debt. ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/y2RuXSG))  
COD taken to be 6.92%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21%  
After Tax COD = 5.47%

MV Equity = 5010.0M  
%Equity = 98.8%  
%Debt = 1.2%  
WACC = 5.73%  


# SANITY CHECK:

Worse Case: Subscriber Y/Y 9% CAGR  
Base Case: Subscriber Y/Y 12% CAGR  
Best Case: Subscriber Y/Y 15% CAGR  
Under the base case scenario, DUOL will be reinvesting a very large sum (inclusive of R&amp;D) for below historic ROIC by a significant margin. And I’m assuming a Y/Y CAGR of 12% for subscriber growth compared to 2022’s 40+% Y/Y. I do believe that my assumptions are realistic.  


# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, I value DUOL at $192.29 in my base case. I do believe that management has a clear direction in which they wish to take the firm in and have held true to their belief in AI since the very beginning. I believe that the language learning app is a product where consumers want it to be low maintenance i.e. Logging in daily to continue the streak without having to break the bank. With competitors product having a subscription model it stresses the consumer out having to ""make their moneys worth"".

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE: Purely Personal Opinion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUOL is a freemium app that offers language learning in a gamified form. It is the largest language learning app by subscriber in the market and the only one which can be used almost entirely free. Management&amp;#39;s path forward is well defined, releasing an additional tier that utilizes generative AI to personalize the learning experience and leveraging off any future AI development to help with their business. Management has identified 3 broad areas that they are working on (1) how well they teach, (2) how well they monetize and (3) how well they retain.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Investment Thesis 1:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advantageous Business Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUOL is free to use as compared to their competitors, this easy access to DUOL may be advantageous as 67% of people want their language learning app to be free (&lt;a href=""https://civicscience.com/the-word-on-language-learning-apps-whats-behind-their-growing-popularity/#:%7E:text=Single%2Dlanguage%20speakers%20are%20likely,become%20fluent%20in%20another%20language""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;). Their close competitors such as Rosetta Stone, Babbel and Busuu all require a monthly subscription. DUOL is currently the only language learning app to be able to offer their services for free (excluding in-app purchases) as they are supplemented by their advertising arm of the business. DUOL is the only one able to set up a significant advertising arm due to their very high Monthly Active Users (MAU).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Investment Thesis 2:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strong Word of Mouth Advertising&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With the largest MAU out of all of their competitors this advantage snowballs on its own, DUOL is able to save a significant portion on advertising as their MAU helps DUOL to advertise. By posting their &amp;quot;streaks&amp;quot; or achievements e.g. year in review it helps to spread the word for DUOL. &amp;quot;80% of Duolingo’s users were acquired through word of mouth&amp;quot; (&lt;a href=""https://www.adexchanger.com/strategy/organic-marketing-is-duolingos-lingua-franca/""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;REVENUE:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUOL’s management has recognized 2 sources of revenue  (1) “Bookings” and (2) Revenue. The difference is that Bookings represent the total potential revenue that can be collected from subscribers, whereas revenue is when DUOL has actually given the goods and services and can recognize revenue. I believe that in my forecast I should forecast revenue rather than bookings as subscription revenue is not actual revenue in pocket yet, subscribers could cancel at any point of time so I will apply the conservatism principle here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Monthly Active Users(MAU), I’ll use Q4 of each year’s numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Forecast MAU, I believe that DUOL’s subscriber growth trajectory will be similar to other subscription based model e.g. NFLX. They will experience explosive growth followed by mediocre growth as they switch to focusing on monetizing existing MAU. As DUOL has just started catching on, I assume that the high growth period will be 5 years followed by mediocre growth of 2 years before tapering to slow growth for the rest of my forecast. High growth Y/Y was taking historic trends, mediocre and slow growth is taking about half of the previous phase’s Y/Y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Paid Subscribers, I’ll use Q4 of each year’s numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Forecast Paid Subscribers, I took it as a %MAU. Opting for less granularity, I assumed that they follow historic trends and only had a meager increase. The reason for a meager increase is because I believe that consumers taste and preference for subscription remains more or less the same throughout my forecast.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Forecast Monthly Revenue/Paid subscribers, I’ll assume that the first 2 years the declining trend will continue as management has stated that they “lowered pricing -- prices in several countries to get our prices more in line with each country&amp;#39;s GDP per capita.” - Q4 2022 Earnings Conference. After the 2 years, as the economy begins picking up I’ll assume a modest growth in monthly revenue/paid subscribers. And given that DUOL max will be developed and released to a greater extent I’ll assume that this helps the Y/Y as well. Overall Monthly Revenue/Paid Subscribers from 2020 had only a CAGR of 0.8% for my base case which I believe is realistic.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;COST:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cost of Goods Sold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUOL’s 2022 10-K has stated that COGS mainly comes from “third-party payment processing fees charged by various distribution channels”. Apple charges a 30% fee for app purchases. DUOL’s gross margins are slightly above this 30% fee at 73% mainly because there are other revenue sources that circumvent the app store e.g. Advertising. Opting for less granularity I’d forecast gross margins at 70% overtime as DUOL’s revenue sources becomes mainly subscription. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Operating Cost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R&amp;amp;D, the fluctuations in R&amp;amp;D will follow the CapEX cycle of 3 years of being half of historic average and 3 years of ramping up to scale for monetization before tapering off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing, DUOL has stated that most of their advertisement is organic meaning that they don’t create ad campaigns but rather other users of a social media platform create content about DUOL. I’d assume that DUOL follows historic averages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G&amp;amp;A, “We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. However, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will remain steady or decrease as a percentage of our revenues as our revenues grow faster than these expenses over the long-term.” - 2022 Q4 10-K. I assume that the nominal amount for G&amp;amp;A grows at a meager rate before holding it constant at the end of the monetization phase.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CAPEX:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management wants to capitalize past R&amp;amp;D, “to continue to compound the returns we&amp;#39;ve seen from our past R&amp;amp;D investments, so we don&amp;#39;t plan to hire as many people as we did last year.” - Q4 2022 Earnings Conference. So I&amp;#39;d assume that CapEX has 3 years of being half of historic average and 3 years of ramping up to scale for monetization before becoming capital efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Change in NWC Schedule:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Day A/R and A/P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think that there is much room for DUOL to improve day A/R given that most of their receivables are from the AppStore and PlayStore. And management also has stated their intent to not shift payment methodology off the Stores according to the 2022 Q4 Earnings conference. I assumed the same will happen for Day A/P.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deferred Cost of Revenue and Revenue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

487,stocks,"Hey everyone! This post is going to breakdown Netflix. I am going to provide a detailed overview of the company and then find out if it meets our four investment principles (Circle of Competence, Competent Management, MOAT &amp; Margin of Safety). This is a very long post because I want to explain my rationale. This analysis is going to be broken down into four sections:

1. History/Overview of the Company
2. Qualitative Analysis
3. Quantitative Analysis
4. Buy Price

**History of Netflix:**

Netflix launched in 1998 as an online movie rental service. When Netflix began, they offered a subscription package allowing members to rent as many movies as they want for $19.95. The deal was that Netflix subscribers can keep DVDs, up to three at any one time, for as long as they wish. At the time, Netflix's largest competitor was Blockbuster, and funny enough, Netflix offered to sell their business to Blockbuster in 2000 and Blockbuster rejected the deal.This turned out to be a huge mistake for Blockbuster because Netflix forced Blockbuster into bankruptcy. How did Netflix go from offering their business to stealing consumers away from Blockbuster? There are four reasons which I will break down but the overarching answer is that Netflix just offered far more favourable options to consumers at a much lower cost. Let me explain.  
*Better deals:* Subscribers can order a movie online with next-day delivery. Netflix subscribers were able to hold on their DVD as long as they needed without late fees. When it's time to return a movie, a subscriber puts it back into the postage-paid mailers that came with and drops it into a mailbox with no shipping fees.  
*Forward thinking:* Netflix was investing in technology and consumers really liked the personalised recommendations by their software (Netflix recommends titles based on user's previous choices). Brick and Mortar stores like Blockbuster relied on store clerks who knew nothing about their customers' movie tastes.  
*Lower operating costs = better value for consumers:* In 2004, Netflix's logistics systems included only 30 distribution centres throughout the United States. A typical Brick and Mortar store like Blockbuster would take more than 500 video stores to serve the Los Angeles area, while Netflix served the same market with only one warehouse. Because of lower operating costs, Netflix were able to pass on those cost advantages to consumers, offering subscription rental around 50% cheaper than same-store subscription rental.  
*Online streaming:* Netflix invested in online streaming since they recognised that video-on-demand was gaining popularity. Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010.  
**Overview:**

Netflix is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 238 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Netflix is available virtually everywhere except in China and Russia. Members can play, pause, and resume to watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.While consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of “winning moments of truth”. In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.  
**Qualitative Analysis:**

Reed Hastings is currently Chairman of the Board and is the founder of Netflix. Reed Hastings has a history of purchasing Netflix shares indirectly and has a good compensation structure.

There is no doubt that Netflix has a lot of competitors. They compete against linear TV such as broadcast and cable television and other video streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Apple TV, Disney/Hulu, Youtube, HBO. However, Netflix does hold competitive advantages:

* *Linear:* Netflix is much more flexible over linear TV. Netflix is not competing for scarce time-slots whereas linear TV present programs only at particular time. Netflix is on demand, whenever someone wants to watch a show.
* *Netflix produces their own content with their own studio and this is becoming a major source of Netflix:* There is an argument that states Apple and Amazon does the same. Firstly Apple TV is operating at a loss in that segment and is relying on its more profitable lines to make up for that segment. Amazon Prime recently started operating at a profit however there are a few things worth noting.

1. Amazon Prime memberships are available in only 27 countries, whereas Netflix is available in over 190 countries. Furthermore, Amazon is very diversified so they have a limited focus, whereas Netflix's only focus is providing entertainment to consumers.
2. Netflix has a successful track record of producing local stories to reflect the different tastes in different countries and made them available and popular worldwide. Think of Netflix originals such as Money Heist (Spain), Squid Game (South Korea), Alice In wonderland (Tokyo, Japan). Without Netflix, a lot of international series and movies would have never achieved global penetration.  

3. Netflix original films bypasses the Cinemas and Netflix gets original access: This also makes Netflix a competitor to theatres, except that theatres have limited seats and time slots, Netflix does not.
4. Furthermore, Netflix licenses from other studios in the first pay TV window (the ""pay one"" window). This means Netflix gets first access after theatrical release of licensed content. Pay-one movies debut very well after theatrical release with a lot of viewership and Netflix has the ability to carry the film for 18-24 months. The result: Netflix has more viewing time than their competitors.

**Quantitative Analysis:**

Although Netflix has a bigger market share compared to other streaming platforms (some countries Youtube has the lead), Netflix market share is just under 10% so there is still significant room to grow.

This is where it is important to pay attention when it comes down to valuing Netflix. At first glance, it looks like membership growth is decelerating from 20% growth to under 10%. However, there are a couple things to consider.

* Last year, Netflix stock price plummeted due to losing memberships in Q1 and Q2. When Netflix reported losing -0.2 million subscribers in Q1, this was because they withdrew there services from Russia that resulted in a -0.7million impact on paid net adds; therefore, excluding this impact, paid net add would have been +0.5m.
* At the time, Netflix just announced paid sharing and there was a lot of initial negative reaction with consumers deleting their Netflix accounts. However, this turned out to be temporary and Netflix subscriber growth quickly improved after that. (One thing to keep in mind is this: *20 years ago, people were paying $5 for a single new rental DVD release, and around $60 for cable. Back then, the general cost of goods and services aren't anywhere like it is today due to inflation*. ***People will always pay for entertainment, so Netflix paid sharing impact on subscriber growth was always going to temporary.***
* Netflix has entered into the advertising business and so far it is proving to be successful. Consumers are benefitting because of lower price points, Netflix is benefiting because of increased subscriber growth and the advertising segment has better margins.  
How did I calculate Free Cash Flow?

Netflix pays a substantial amount each year for content and it is hard to determine what portion of that content spend is considered maintenance capital expenditure and what portion is considered growth capital expenditure. To make this process easy, I have calculated free cash flow by taking:

* Cash Flow from operations + Additions to Content Assets - Amortization of content Assets - Purchases of Property &amp; Equipment = Free Cash Flow.  
I also believe that this is a conservative estimate of Free Cash Flow because amortisation is on an accelerated basis. Over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is amortised within 4 years after it first becomes available. There are tax laws preventing management from speeding up depreciation of tangible property but since intangible assets such as content is extremely difficult to measure, management can speed up the amortization process. ***Management is incentivised to do this because a higher amortization expense (which is a non-cash expense) reduces the amount of taxes Netflix has to pay!***  


**BUY PRICE:** 

If you made it this far in the post then congratulations. My buy price ranges from ***$182 to around $250***. I have used the discount cash flow calculator using the current year free cash flow (2022). The former assumes a growth rate of 15% with a 15% discount rate. The latter assumes a growth rate of 10% with a 10% discount rate. I missed out on a bargain last year but I only began looking into Netflix a few weeks ago.  
I'll end this analysis with this quote.

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! This post is going to breakdown Netflix. I am going to provide a detailed overview of the company and then find out if it meets our four investment principles (Circle of Competence, Competent Management, MOAT &amp;amp; Margin of Safety). This is a very long post because I want to explain my rationale. This analysis is going to be broken down into four sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History/Overview of the Company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qualitative Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantitative Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy Price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History of Netflix:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix launched in 1998 as an online movie rental service. When Netflix began, they offered a subscription package allowing members to rent as many movies as they want for $19.95. The deal was that Netflix subscribers can keep DVDs, up to three at any one time, for as long as they wish. At the time, Netflix&amp;#39;s largest competitor was Blockbuster, and funny enough, Netflix offered to sell their business to Blockbuster in 2000 and Blockbuster rejected the deal.This turned out to be a huge mistake for Blockbuster because Netflix forced Blockbuster into bankruptcy. How did Netflix go from offering their business to stealing consumers away from Blockbuster? There are four reasons which I will break down but the overarching answer is that Netflix just offered far more favourable options to consumers at a much lower cost. Let me explain.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Better deals:&lt;/em&gt; Subscribers can order a movie online with next-day delivery. Netflix subscribers were able to hold on their DVD as long as they needed without late fees. When it&amp;#39;s time to return a movie, a subscriber puts it back into the postage-paid mailers that came with and drops it into a mailbox with no shipping fees.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Forward thinking:&lt;/em&gt; Netflix was investing in technology and consumers really liked the personalised recommendations by their software (Netflix recommends titles based on user&amp;#39;s previous choices). Brick and Mortar stores like Blockbuster relied on store clerks who knew nothing about their customers&amp;#39; movie tastes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Lower operating costs = better value for consumers:&lt;/em&gt; In 2004, Netflix&amp;#39;s logistics systems included only 30 distribution centres throughout the United States. A typical Brick and Mortar store like Blockbuster would take more than 500 video stores to serve the Los Angeles area, while Netflix served the same market with only one warehouse. Because of lower operating costs, Netflix were able to pass on those cost advantages to consumers, offering subscription rental around 50% cheaper than same-store subscription rental.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Online streaming:&lt;/em&gt; Netflix invested in online streaming since they recognised that video-on-demand was gaining popularity. Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Overview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 238 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Netflix is available virtually everywhere except in China and Russia. Members can play, pause, and resume to watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.While consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of “winning moments of truth”. In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Qualitative Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reed Hastings is currently Chairman of the Board and is the founder of Netflix. Reed Hastings has a history of purchasing Netflix shares indirectly and has a good compensation structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that Netflix has a lot of competitors. They compete against linear TV such as broadcast and cable television and other video streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Apple TV, Disney/Hulu, Youtube, HBO. However, Netflix does hold competitive advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linear:&lt;/em&gt; Netflix is much more flexible over linear TV. Netflix is not competing for scarce time-slots whereas linear TV present programs only at particular time. Netflix is on demand, whenever someone wants to watch a show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Netflix produces their own content with their own studio and this is becoming a major source of Netflix:&lt;/em&gt; There is an argument that states Apple and Amazon does the same. Firstly Apple TV is operating at a loss in that segment and is relying on its more profitable lines to make up for that segment. Amazon Prime recently started operating at a profit however there are a few things worth noting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Prime memberships are available in only 27 countries, whereas Netflix is available in over 190 countries. Furthermore, Amazon is very diversified so they have a limited focus, whereas Netflix&amp;#39;s only focus is providing entertainment to consumers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix has a successful track record of producing local stories to reflect the different tastes in different countries and made them available and popular worldwide. Think of Netflix originals such as Money Heist (Spain), Squid Game (South Korea), Alice In wonderland (Tokyo, Japan). Without Netflix, a lot of international series and movies would have never achieved global penetration.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix original films bypasses the Cinemas and Netflix gets original access: This also makes Netflix a competitor to theatres, except that theatres have limited seats and time slots, Netflix does not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Netflix licenses from other studios in the first pay TV window (the &amp;quot;pay one&amp;quot; window). This means Netflix gets first access after theatrical release of licensed content. Pay-one movies debut very well after theatrical release with a lot of viewership and Netflix has the ability to carry the film for 18-24 months. The result: Netflix has more viewing time than their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantitative Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Netflix has a bigger market share compared to other streaming platforms (some countries Youtube has the lead), Netflix market share is just under 10% so there is still significant room to grow.&lt;br/&gt;

494,stocks,"Is anyone else surprised that san francisco approved driverless taxis in the city??? I thought this would take years for regulations to pass


Anyways this is good news for tesla right? it looks like San Francisco might be the starting/testing ground for teslas robotaxi

For fun

Let's run through some rough numbers here, I'll probably be wrong on most of this

Right now uber drivers make 25-35 an hr on average in SF.

With tesla, they'll probably charge half that,  so let's say 15$ an hr.

People will be lending their cars out for robotaxi and tesla can supply their own cars too, but let's say people volunteer their tesla 

If tesla takes a 50% cut, that's 7.50 an hr, let's say they operate for 12 hrs a day


Well go with Roughly 10,000 teslas roaming around SF giving rides 

10,000 teslas giving rides for 12hrs a day at 7.50 an hr equates to about 

300 mill in a year Roughly in net profit. Not bad for 1 city.



At that rate it's most likely going well,  so it'll be approved slowly around the country, so maybe 50 cities 

Multiply 300 mil by 50, you have 16 bil in net profit which should raise marketcap by 160 to 300 bil

Oh and uber will most likely be doomed in the process as this is pretty much their core business.


This is a rough guess and estimate , tesla might change the numbers around in terms of profit sharing

498,stocks,"BP is a dividend-growing stock that is moving towards renewable energy while continuing to produce oil and gas. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the pandemic have affected the company's fundamentals, but they are stabilising and exhibiting growth potential. Due to its low valuation and strong dividend and buyback programme, BP makes an appealing investment. 

  
Although the corporation recognises that renewable energy sources hold great promise for the future of energy, it also takes advantage of business opportunities in the oil and gas industry. The corporation invests substantially in LNG (liquified natural gas), one of the most significant potential, and it will gain more notoriety as Europe stops importing natural gas from Russian pipelines. As Europe switches to renewable energy, BP can support the continent's gas demand.  
Across the board, BP is significantly investing in renewable energy. For customers waiting for their autos, it makes investments in EV (electric vehicle) charging stations and convenience stores. The fuels of the future, hydrogen and biofuels, are also investments. While hydrogen is clean, primarily green hydrogen, biofuels are carbon neutral. Having access to new green fuels and charging infrastructure will put BP in a good position going forward. Electricity will be used for transportation, and hydrogen and biofuels will be used in industries.

  
A recession is a significant risk for energy industries. During recessions, expenditure declines, which lowers demand for fuel and energy. Now that the economy must deal with rising rates, which decrease investments and spending, there is a possibility of a slump. The EPS of BP will be adversely impacted in the near and medium term if the world experiences a recession.  
The oil and gas sector, which makes up the majority of BP, will remain unchanged over the next few decades. The business also hopes to expand by making investments in brand-new areas related to renewable energy and green electricity. The corporation doesn't have the same advantage it does in oil and gas because it lacks knowledge in these areas.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d appreciate any insights or examples of when this might occur. Additionally, if there are any regulatory or legal factors that influence a company&amp;#39;s ability to fulfill a buyback promise, I&amp;#39;d like to learn more about them.&lt;/p&gt;

Then you have weird companies like Apple and Amazon who can take virtual losses forever in entertainment and not care. Netflix is weird because of all its custom content but has a massive catalog of back content to keep subscribers happy for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

What stocks to look at are the ones that rely only on content to stay alive. Those are the companies to be paying attention too. For instance I'd be very interested in how Warner Bro's/Discovery are going to be doing.  I'd also look at Sony who owes a lot to their entertainment divisions for profits (sure they do electronics and niche other areas), but they own some of the larger studios.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't want to make this a political topic but the Writers guild really needs to re-think their leverage. Sure the major studio's wont have new content coming out and already put a massive backlog and delays to projects. The major studios now are conglomerates that own so many other businesses they can keep moving along. They also don't realize that these studios will keep generating revenue but don't have to pay any of the writers, actors, production, etc... they have a freeze on money coming in but also a freeze on money going out.  The problem with industry consolidation + multi-faceted businesses is you lose your negotiating leverage.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear other peoples thoughts on this. What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

Especially their fear of AI As they know will becoming after their jobs. Netflix already was using it to determine what  shows and themes would be the most productive for returns. Disney/ILM started using it to replace opening credits. Disney even hired the group that for the end of Mando Season 2 were Luke showed up, another group of people showed they could do a better Deep Fake and they hired them. If I'm not mistaken Netflix used AI to write one of black mirrors episodes.

AI is coming and I can see why writers are so fearful. People are so naive on the idea that AI is coming for jobs even creative.

&amp;#x200B;

If anything I'd love to hear from people some of the VFX studios if they are public? That would be were I would start putting money into. Ones that are progressive and have a massive catalogue. It sucks ILM is private (Disney owned), Pixar (Disney Owned), Dreamworks, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish Epic which powers the majority of games but also the Volume that is used in almost all new TV productions.... was public but they are private for now.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

&lt;p&gt;Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you&amp;#39;re holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.&lt;/p&gt;

ENERGY TRANSFER TO ACQUIRE CRESTWOOD IN A $7.1 BILLION ALL-EQUITY TRANSACTION 08/16/2023 DALLAS &amp; HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET) (“Energy Transfer”) and Crestwood Equity Partners LP (NYSE: CEQP) (“Crestwood”) announced today that the parties have entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Energy Transfer will acquire Crestwood in an all-equity transaction valued at approximately $7.1 billion, including the assumption of $3.3 billion of debt, based on the closing price on August 15, 2023.

Under the terms of the agreement, Crestwood common unitholders will receive 2.07 Energy Transfer common units for each Crestwood common unit. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023, subject to the approval of Crestwood’s unitholders, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. Upon closing, Crestwood common unitholders are expected to own approximately 6.5% of Energy Transfer’s outstanding common units.

Complementary Assets

Crestwood’s system includes gathering and processing assets located in the Williston, Delaware and Powder River basins, including approximately 2.0 billion cubic feet per day of gas gathering capacity, 1.4 billion cubic feet per day of gas processing capacity and 340 thousand barrels per day of crude gathering capacity. If consummated, this transaction would extend Energy Transfer’s position in the value chain deeper into the Williston and Delaware basins while also providing entry into the Powder River basin. These assets are expected to complement Energy Transfer’s downstream fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu, as well as its hydrocarbon export capabilities from both its Nederland Terminal in Texas and the Marcus Hook Terminal in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

This transaction is also expected to provide benefits to Energy Transfer’s NGL &amp; Refined Products and Crude Oil businesses with the addition of strategically located storage and terminal assets, including approximately 10 million barrels of storage capacity, as well as trucking and rail terminals. These systems are anchored by predominantly investment-grade producer customers with firm, long-term contracts, and significant acreage dedications.

Positive Financial Impact

The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to distributable cash flow per unit as well as neutral to Energy Transfer’s leverage metrics upon closing. Similar to Energy Transfer, Crestwood’s cash flows are supported by primarily fee-based revenues from long-term contracts with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, with the increased scale and strengthened balance sheet, Energy Transfer expects to be able to improve on the current cost of financing for the acquired debt securities. Structured as a 100% unit-for-unit exchange, the transaction is tax-efficient to Crestwood unitholders and is anticipated to position both partnerships for long-term value upside through the combination.

Energy Transfer also expects to achieve at least $40 million of annual run-rate cost synergies before additional benefits of financial and commercial opportunities.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.crestwoodlp.com/investors/news/news-details/2023/Energy-Transfer-to-Acquire-Crestwood-in-a-7.1-Billion-All-Equity-Transaction/default.aspx""&gt;ENERGY TRANSFER TO ACQUIRE CRESTWOOD IN A $7.1 BILLION ALL-EQUITY TRANSACTION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now I realize that the FED is steamrolling inflation to 2% and they're hell bent on achieving that sooner than later, so companies won't be borrowing at these high costs anymore and growth will slow.

550,stocks,"# Introduction:

Hai Di Lao is the most popular hotpot restaurant in China and most of Asia. It's known for the extraordinary customer service and extremely cordial atmosphere. However, it may be tough to continue achieving the impressive Y/Y growth that HDL is used to due to a few reasons such as lack of clear management guidance, tough margins and the nature of the business.  


# Investment Thesis 1:

***Lack of Clear Management Guidance***  


Due to Covid-19, HDL's management had to strategically close down stores. Management recognizes the need to be more conservative and has laid out the ""Woodpecker"" plan. The plan is to close business that (1) have low customer traffic due to a lack of established business district, (2) Unsatisfactory performance (3) Areas with high HDL density.   
But beyond this plan, management did not lay out any other plans going forward. This opacity makes it hard to maintain confidence in management and whether they are steering the ship in the right direction or into an ice berg. With their earnings report usually laying out very vague plans on using technology to enhance the experience for customers or describing R&amp;D with very low barriers to entry.  


# Investment Thesis 2:

***Tough Margins***  


The Unique Selling Point (USP) for HDL may turn out to be a double edged sword. With very strong economic incentive to motivate employees, the margins for HDL may be significantly lower than other restaurants. This problem is temporarily buoyed by the weak housing market in China that allows HDL to buff their margins with very cheap rent. However, the areas for HDL to shave margins are low. This means that HDL's only other way of improving margins is to improve revenue through charging an even larger premium. However, I'm skeptical of whether HDL is able to do that or not as HDL is still a restaurant chain it is not an established restaurant that can command a very high premium.  


# Investment Thesis 3:

***Nature of  the Business***  


HDL's business model is that they would have a very interactive waiting areas e.g. Customers can fold paper cranes while waiting for their table to reduce their final bill. The longer the customers wait, the hungrier they get and the more food they will order. However, this also means that opening up restaurant has negative within firm externality. Customers could choose to simply head to another nearby outlet which is less crowded, which means that opening new restaurants may yield declining ROIC overtime. With the strong 996 culture in China, it may also mean that the restaurant business becomes less viable as customers have lesser time and patience for Hot Pot.   
The room for innovation in the hot pot restaurant isn't a lot and this lack of innovation may severely limit the potential margins for HDL.  


# Revenue:

I've assumed that HDL will carry out its Woodpecker plan for 2 years before proceeding back into growth mode for 5 years before slowing its pace of growth. Revenue/Restaurant will also increase as I assume that due to HDL closing down less effective stores and gaining even more brand goodwill the prices it can charge will increase as well.   


Forecasting number of restaurants to be opened, I followed historic Y/Y trends and overall had a CAGR of restaurants opened at 3%.

Forecasting Revenue/Restaurant, given that less effective restaurants are shuttered I’d assume that revenue/restaurant increases back to 2021 level by the end of the woodpecker plan before decreasing in the expansion years. And in perpetuity holding at higher than pre covid levels.  


Delivery pegged as a %restaurants, rationale being that as the business performs well the goodwill of HDL will carry, improving customer loyalty. Even though more restaurants may mean more convenience to just eat at the restaurant, due to China’s 996 culture it may not be a feasible option, so I purely consider this under the rationale of HDL’s goodwill improving.  
  
Same with the sale of condiments, the main reason for condiments to be sold is because of the strong goodwill for HDL and consumer’s trust in the quality of HDL so I’ve opted for less granularity. (You don’t see HDL advertising their condiments, and mainly sell in their own HDL stores, not supermarkets.)

# COST:

**RENT EXPENSE**  
Rent is significantly cheaper now than 2018 levels because of a myriad of reasons (1) During the property craze before China's 3 red lines was established there was a large influx of funds for property ([SOURCE](http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/PressRelease/202001/t20200119_1723643.html)) leading to supply of properties to increase drastically. (2) The collapse of Evergrande led to demand for property investment cooling off.   
I’d argue that this depressed rent cannot last forever, given that Rent Expense as a % of revenue went from 4% in 2018 to 0.9% in 2022. I’d assume that amount will bounce back to about 2.5%. However, that timing may take a very long while as defaulted property developers have to finish their development and it takes time to rebuild confidence. So I’d assume it takes about 10 years to bounce back to 2.5%.  
  
**STAFF COST &amp; RAW MATERIAL**  
From 2019 - 2021, as HDL was aggressively growing they did not manage their variable cost effectively so their Staff Cost &amp; Raw Material as a % of Revenue started ballooning. I believe at the end of the “woodpecker” plan these costs as a % of Revenue will drop back down to 2018 levels as HDL more effectively manages these costs. During the expansion plan, these costs will balloon back up to 2021 levels before dropping back down to even lower than 2018 as HDL now enjoys a significant amount of Economies of Scale.

Assumed to be a %revenue and opted for less granularity, forecasting it based on historical trends.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, I value HDL at RMB$12.55. I believe that my valuation differing from market's valuation could potentially be due to the opacity in Management's future plans. The Market may be more optimistic in how long they believe ""Woodpecker"" plan will last for and how high the growth of HDL can be. The optimism could also stem from the belief that Hot Pot will become more popular in other parts of the world, this international expansion was one aspect which I did not consider in my DCF.

&lt;p&gt;Hai Di Lao is the most popular hotpot restaurant in China and most of Asia. It&amp;#39;s known for the extraordinary customer service and extremely cordial atmosphere. However, it may be tough to continue achieving the impressive Y/Y growth that HDL is used to due to a few reasons such as lack of clear management guidance, tough margins and the nature of the business.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Investment Thesis 1:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of Clear Management Guidance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to Covid-19, HDL&amp;#39;s management had to strategically close down stores. Management recognizes the need to be more conservative and has laid out the &amp;quot;Woodpecker&amp;quot; plan. The plan is to close business that (1) have low customer traffic due to a lack of established business district, (2) Unsatisfactory performance (3) Areas with high HDL density.&lt;br/&gt;
But beyond this plan, management did not lay out any other plans going forward. This opacity makes it hard to maintain confidence in management and whether they are steering the ship in the right direction or into an ice berg. With their earnings report usually laying out very vague plans on using technology to enhance the experience for customers or describing R&amp;amp;D with very low barriers to entry.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Investment Thesis 2:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tough Margins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Unique Selling Point (USP) for HDL may turn out to be a double edged sword. With very strong economic incentive to motivate employees, the margins for HDL may be significantly lower than other restaurants. This problem is temporarily buoyed by the weak housing market in China that allows HDL to buff their margins with very cheap rent. However, the areas for HDL to shave margins are low. This means that HDL&amp;#39;s only other way of improving margins is to improve revenue through charging an even larger premium. However, I&amp;#39;m skeptical of whether HDL is able to do that or not as HDL is still a restaurant chain it is not an established restaurant that can command a very high premium.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Investment Thesis 3:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature of  the Business&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HDL&amp;#39;s business model is that they would have a very interactive waiting areas e.g. Customers can fold paper cranes while waiting for their table to reduce their final bill. The longer the customers wait, the hungrier they get and the more food they will order. However, this also means that opening up restaurant has negative within firm externality. Customers could choose to simply head to another nearby outlet which is less crowded, which means that opening new restaurants may yield declining ROIC overtime. With the strong 996 culture in China, it may also mean that the restaurant business becomes less viable as customers have lesser time and patience for Hot Pot.&lt;br/&gt;
The room for innovation in the hot pot restaurant isn&amp;#39;t a lot and this lack of innovation may severely limit the potential margins for HDL.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Revenue:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve assumed that HDL will carry out its Woodpecker plan for 2 years before proceeding back into growth mode for 5 years before slowing its pace of growth.

## Columns:
* Symbol: The ticker symbol or identifier for the stock.

* Buy Day: The day of the week when the stock typically has its lowest average return, making it the best day to buy.

* Sell Day: The day of the week when the stock typically has its highest average return, making it the best day to sell.

* Total Gain or Loss ($): The net gain or loss in dollars if one had followed the strategy of buying on the ""Buy Day"" and selling on the ""Sell Day"" for the entire period of historical data.

* Days with a Gain: The number of transactions (buy &amp; sell pairs) that resulted in a gain..

* Days with a Loss: The number of transactions (buy &amp; sell pairs) that resulted in a loss.

* Days of Data: The total number of days of data available for the stock.

* Notes:
The strategy assumes a fixed investment amount ($1,000) for each buy transaction.
The ""Total Gain or Loss ($)"" column considers all gains and losses from each buy-sell pair to arrive at a net result.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a script that pulls a bunch of data on about 3,200 stocks and decided to pull the last 10 years of stock prices.

 Interest Income increases its share of total revenue, given large portfolio expansions (+33% loan principal, +108% interest bearing assets), slightly higher NII. Non-interest income, however, seems more organically grown. Except the line “Loan origination and sales” (used to be 43% of net revenue in H1 2022, of which 70%), which captures fair value adjustments of loans originated or held in the relevant period, as well as gains on sales. In H1 2023, Gains on sales were aggregate $6.34m, while on page 17 cumulative fair value adjustments were shown as $260m (difference in cumulated fair value adjustments Dec-22, Jun-23) in the same period. There is another table on p 35, which indicates that impact on earnings of those adjustments were also captured in “interest income” and others were $91m for loans and $115m in total for the same period. These numbers don’t add up – where does the rest come from? Interestingly, despite way higher sales volume in 2022, gains were actually down quite a bit, despite them suffering some losses selling home loans in 22.

**Business Model problems:**

A large part of SoFis valuation is the unplanned high interest income, which is generated by forcefully holding loans for longer terms on the balance sheet (sales volume plummeted 86% yoy). The high percentage of charge-offs (3% on personal loans (1.25% in 2022) and 18% for credit cards (11.4% in 2022)) shows that underlying loan quality can’t possibly be that great. Most likely, those unsecured loans were advanced for refinancing (credit cards, pay now pay later, etc.) debt which very well can become toxic should financial conditions continue to tighten or economic conditions to start shifting. BAC’s credit card segment shows &lt;1% charge-off rates on 10.68% yield, which is bizarrely lower than SoFi’s personal loans. For comparison, BAC’s yield on personal/consumer loans was a mere 4.35% in H1 2023. Given those circumstances, one might wonder how shitty those loans actually are…

  
 What’s more, the market currently thinks that the re-commencement of student loan repayments is going to boost SoFi’s business, as many previously federal borrowers are going to refi with them. Just two problems; first, SoFi currently earns on average 4.93% interest on student loans. Given that SOFR and now 2yr treasuries are already at 5%, this should mean that fair value adjustments of student loans should actually be negative, when they aren't on their balance sheet. Compare that to SLM, which charges 7% on federally backed loans, and 10%+ on average on private loans (Maybe SoFi's loan quality is better or the originated more during pandemic years, but they hardly offer any data on their borrowers - which SLM does). Moreover, SoFi leverages approximately half its student loans via warehousing at a 564-691 bps rate, which does not make sense whatsoever. The only explanation is, that they have a very segregated portfolio of highly yielding (prop. 9%+) risky loans and a few high-quality low yielding ones, otherwise back-leveraging does not really make sense at higher borrowing costs than yields. Noted, that they’ve reduced their drawable commitment and got that facility probably in 0% SOFR times. But even if assumed, that the other half is funded by deposits costing 3.8-4.6 %, they really don’t make any money. Looking ahead, funding costs (warehouse and deposits) are likely to keep increasing at least for a year, while chargeable interest rates on student loans will be effectively capped by a 5.5% federal rate for eligible people. One might argue, ""Well what about falling rates, having loans yielding 4.9% is then really good"", well they're all going to refinance, same old problem back when we had wonderful CDOs etc.

554,stocks,"Bitcoin have recovered substantially from the precipitous drop seen last year as a result of rising interest rates, macroeconomic pressures, and the failure of FTX and other mining enterprises. While regulatory worries and extreme volatility continue to make equities dangerous, numerous analysts remain optimistic about the market. Comparison Toolsa are used to compare Coinbase Global ($COIN), Marathon Digital ($MARA), and Riot Platforms ($RIOT) to determine the most appealing mining stock.

# Coinbase Global ($COIN):

Coinbase Global has faced increased regulatory scrutiny, with the SEC suing the company for selling unregistered securities. Despite these issues, Coinbase shares have rallied by 128% this year. The company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, with revenue declining 12.4% to $708 million, but exceeding analysts' expectations. The loss per share narrowed to $0.42, better than analysts' expectation of $0.76. Lower costs and a surge in interest income contributed to the bottom line. However, investors were disappointed with the sequential decline in Q2 2023 trading volumes and the company's Q3 2023 guidance for subscriptions and services. Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley raised his price target for Coinbase to $80, maintaining a Hold rating. Wall Street is sidelined on COIN stock, with a Hold consensus rating based on six Buys, eight Holds, and eight Sells. The average price target of $80.68 suggests the stock could be range bound from current levels.

# Marathon Digital Holdings ($MARA):

Marathon Digital reported a Q2 2023 revenue surge of $81.8 million, driven by a 314% increase in Bitcoin production. This growth narrowed the reported loss per share to $0.13 from $1.94 in the previous quarter. However, the company also highlighted impressive growth in its hash rate and efficiency, with a 54% increase to 17.7 Exahashes per second (EH/s) in Q2 2023 compared to the first quarter. The company is targeting an operational hash rate of 23 EH/s through its new facilities in Ellendale, North Dakota and Garden City, Texas. Compass Point analyst Chase White reduced his price target for Marathon Digital to $20 from $21 and reiterated a Buy rating. With two Buys and two Holds, Marathon Digital scores a Moderate Buy consensus rating, with an average price target of $16.50, implying a 10% upside. Shares have jumped over 338% year-to-date.

# Riot Platforms ($RIOT):

Riot Platforms, a major Bitcoin miner in North America, has seen a strong rebound from last year's slump due to Bitcoin price increases and its expansion. The company reported mixed results for Q2 2023, with a lower-than-anticipated loss per share and a 27% increase in Bitcoin production. Roth MKM analyst Darren Aftahi reiterated a Buy rating on RIOT stock and raised the price target to $19.50. The company's Q2 2023 results showed a 19% reduction in mining costs and $13.5 million in power credits, which could improve efficiency in the second half of the year. Aftahi believes Riot Platforms has the potential to triple its hash rate from 10.7 EH/s to 35 EH/s by the end of 2025. The stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on eight unanimous Buys, with an average price target of $20.19, indicating 38% upside potential. Shares have risen over 332% since the start of this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Wall Street is positive on Riot Platforms but bearish on Coinbase and cautiously hopeful on Marathon Digital. Despite a great year-to-date performance, experts expect Riot Platforms stock to rise much more. Nonetheless, before making any investing decisions, investors should examine the significant risks and volatility connected with equities.

I'm looking at ASML at a potential stock and try to find a fair value to see if the current price is undervalued or overvalued.

Based on its Free Cash Flow (FCF) between 2014-2022, I obtain a CARGO of around 30%, and an average growth of 45%. As per finviz estimates an EPS growth of around 20% over the next 5 years.

Considering a growth rate of 18% over the next 10 years, a discount (WAAC) rate of 10%, I obtain a fair value $700, so its current price of $660 means it is undervalued.

However, I mean I remember that ASML stated that they expect some headwinds for the rest of the year, so I'm considering to DCA into the stock when it hits around $630.

Consumer spending held up well in July as inflation slowed, with retail sales turning in a stronger than expected showing for the month, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.  
  
The advanced retail sales report showed a seasonally adjusted increase of 0.7% for the month, better than the 0.4% Dow Jones estimate. Excluding autos, sales rose a robust 1%, also against a 0.4% forecast. Both readings were the best monthly gains since January.  
  
As the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, they showed a consumer able to keep ahead of price increases that have been prevalent over the past two years. The consumer price index rose 0.2% on the month, indicating solid demand.  
  
July’s numbers were boosted by a 1.9% jump in spending at online retailers, while sporting goods and related stores increased 1.5% and food service and drinking places rose 1.4%.  
  
On the downside, furniture sales slumped 1.8% and electronics and appliance stores reported a 1.3% drop. Gas station sales rose just 0.4% on the month despite rising prices at the pump.  
  
The report adds to the narrative that the U.S. economy may be able to avoid a much-predicted recession brought on by a series of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes aimed at controlling inflation.  
  
In a series of 11 increases since March 2022, the central bank has taken up its key borrowing rate by 5.25 percentage points to hits highest level in more than 22 years. Regardless, consumers, who power about two-thirds of the entire $26.8 trillion U.S. economy, have persevered.  
  
As saving has begun to dry up, shoppers have shown a willingness to use credit cards, the balances of which exceeded $1 trillion for the first time in the second quarter of 2023.  
  
July’s data showed that spending was widespread, with most categories showing increases. However, motor vehicle sales fell 0.3% as well. On a 12-month basis, sales rose 3.2%, which is exactly in line with the annual increase in the CPI.  
  
A separate report Tuesday, however, showed that inflation pressures linger after hitting their highest level in more than 40 years in the summer of 2022.  
  
Import prices move 0.4% higher in July, higher than the 0.2% estimate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was only the second monthly gain in 2023, as the year-over-year rate declined 4.4%. A year ago, the annual increase was 8.8%.  
  
Virtually all of the increase came from a 3.6% rise in imported fuel prices. Import prices were unchanged when excluding fuel, according to the BLS.  
  
Export prices, though, rose even more, gaining 0.7% on the month. However, they are down 7.9% from a year ago, after surging 12.9% from July 2021 to July 2022.  
  
An additional report Tuesday presented another mixed bag of data.  
  
The Empire State Manufacturing Survey, which gauges activity in the New York region, slumped 20 points in August to a reading of -19. That represents the difference between companies reporting expansion against contraction, and was much lower than the -1.4 Dow Jones estimate.  
  
New orders and shipments dropped sharply on the month, while prices paid and received both moved considerably higher.  
  
Despite the poor August reading, the index for future business conditions, which measures expectations six months out, increased to 19.9, a move up of 6 points. That came as new orders and shipments, the big drag in the current conditions survey, to “increase significantly,” while employment is “expected to grow considerably.”

A Fitch Ratings analyst warned that the U.S. banking industry has inched closer to another source of turbulence — the risk of sweeping rating downgrades on dozens of U.S. banks that could even include the likes of JPMorgan Chase. The ratings agency cut its assessment of the industry’s health in June, a move that analyst Chris Wolfe said went largely unnoticed because it didn’t trigger downgrades on banks. But another one-notch downgrade of the industry’s score, to A+ from AA-, would force Fitch to reevaluate ratings on each of the more than 70 U.S. banks it covers, Wolfe told CNBC in an exclusive interview at the firm’s New York headquarters. “If we were to move it to A+, then that would recalibrate all our financial measures and would probably translate into negative rating actions,” Wolfe said.

The credit rating firms relied upon by bond investors have roiled markets lately with their actions. Last week, Moody’s downgraded 10 small and midsized banks and warned that cuts could come for another 17 lenders, including larger institutions like Truist and U.S. Bank. Earlier this month, Fitch downgraded the U.S. long-term credit rating because of political dysfunction and growing debt loads, a move that was derided by business leaders including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. This time, Fitch is intent on signaling to the market that bank downgrades, while not a foregone conclusion, are a real risk, said Wolfe. The firm’s June action took the industry’s “operating environment” score to AA- from AA because of pressure on the country’s credit rating, regulatory gaps exposed by the March regional bank failures and uncertainty around interest rates.

The problem created by another downgrade to A+ is that the industry’s score would then be lower than some of its top-rated lenders. The country’s two largest banks by assets, JPMorgan and Bank of America, would likely be cut to A+ from AA- in this scenario, since banks can’t be rated higher than the environment in which they operate. And if top institutions like JPMorgan are cut, then Fitch would be forced to at least consider downgrades on all their peers’ ratings, according to Wolfe. That could potentially push some weaker lenders closer to non-investment-grade status.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/fitch-warns-it-may-be-forced-to-downgrade-dozens-of-banks.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/fitch-warns-it-may-be-forced-to-downgrade-dozens-of-banks.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

577,stocks,"&gt;***""I’ve been told I am crazy to raise member expectations this high as we head into bargaining,"" Fain said in his address. ""I refuse to allow employers, the billionaire class, and sellouts to play on our fears.""***

UAW president Shawn Fain raised some eyebrows during a Facebook Live video address in early August to the union faithful.

In an hour-long talk, Fain, a 20-year UAW veteran and a former shop chair at Stellantis' Kokomo, Indiana, plant, told members what he had planned for the Big Three automakers — GM (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLA), formerly Chrysler — for this year's contract negotiations. The bottom line was this: After all the sacrifices the UAW made over the years, the days of rolling over were done. The bill was due.

The stakes couldn't be higher for the UAW and the Big Three.

The current contract ends on September 14, at which point a work stoppage could occur if they don't strike a deal. The negotiations, if Fain's speech was any indication, will be the most contentious in recent memory. Why? Fain and current UAW leadership believe the union has given up too much in the past.

The increased rancor has already made a mark. Shares of GM, Ford, and Stellantis all dropped steeply last week, largely because Wall Street is concerned that a work stoppage would seriously impact automakers as they navigate a generational and costly electric transformation.

The increased rancor has already made a mark. Shares of GM, Ford, and Stellantis all dropped steeply last week, largely because Wall Street is concerned that a work stoppage would seriously impact automakers as they navigate a generational and costly electric transformation.

'These demands aren’t going to happen'

**The demands set out by Fain and UAW leadership include ""substantial wage increases,"" which amount to a 46% rise over three years; eliminating compensation tiers for new and old workers (which the UPS Teamsters secured); restoring cost of living adjustments; providing a new pension plan; and reducing work weeks to 32 hours from the standard 40.**

Making such demands in public ahead of contract talks isn't typical for the UAW and the Big Three automakers.

In the past, the UAW and Big Three went behind closed doors to negotiate after a contract was hammered out. The UAW then presented the proposed contract to its members for a vote.

Publicly releasing contract demands could backfire for the union, putting pressure on the leadership to avoid compromise and therefore up the likelihood of an impasse with the Big Three negotiators.

**But the tough-guy talk may be a plus: Fain, in essence, may be preparing the rank and file for a long, rough fight — a fight brought on by the costs facing the Big Three given these demands. According to Bloomberg, the cost of the UAW demands could amount to $80 billion over the course of the contract, which typically lasts three to four years.**

Fain's demands caught the automakers' leadership off guard.

""Everyone understands these demands aren’t going to happen — it would be suicidal for the companies to agree to this,"" one industry source told Yahoo Finance.

The UAW's wish list would amount to $25 billion-$30 billion per automaker over the life of the contract.

**""That adds $35 to $40 per hour to active labor cost — an increase of roughly 60%,"" the source said. The impact being that automakers would return to the ""bankruptcy era"" and more than double the labor costs for GM, Ford, and Stellantis versus non-union automakers like Tesla (TSLA).**

When reached for comment, a UAW spokesperson noted the industry source's take misrepresented a few key points.

""The Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor estimates that labor is just 5.1% of the cost of the average vehicle. That's a very important data point to take into account when the automakers claim that our demands will be catastrophic,"" UAW spokesperson Jim McNeil said.

McNeil also noted that the rising MSRPs of Big Three vehicles have not been driven by labor. ""[A recent study] published by the BLS shows that dealer markups have been driving up the costs of new cars, NOT labor costs.""

Finally, McNeil pointed to a recent statement made by Fain talking about the costs borne by UAW workers over the past decade and a half.

""Overall, the starting pay for a Big Three worker today is almost $21,000 less than it was in 2007 when adjusted for inflation,"" the statement said. ""UAW members made enormous sacrifices to save the automakers during the Great Recession, but we’ve never been made whole.""

A 'good faith' process

For its part, Big Three leadership has been striking more of a conciliatory tone, at least publicly.

GM President Mark Reuss recently told Yahoo Finance that GM is negotiating a deal ""that works for everybody in good faith.”

Meanwhile, Ford Chairman Bill Ford has said that the UAW isn’t the ""enemy"" and that he wants to find common ground.

But Stellantis, which just this week saw Fain throw its contract proposal into the trash in another Facebook Live video, said the UAW needs to focus on ""reality.""

""[The UAW] demands could endanger our ability to make decisions in the future that provide job security for our employees,"" Stellantis North America COO Mark Stewart said in a statement to employees, according to Reuters. ""This is a losing proposition for all of us.""
Wall Street wary

Wall Street, it seems, is anticipating the worst.

Last week CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson double-downgraded GM to Strong Sell and slashed his price target to $28 from $40. Nelson wrote in a client note, ""the growing risk of a UAW strike, given reports that the company and union remain extremely far apart in labor negotiations ... [and] newly-elected UAW President Shawn Fain appears to be aggressive and eager to make his mark with the Detroit Three.""

Nelson also said that the last UAW strike in 2019, which lasted 40 days, impacted GM’s earnings by $1.89 a share.

Morningstar automotive analyst David Whiston echoed those concerns, particularly for GM and Ford, which are more tied to the UAW compared to Stellantis, which has a bigger international labor presence.

""GM and Ford may be in the penalty box for a while. Wall Street hates uncertainty,"" Whiston said. ""This is not a normal negotiation, both in style and the demands they are asking.""

""This is a different time,"" longtime Detroit Free Press automotive writer Eric Lawrence told Yahoo Finance.

**""The union is talking in terms that they probably haven't talked in a long time. They've kind of come out swinging. They've kind of put the automakers on notice, and they've told the workers that they expect to fight for a lot of this contract.""**

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I’ve been told I am crazy to raise member expectations this high as we head into bargaining,&amp;quot; Fain said in his address. &amp;quot;I refuse to allow employers, the billionaire class, and sellouts to play on our fears.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAW president Shawn Fain raised some eyebrows during a Facebook Live video address in early August to the union faithful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an hour-long talk, Fain, a 20-year UAW veteran and a former shop chair at Stellantis&amp;#39; Kokomo, Indiana, plant, told members what he had planned for the Big Three automakers — GM (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLA), formerly Chrysler — for this year&amp;#39;s contract negotiations. The bottom line was this: After all the sacrifices the UAW made over the years, the days of rolling over were done. The bill was due.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes couldn&amp;#39;t be higher for the UAW and the Big Three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current contract ends on September 14, at which point a work stoppage could occur if they don&amp;#39;t strike a deal. The negotiations, if Fain&amp;#39;s speech was any indication, will be the most contentious in recent memory. Why? Fain and current UAW leadership believe the union has given up too much in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increased rancor has already made a mark. Shares of GM, Ford, and Stellantis all dropped steeply last week, largely because Wall Street is concerned that a work stoppage would seriously impact automakers as they navigate a generational and costly electric transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increased rancor has already made a mark. Shares of GM, Ford, and Stellantis all dropped steeply last week, largely because Wall Street is concerned that a work stoppage would seriously impact automakers as they navigate a generational and costly electric transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;These demands aren’t going to happen&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The demands set out by Fain and UAW leadership include &amp;quot;substantial wage increases,&amp;quot; which amount to a 46% rise over three years; eliminating compensation tiers for new and old workers (which the UPS Teamsters secured); restoring cost of living adjustments; providing a new pension plan; and reducing work weeks to 32 hours from the standard 40.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making such demands in public ahead of contract talks isn&amp;#39;t typical for the UAW and the Big Three automakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, the UAW and Big Three went behind closed doors to negotiate after a contract was hammered out. The UAW then presented the proposed contract to its members for a vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publicly releasing contract demands could backfire for the union, putting pressure on the leadership to avoid compromise and therefore up the likelihood of an impasse with the Big Three negotiators.&lt;/p&gt;

Japan’s economy posted its third straight quarterly expansion, provisional government data showed Tuesday, as robust export growth contributed to an annualized 6% expansion in the second quarter, handily beating market expectations.

Economist surveyed by Reuters had expected the world’s third-largest economy to post 3.1% growth in the April-June quarter. The impressive gross domestic product data translated to a more modest quarterly expansion of 1.5%, topping expectations for 0.8% growth.

The benchmark Nikkei 225 index extended gains slightly to trade up nearly 1%, while the Japanese yen pared losses against the U.S. dollar and Japanese government bonds across the various tenures were broadly unchanged.

Tuesday’s GDP print pointed to a continued post-Covid recovery for Japan’s economy. Still, this narrower gap between reality and expectation in quarterly growth tempers any longer-term optimism.

“Japan’s economy expanded at an extremely rapid pace last quarter, but we expect a renewed slowdown across the second half of the year,” Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.

“However, the details of the report weren’t as impressive as the headline,” he added. “Instead, nearly all of the increase in output was driven by a 1.8%-pts boost from net trade. That marked the second-largest contribution from net trade in the 28-year history of the current GDP series, with only the bounce back in exports from the first lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic providing a larger boost.”

Exports rebounded 3.2% from the previous quarter — largely driven by the spike in car shipments — while imports plunged 4.3% over the time period.

Other details beyond the rosy headline GDP growth figure suggest the Bank of Japan is likely to revert from its ultra-easy monetary posture.

A surprise 0.5% annualized drop in private consumption expenditure, along with muted capital expenditure pointing to muted domestic demand despite the first employee compensation sequential increase in seven quarters.

This comes as inflation has exceeded the BOJ’s 2% target for 15 consecutive months.

583,stocks,"The previously unknown partner in a $2 billion video game mega-deal that mysteriously and dramatically collapsed last spring was the Saudi government-funded Savvy Games Group, Axios has learned.

Why it matters: The fallout of the failed deal sent shares of The Embracer Group — Savvy's would-be partner, and one of the most voracious acquirers of video games studios in the last several years — plummeting, and forced it into cost-cutting mode.

More broadly, the revelation may raise questions about how Saudi Arabia will proceed with its controversial ambitions to invest $38 billion in the video game industry.

Driving the news: Axios learned of Savvy's involvement from four sources familiar with the deal who were not authorized to speak about it publicly, and after reviewing documentation related to the planned partnership.

An Embracer spokesperson declined to comment for this story. A Savvy rep did not reply by press time.

Catch up quick: The $2 billion deal would have involved Savvy investing in the development and publishing of games from Embracer, helping establish the Saudi company as a major gaming label.

Embracer had been promising investors news of a lucrative ""transformative partnership … with several industry partners"" since November 2022.

But in a May 24, 2023 note, Embracer management announced the collapse of one of those massive partnerships, while carefully avoiding naming the partner.

In the May note, Embracer said that the parties had reached a verbal commitment in October 2022 that would have resulted in more than $2 billion ""in contracted development revenue over a period of six years.""

""All documentation was finalized and ready to go as of yesterday,"" the company said. ""We asked for the execution of the agreement before our Q4 announcement. However late last night we received a negative outcome from the counterparty.""

While Axios' sources were clear about who the deal was with, they were less certain about why Savvy walked away.

Embracer and Savvy are both rising forces in the games industry, and have worked together before.

Embracer has risen to prominence in recent years through a string of acquisitions, including its May 2022 $300 million purchase of several elite studios, along with the rights to the iconic Tomb Raider gaming franchise. In August 2022, it announced a $365 million purchase for the rights to Lord of the Rings.

Savvy emerged in January 2022 with the news that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, or Public Investment Fund (PIF), was setting it up as an attempt to invest in gaming and diversify the Kingdom's economy. It immediately announced the $1.5 billion purchase of two esports firms.

The intrigue: Over the last two years, the PIF has become one of the largest shareholders in several major gaming companies, including Nintendo, Take Two Interactive and Electronic Arts.

Savvy committed to investing $38 billion in the gaming industry, and in April 2023 said it would purchase mobile gaming company Scopely for $4.9 billion.

Embracer and Savvy announced a stock deal last June, with the Saudi firm purchasing $1 billion worth of Embracer shares — a move Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors swiftly defended amid criticism that the investment would compromise his company's values.

While Savvy executives have told Axios and others that their operation, which has a board chaired by Saudi crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman, is a genuine effort to get into gaming and address the professional and leisure interests of the kingdom's youthful population, it's nonetheless been accused of being a distraction from the country's human rights record, similar to criticism of so-called ""sportswashing"" that's emerged from Saudi-backed efforts in boxing and golf.

What's next: Embracer will announce its latest quarterly earnings Thursday, when it may begin to detail cost reductions which it has promised to have in place by October 1.

Meanwhile, some Embracer divisions continue to announce new games. And Embracer still has a lucrative deal with Amazon, which committed in December to publish the next Tomb Raider game as it, too, attempts to establish itself as a player in big-budget gaming.

But some Embracer studio projects are getting canceled — and one studio, Campfire Cabal, announced last week that it was being shut down due to Embracer's restructuring.

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the revelation may raise questions about how Saudi Arabia will proceed with its controversial ambitions to invest $38 billion in the video game industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving the news: Axios learned of Savvy&amp;#39;s involvement from four sources familiar with the deal who were not authorized to speak about it publicly, and after reviewing documentation related to the planned partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Embracer spokesperson declined to comment for this story. A Savvy rep did not reply by press time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catch up quick: The $2 billion deal would have involved Savvy investing in the development and publishing of games from Embracer, helping establish the Saudi company as a major gaming label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embracer had been promising investors news of a lucrative &amp;quot;transformative partnership … with several industry partners&amp;quot; since November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a May 24, 2023 note, Embracer management announced the collapse of one of those massive partnerships, while carefully avoiding naming the partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the May note, Embracer said that the parties had reached a verbal commitment in October 2022 that would have resulted in more than $2 billion &amp;quot;in contracted development revenue over a period of six years.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All documentation was finalized and ready to go as of yesterday,&amp;quot; the company said. &amp;quot;We asked for the execution of the agreement before our Q4 announcement. However late last night we received a negative outcome from the counterparty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Axios&amp;#39; sources were clear about who the deal was with, they were less certain about why Savvy walked away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embracer and Savvy are both rising forces in the games industry, and have worked together before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embracer has risen to prominence in recent years through a string of acquisitions, including its May 2022 $300 million purchase of several elite studios, along with the rights to the iconic Tomb Raider gaming franchise. In August 2022, it announced a $365 million purchase for the rights to Lord of the Rings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Savvy emerged in January 2022 with the news that Saudi Arabia&amp;#39;s sovereign wealth fund, or Public Investment Fund (PIF), was setting it up as an attempt to invest in gaming and diversify the Kingdom&amp;#39;s economy. It immediately announced the $1.5 billion purchase of two esports firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intrigue: Over the last two years, the PIF has become one of the largest shareholders in several major gaming companies, including Nintendo, Take Two Interactive and Electronic Arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Savvy committed to investing $38 billion in the gaming industry, and in April 2023 said it would purchase mobile gaming company Scopely for $4.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embracer and Savvy announced a stock deal last June, with the Saudi firm purchasing $1 billion worth of Embracer shares — a move Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors swiftly defended amid criticism that the investment would compromise his company&amp;#39;s values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Savvy executives have told Axios and others that their operation, which has a board chaired by Saudi crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman, is a genuine effort to get into gaming and address the professional and leisure interests of the kingdom&amp;#39;s youthful population, it&amp;#39;s nonetheless been accused of being a distraction from the country&amp;#39;s human rights record, similar to criticism of so-called &amp;quot;sportswashing&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s emerged from Saudi-backed efforts in boxing and golf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s next: Embracer will announce its latest quarterly earnings Thursday, when it may begin to detail cost reductions which it has promised to have in place by October 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, some Embracer divisions continue to announce new games. And Embracer still has a lucrative deal with Amazon, which committed in December to publish the next Tomb Raider game as it, too, attempts to establish itself as a player in big-budget gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some Embracer studio projects are getting canceled — and one studio, Campfire Cabal, announced last week that it was being shut down due to Embracer&amp;#39;s restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I believe Walmart will take a nice sized dip this week after earnings, for the following reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

First and foremast, I'd like to compare Walmart to their direct competitor Target. Walmart is valued at 431.35B while Targets market cap is 59B (Walmart 7x Target).

&amp;#x200B;

Walmart trades at significantly higher PE ratio of 38.85 while Target is 22.29.

&amp;#x200B;

Walmart is up a whopping 22% this year, while Target has fallen 25%

&amp;#x200B;

One of the primary reasons for purchasing Walmart stock according to investors, is that it is a ""recession proof business""

&amp;#x200B;

I disagree with that point based on the fact that they already operate on absolutely razer-thin margins currently, and those will only decrease in a recessionary environment. Furthermore, shoplifting has been rapidly increasing YoY. Over 3 Billion dollars worth of products are stolen from Walmart every year. I can't imagine this will DECREASE in a recession, only INCREASE.

&amp;#x200B;

The smallest increases in shoplifting further decrease Walmarts already razer thin margin.

&amp;#x200B;

Comparing Walmart to Target may be a mute point as they are different businesses for sure. But I think this comparison shows the weakness of Walmart's hyper-thin margin business model and shows their overvaluation.

&amp;#x200B;

Second point: Ecommerce.

&amp;#x200B;

Walmarts Ecommerce division loses a significant amount of money. You will have likely notice this if you have ordered from their platform before. They will deliver same-day oftentimes, on already razer thin margin grocery items. This is a disaster for any profits. They have been trying to gain traction via 3rd party sellers on the platform, but this has not caught on at all and is mostly Chinese sellers with very high ship times.

&amp;#x200B;

Third point: Insider Selling

&amp;#x200B;

Insiders have been offloading incredible amounts of shares recently, with no purchases since March 15. They offloaded 3+ billion in shares the first half of 2023 and continued selling massive amounts of shares throughout the summer of 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

While these shares have been offloaded, the stock price has continued to rise, raising the fund &amp; retail % ownership of the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

Walmart has earnings on Thursday (8/17) and Target has earnings on Wednesday (8/16). I believe both of these earnings calls will impact Walmart share price negatively, and Target positively.

&amp;#x200B;

Weather you buy Target stock or short Walmart is up to you. But I believe this week we see a nice sized correction, shortening the gap between the two companies market cap.

Tesla is implementing significant price reductions for its vehicles in China, following a substantial 31% drop in sales for July from the previous month. To counter the downturn in the world's largest automotive market, Tesla has trimmed the starting prices of its China-made Model Y long-range and performance models by 14,000 yuan (around $1,900), a reduction of 4.5% and 3.8% respectively. Additionally, the automaker will offer insurance subsidies of 8,000 yuan for entry-level, real-wheel-drive versions of Model 3 cars, available between Aug. 14 and Sept. 30.  
  
The move comes amidst a broader global decrease in demand for electric vehicles, and local competitors such as BYD regaining market share with more favorable pricing. Sales of Tesla’s China-made cars have been on a decline since the end of 2022, although the automaker did see a 31% year-over-year increase in sales in China in February 2023.  
  
Despite the decline in China, Tesla's global vehicle deliveries in Q2 2023 hit a record high of 466,100 units, a quarter-over-quarter increase of about 10.23%.

594,stocks,"Pfizer stock has been severely damaged as investors sought alpha in AI plays, and the company's revenue hangover from the COVID vaccine is adversely hurting growth metrics.  Additionally, investors have been gravitating towards businesses that have a substantial exposure to weight-loss medications, such Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which have outperformed their sector peers. Given the generally bearish expert projections, the market is most likely set up for a weak Q2 announcement from Pfizer.  
With the exception of AbbVie (ABBV), the dividend yield is currently 4.3%, which is higher than that of any other pharmaceutical company. Additionally, AbbVie's share price is under pressure due to the loss of patent protection for Humira, a &gt;$20 billion selling medicine. Would you think that a 4.3% annual return on an investment with minimal downside risk—Pfizer's stock price rarely changes—would be a good return? It may not be the best company to have in a balanced portfolio, but interest rates are rising, so that may not be the case.  
Eliquis, which generated $6.5 billion in revenue for Pfizer in 2022, will lose its patent protection sometime around 2026. The Vyndaqel family of drugs, which treat hereditary forms of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (""ATTR-CM"") and generated $2.5 billion in revenue last year, and $1.8 billion from the sale of Xeljanz, are also expected to lose their patent exclusivity sometime around 2025.  
By 2027, generic versions of the oncology medications Xtandi, Ibrance, and Inlyta, which together generated close to $7.5 billion in revenue in 2022, may pose a danger. In fairness to Pfizer, its M&amp;A spending should help its ex-COVID product portfolio generate revenue growth over the coming years, despite the patents of several important drugs expiring. For context, AbbVie does not expect a single asset to go off patent between now and the end of the decade.  
Aside from the outrageous COVID profits, Pfizer is essentially the workhorse of the pharmaceutical industry, diligently advancing its mediocre (from a financial standpoint) but valuable (from a medical standpoint) pipeline and products while companies like Lilly advertise a self-injecting drug that causes you to lose weight and lose appetite. That may seem a bit cavalier towards Lilly, and it is unlikely that Pfizer intended for its stock price to remain so stable, but at the end of the day, 5.7 billion shares with virtually no room for growth and a dividend paying &gt;4% feel equally right.

604,stocks,"This week, I have an educational post, instead of a valuation one. It is all about impairment - a fancy term that I'm sure plenty of you have come across.  
The post is divided into 4 segments:

  
\- Impairment of tangible assets

\- Events that lead to impairment

\- Impairment of intangible assets

\- Impairment of goodwill

&amp;#x200B;

**Impairment of tangible assets**

Impairment, in the realm of accounting, refers to the **reduction of the value of an asset**.

Therefore, the first thing that we need to establish is, how is the value of an asset being measured, and why is this so important?

Let's start with a simple example. Imagine that there’s a company named XYZ, that owns a car, but there’s no employee with a driver’s license. Well, what can they do with the car? Nothing, but to sell it. So its value is equal to whatever the company can sell the car for, minus the costs that will be incurred in the process of selling. Let’s assume that this number was $20k. In accounting, this is the so-called ""**fair value less selling costs**"".

If the book value is $25k, that obviously doesn’t represent the fair value, and the car accounting-wise is overstated. Therefore, a $5k impairment would be recorded.

Now, let's imagine that there is someone who can drive it. In this case, the company can also derive value by using this asset. Therefore, the asset has so-called “**value in use**”. How can this asset be used? Plenty of ways. Let’s keep it simple, and assume that XYZ is a delivery business, and thanks to this asset, the company makes $2k net profit per month. The value of a business is the present value of future cash flows. Let’s assume that the value in use of the asset is $40k.

So, now, we have two numbers:

* Fair value less selling costs ($20k)
* Value in use ($40k)

On the balance sheet, the car is reported at $25k. So, is there an impairment? Which value should be used from the two above? The answer is - the higher one. That is the value of the asset to the business and that is referred to as ""**recoverable value**"". The company can ""recover"" $40k of value from the asset.

As the recoverable value of $40k is above the book value of $25k --&gt; There will be no impairment.

This so-called impairment test is mandatory and is done at least once a year.

  
**Events that lead to impairment**

There are plenty of events that could lead to impairment and they can be grouped into 3 categories:

1. **Change in demand** \- Remember the first example above, where the only option the company had was to sell the car? Well, if there is an adverse change in demand, that would lead to a lower price. So if the company is to sell the same asset, the cash received would be lower, leading to further impairment.
2. **Damage to the asset** \- Imagine if a tree falls over the car and it is now completely destroyed. It can no longer be sold for as much, and it can no longer be used. (Assuming there's no insurance on the car)
3. **Change in legal/economic condition** \- In the second example above, the business was generating $2k net profit per month. If the economic environment changes, and now the business is no longer as profitable, the value in use of $40k cannot be justified.

Although these are simple examples, if you understand this, you can follow the impairment of all physical assets.

Why would a company impair a building? Well, maybe the building is no longer in use, and the market prices declined significantly. Maybe there was a fire that damaged the building.

Why would a company impair inventory? The market prices could decline, it might be due to a flood that damaged the inventory, or it could be that the inventory became obsolete.

&amp;#x200B;

**Intangible assets**

Let’s introduce another company, named ABC, which owns a patent for cutting-edge technology. The company bought the patent from a start-up for $1 million. Based on the internal calculation, this patent will yield significant returns in the future and the price paid can be justified. So, on the balance sheet, there’s a patent reported with a book value of $1 million.

Recently, a few competitors developed similar technology, and the value of $1 million can no longer be justified. The estimated value in use has decreased and it is clear that an impairment would be recorded.

  
**Impairment of goodwill**

Now, let's bring the two companies together. The management of ABC decided that this whole patent cutting-edge technology is just not for them. Instead, they'll buy XYZ, the delivery business that owns a car. After running some calculations internally, they submitted an offer of $50k that was accepted.

So, they’re paying $50k for buying a car? Can they not buy a car and start their own business? Definitely, but it will take time until they get to the point of earning $2k/month. So paying more than the net assets value of a business is normal. They are also acquiring the customer relationships that XYZ built with its existing customers, the brand that was built over the years. These are intangible assets and some of them can be estimated.

So, on the balance sheet of ABC, there's $50k less cash, and instead, they got:

\- Car - $20k (the price if they are to buy the car on the open market)

\- Customer relationships - $10k

\- Goodwill - $20k

Goodwill is an accounting plug, that explains the entire cash outflow for an acquisition and it only occurs in this event. This is also subject to impairment.

When does it get impaired? When the value of the acquired business has declined and what is on the balance sheet can no longer be justified.

As mentioned earlier, the value of the business is the present value of the future cash flows. If the delivery business starts losing money and is expected to do so in the future, it is difficult to justify the $50k on the balance sheet. So, goodwill will get impaired. Impairment of goodwill is basically a result of a poor acquisition.

The management had certain assumptions, under which the value of the acquired company was estimated, and turns out they were wrong.

  
I hope that you enjoy this post, and I'll try to share more educational content.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, I have an educational post, instead of a valuation one. It is all about impairment - a fancy term that I&amp;#39;m sure plenty of you have come across.&lt;br/&gt;
The post is divided into 4 segments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Impairment of tangible assets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Events that lead to impairment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Impairment of intangible assets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Impairment of goodwill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impairment of tangible assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impairment, in the realm of accounting, refers to the &lt;strong&gt;reduction of the value of an asset&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the first thing that we need to establish is, how is the value of an asset being measured, and why is this so important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with a simple example. Imagine that there’s a company named XYZ, that owns a car, but there’s no employee with a driver’s license. Well, what can they do with the car? Nothing, but to sell it. So its value is equal to whatever the company can sell the car for, minus the costs that will be incurred in the process of selling. Let’s assume that this number was $20k. In accounting, this is the so-called &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;fair value less selling costs&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the book value is $25k, that obviously doesn’t represent the fair value, and the car accounting-wise is overstated. Therefore, a $5k impairment would be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;#39;s imagine that there is someone who can drive it. In this case, the company can also derive value by using this asset. Therefore, the asset has so-called “&lt;strong&gt;value in use&lt;/strong&gt;”. How can this asset be used? Plenty of ways. Let’s keep it simple, and assume that XYZ is a delivery business, and thanks to this asset, the company makes $2k net profit per month. The value of a business is the present value of future cash flows. Let’s assume that the value in use of the asset is $40k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now, we have two numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fair value less selling costs ($20k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value in use ($40k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the balance sheet, the car is reported at $25k. So, is there an impairment? Which value should be used from the two above? The answer is - the higher one. That is the value of the asset to the business and that is referred to as &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;recoverable value&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. The company can &amp;quot;recover&amp;quot; $40k of value from the asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the recoverable value of $40k is above the book value of $25k --&amp;gt; There will be no impairment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This so-called impairment test is mandatory and is done at least once a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Events that lead to impairment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of events that could lead to impairment and they can be grouped into 3 categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change in demand&lt;/strong&gt; - Remember the first example above, where the only option the company had was to sell the car? Well, if there is an adverse change in demand, that would lead to a lower price. So if the company is to sell the same asset, the cash received would be lower, leading to further impairment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damage to the asset&lt;/strong&gt; - Imagine if a tree falls over the car and it is now completely destroyed. It can no longer be sold for as much, and it can no longer be used. (Assuming there&amp;#39;s no insurance on the car)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change in legal/economic condition&lt;/strong&gt; - In the second example above, the business was generating $2k net profit per month. If the economic environment changes, and now the business is no longer as profitable, the value in use of $40k cannot be justified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these are simple examples, if you understand this, you can follow the impairment of all physical assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Customer relationships - $10k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Goodwill - $20k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodwill is an accounting plug, that explains the entire cash outflow for an acquisition and it only occurs in this event. This is also subject to impairment.&lt;/p&gt;

I know that no one can predict the future, I am just wondering if anyone can weigh in on insights regarding the likely outcome of FL earnings later this month.

610,stocks,"Hi everyone.

I am living in Denmark where the BYD Dolphin has just been introduced. I was amazed by the price which in Denmark is WAY lower than ID.3, Model 3, and other competitors. Even though the bells and whistles might be missing, the warranty and the things most important to most - how far can it drive on a charge, etc, - is looking very good. 

So I think BYD is going to overtake Tesla and the others at least in the very small market in Denmark. Which leads me to think it might also be the case in other European countries. And BYD is as far as I can read and research one of the largest Chinese automobile sellers and one of the biggest battery manufactures in the world. So they have a lot going for it.

BUT, the stock is OTC (not on one of the usual exhanges) and it seems it did a largest price jump some 4 years back where the value quadrupled. 

SO, I am wondering if there's a catch? Is the value fair? Should I be worried over OTC?

* EVs, EV charging, electrical transmission, and renewables all use a lot of copper, and are set to grow for the foreseeable future. 
   * For example, an EV uses at least 2x more copper than a gas powered car.
* There also isn't a clear replacement for copper in these products, meaning the price can continue to rise without destroying demand.
   * Aluminum is the most likely potential replacement, but not nearly as efficient (it would require a much higher volume of aluminum to do the same job).

**Supply will not keep up**

* Supply is expected to fall well short of demand in the 2nd half of this decade. 
* Ore grades are declining at many of the largest copper mines and there have been almost no major new discoveries in recent years.
* New copper mines can take 10 years to get up to full production, so they would not contribute to the supply equation until 2033.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** the world is going to need a lot of copper, there is no viable substitute, and the supply wont be there.

**Disclosure:** I am long COPX, FCX, IVPAF and IE, though these do not constitute a large % of my portfolio yet.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts? Am I missing anything? The most likely threat to the thesis above as far as I can see would be a breakthrough in extraction technology that dramatically increases supply.

# Financial Performance

* IonQ reported Q2 2023 revenue of $5.5 million, surpassing the high end of prior projections and marking a 111% growth from the $2.6 million in Q2 2022.
* The company posted $28.0 million in new bookings for the quarter, accumulating to $32.2 million for the first half of 2023.
* A net loss of $43.7 million was reported, with an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $19.4 million. 
* A non-cash loss of $15.5 million was attributed to IonQ’s warrant liabilities' fluctuation in fair value.
* As of June 30, 2023, the company held cash and cash equivalents totaling $509.2 million.  


# Commercial &amp; Technical Developments

* In partnership with QuantumBasel, IonQ has set up its inaugural quantum data center in Europe. This center is anticipated to house IonQ systems with capabilities of up to #AQ 35 and #AQ 64.
* The South Korean Ministry of Science and ICT has signed an understanding memorandum with IonQ, establishing the latter as a principal educator in quantum computing for South Korean students, researchers, and professionals.
* The release of IonQ Forte offers global developers access to the power of #AQ 29. This move was further solidified by IonQ's recently shared benchmarks, confirming IonQ Forte’s #AQ 29 performance capabilities.
* IonQ, collaborating with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, released a paper detailing the molecular structure modeling of the benzene molecule, marking it as potentially the most accurate model run on a quantum system.

# Future Outlook

* An exhaustive technical roadmap and forthcoming product specifications will be presented at the Quantum World Congress on September 27th.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 14th, 2023.

# **Nasdaq Composite slips Friday, falls two weeks straight for the first time in 2023: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/10/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite ended Friday lower and notched its second consecutive losing week in 2023 as semiconductor stocks languished.
*****
&gt; The tech-heavy Nasdaq slid about 0.6% to end at 13,644.85, pulled down by a selloff in semiconductor stocks such as Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia and Micron. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) ended the week down 5.2%, its worst week since October 2022.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 inched lower by 0.1%, ending at 4,464.05. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 105.25 points, or 0.3%, closing at 35,281.40. The 30-stock index was helped by advances of 2.1% and 1.8% in Chevron and Merck &amp; Co., respectively.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq declined about 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively, on the week. Both registered their second straight losing week — a first of that length for the technology-heavy Nasdaq since the conclusion of a four-week losing streak in December 2022.
*****
&gt; The Dow is an outlier of the three major averages, advancing 0.6% this week.
*****
&gt; Investors had much to celebrate earlier in the week.
*****
&gt; July’s consumer price index, a major inflation reading for markets and the Federal Reserve, came in softer than anticipated on a year-over-year basis. Prices climbed 3.2% on an annual basis, less than the Dow Jones consensus estimate of 3.3%.
*****
&gt; To be sure, the CPI reading showed some signs of stickiness. So-called core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 4.7% from the prior year.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Disney rallied on the back of its earnings report released Wednesday. Despite a pullback in Friday’s session, shares were 3.2% higher on the week. That marks the biggest weekly gain for the entertainment giant since March.
*****
&gt; But inflation data released Friday complicated the picture. July’s producer price index, which tracks the price wholesalers pay for raw goods, rose 0.3% from the previous month. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a 0.2% increase month over month.
*****
&gt; This week’s moves are the latest in what’s been a rocky patch for the stock market after a strong performance in the first half of the year. The three major indexes are all lower than where they began August.
*****
&gt; “Investors continue to try to hang their hat on more consistency” within economic data, said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments. “What we’re seeing with these mixed results certainly increases the likelihood of more volatility ahead.”

&gt; # Looking for a Mid-August Bounce After Weak Start

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/458b256926b027a6198d940e5576926d/7778c651dc41d06a-fb/s500x750/a5d8bb981b690e42143e64d57d6152168295aac5.jpg))**

&gt; Despite modest gains yesterday by DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, all the major indexes we track were down over the first eight trading days of August. As of yesterday’s close, August 10, NASDAQ was the weakest, off 4.24% this month. Russell 2000 was the second weakest, down 4.02%. S&amp;P 500 slipped 2.62% while DJIA was down 1.08%. Compared to past pre-election year August performance since 1950, this August has tracked closely. Should the market continue to track the historical pre-election year August pattern, a mid-month bounce could begin soon. This historical mid-month move is shaded in yellow in the following chart.

&gt; # Why $1 Trillion in Credit Card Debt Isn’t a Bad Thing

&gt; “It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.” -Henry David Thoreau

&gt; It finally happened, US consumers officially have more than $1 trillion in credit card debt, an all-time record. Not surprisingly, many claimed this was a sign the consumer was tapped out and simply spending and buying everything on credit cards. We don’t think it is that simple, in fact, we’d take the other side that this isn’t a major warning sign and the consumer is still quite healthy and not up to their eyeballs in debt.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-1-1-800x529.png))**

&gt; Every quarter the New York Fed releases their Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, and this is the report that just showed record credit card debt. Here’s a great chart that showed overall debt reached $17.06 trillion. Peeling back the onion showed that mortgage debt stood still at $12.01 trillion as of the end of June, making up a huge part of overall debt. Credit cards were up $45 billion to $1.03 trillion, meanwhile, car loans were at $1.58 trillion and student loans checked in at $1.57 billion.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-2-1-800x580.png))**

&gt; What stands out to me the most about the chart above is overall debt was virtually flat the past two quarters, from $17.05 to $17.06 trillion. Tells a much different picture than what the media makes it sound like with all the ‘soaring debt’, huh?

&gt; I really like the chart below from the NY Fed’s report that zooms in on the relative size of each part of debt. If you look at credit card debt specifically, it has consistently stayed in the same range over the long-term. So, credit card debt might be at a nominal record, but by no means are we seeing consumers go nuts buying everything on credit anymore than they ever have in history.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-3-1.png))**

&gt; Another way to think about this is wouldn’t people likely have more credit card debt if they were worth more? I call this ‘denominator blindness’. All we hear about is the numerator at a new high, but in a lot of cases, the denominator has been soaring as well. Go read the quote at the top from Thoreau again. I love that one, as there are different ways to look at things and to me, seeing the denominator is very important.

&gt; Here’s a good way to show this, overall net worth has increased significantly over time, from $44 trillion in 2000 to close to $150 trillion today. Maybe more credit debt shouldn’t be a surprise?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-4-1.png))**

&gt; Taking that same denominator blindness approach and looking at the percentage change of credit card debts and net wealth showed a much better backdrop. Since 2000, credit card debt has gained 106%, but net worth was up close to 250%. I will say it again, maybe more credit debt shouldn’t be such a surprise?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-5-800x545.png))**

&gt; Yes, rates are higher and there’s a lot of debt, so one logical question is: can consumers pay for all this debt? Here’s a great chart showing household debt service payments as a percentage of disposable income was down to 9.6% in the first quarter, well below the pre-pandemic average of 11.2%. In simple English, there might be a lot of debt, but people are making more money so it isn’t such a stretch to service all the debt. The second quarter data isn’t out yet, but given disposable income has increased and debt likely stayed flat, this will probably fall again soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-6.png))**

&gt; Here’s yet another way to show things aren’t as bad out there as it sounds. Credit card debt as a percentage of disposable income is 21%, still below the 22% from the end of 2019 and well beneath the 2003-2019 average of 26%. In other words, people have been making more than they have been adding to their credit cards the past few years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-7.png))**

&gt; But aren’t people just maxing out their credit cards? No they aren’t is the quick and simple answer. Here’s a chart that looks at credit utilization to show what we mean. Credit utilization is how much of your credit limit you are using. Sure enough, this has held steady at 22%, compared with the pre-pandemic level of 24%. Even home equity credit utilization is running at 38%, well beneath the historical average of 51%. Again, this might shock most people who saw on the nightly news how ‘high overall debt’ has been lately. It simply isn’t true.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-8.png))**

&gt; That’s enough about denominator blindness. Another thing we keep hearing is how consumers are in bad shape and the glass house is about to crack. Yet again, this just isn’t true, as delinquency balances didn’t increase last quarter, with 97.4% of total balances current on payments, unchanged from last quarter and higher than it was at the end of 2019. The chart below shows that delinquent balances that are more than 120 days late (including severely derogatory) are just 1.3% of total balances, below the 2.8% level before the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-9.png))**

&gt; There has been a jump in serious delinquencies on credit cards, but this is also simply getting back to more normal levels. The good news is other areas haven’t jumped higher yet.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-10.png))**

&gt; Here’s one that might shock most people, third-party collections hit an all-time low. If the consumer was in such bad shape like they keep telling us, this would probably show a much different backdrop. In fact, only 4.6% of consumers have collections against them, the lowest in history and well beneath the 6.3% from a year ago and 9.2% average through 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-11.png))**

&gt; Another way of showing consumers are in better shape than they keep telling us is business applications are soaring. In other words, entrepreneurship is soaring, not something you tend to see when people are worried about paying that next bill. Nearly 300,000 applications were filed the first half of this year, 2% more than last year and 21% above 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-12.png))**

&gt; I will end this blog (which turned out to be much longer than I expected) with some help from three of my friends.

&gt; First up, Callie Cox at eToro noted that credit card debt as a percent of total bank deposits was still historically low.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-13.png))**

&gt; Neil Dutta at RenMac noted that household balance sheets are in fine shape, as household debt to income fell to nearly 86% in Q2, the lowest level since Q4 2021. Neil surmises that it is incomes, not debt, that are the main drivers of consumption lately.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-14.png))**

&gt; Lastly, economists at Wells Fargo in a recent note said one major positive down the road is home equity. Consumers are sitting on trillions in equity and this could help in a lot of ways over the coming years. Read their great report for more on this concept.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-15.png))**

&gt; We are aware the headlines regarding record credit card debt, student loan forgiveness and now some talk of credit card forgiveness are causing much anxiety for investors. Our take is we doubt there will be any forgiveness plans, especially in an election year. Instead, these headlines are being used in the media to create more division, eyeballs and clicks.

&gt; The bottom line to us is the consumer remains in much better shape than the average investor realizes.

&gt; # Disinflation is Happening, And There’s More to Come

&gt; Inflation has been top of mind for investors over the past year and a half, both from the perspective of what that means for the economy as well as monetary policy. So, the latest release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks a basket of goods and services purchased by households, looms large every month. The big question going into this report was: inflation has pulled back, but will it stay lower and continue to pull back further?

&gt; Based on the July report, the answer is yes.
Headline CPI rose 0.2% in July, as was expected. Inflation was up 3.2% year-over-year, a tick below expectations for a 3.3% reading. That’s well below the June 2022 level of 9%. As you can see in the chart below, energy, food, and vehicle prices have driven inflation lower. 

&gt; Over the past year:
&gt; * Energy prices are down 12%
&gt; * Food price inflation has eased to 4.9% (it was 11% in July 2022)
&gt; * Used car prices are down 6%

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-headline-CPI-662x800.png))**

&gt; Looking at year-over-year numbers can be a little misleading, especially because they’re dependent on the data from a year ago and that’s not particularly helpful to understand what’s happening right now. At the same time, monthly data can be noisy. That is why I like to look at the 3-month average, and as of July, headline inflation is running at a 1.9% annual pace over the past 3 months.

&gt; We got good news on the core inflation front too, which is what the Federal Reserve focuses on since it removes volatile components like food and energy. Core inflation rose 0.2% in July, and over the last three months, it’s running at an annual pace of 3.1%. That’s a decisive shift lower from what we’ve seen over the past year and a half.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-headline-core-inflation-3M-changes-567x800.png))**

&gt; There are two big reasons why core inflation is pulling back, and it gets to why we believe inflation has more room to go lower. Vehicle and shelter make up 50% of the core inflation basket, and so what happens there is critical. Let’s talk about these.

&gt; As I noted above, used car prices are pulling back. In fact, private data indicates that used car prices have fallen 11% since March, but that’s yet to be fully reflected in official data. So, there’s further room to fall over the next couple of months. Also, new vehicle prices have fallen about 0.5% since March, and this could continue moving lower as auto production improves and inventories rise.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-used-car-prices-597x800.png))**

&gt; Shelter inflation has been decelerating for a while now. It was running at an 8-10% annual pace at the beginning of the year. That slowed to the 6-7% range between March and May, and over the last two months, it’s moved below 6%. That’s progress, albeit slow.

&gt; However, we know there’s a lot more room to go further down based on what’s happening in the rental market. Note that official shelter inflation does NOT include home prices and is just a measure of rents. Vacancies are up, and data from Apartment List shows that the national average rent is down 1% over the past year as of July.

&gt; Official shelter inflation may not get to that low a level, but safe to say, it’s heading a lot lower from where it is now. Shelter inflation averaged about 3-3.5% between 2018-2019, which was consistent with core inflation running at 2% (the Fed’s target). Based on what we know now, shelter could fall to an annual pace as low as 2.5%, and that would be a significant downward force on inflation.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-rnets-apartment-list-vs-official-598x800.png))**

&gt; Even beyond vehicles and shelter, there are positive signs.

&gt; A lot of supply-chain-impacted categories, like household furnishings and apparel, are also seeing disinflation. Airfares have been falling for four straight months now, with prices 20% lower from March. Even hotel/motel prices are down 4% over the same period. Of course, this is unlikely to continue, but it is more than welcome.

&gt; All in all, the big takeaway is that disinflation is happening, and we’re likely to see more of it going forward.

&gt; This also means the Federal Reserve is less likely to raise rates again at their September meeting. And if the inflation data progresses as we expect, the July rate hike may very well have been the last of the cycle. That’s going to be a big positive for investors as we head into the fall and winter.

&gt; # Bulls and Bears Beat the Average for Ten

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's selloff over the last week heading into today's CPI print caused bullish sentiment to dip a little. Compared to last week when 49% of respondents to the weekly AAII survey reported as bullish, this week only 44.7% reported as such. That is the weakest reading on optimism in a month, but remains well above the range of readings of most of the past year and a half.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The drop in bullishness was met with an increase in bearishness. Bearish sentiment rose back above 25% for the first time since the week of July 14th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; In turn, the bull-bear spread moved lower this week, crossing back below 20 to 19.2. That is the lowest reading in four weeks as the spread continues to point toward an overall bullish tilt to investor sentiment.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; In fact, this week marked the tenth in a row that bullish sentiment sat above its historical average while simultaneously bearish sentiment was below its historical average. Looking across the past twenty years, there are not many examples of this sort of extended bullish sentiment streaks. In fact, only three other periods saw streaks of similar length. The most recent ended in May 2021 at 13 weeks. Before that, there was an identically long streak in the first quarter of 2012 and prior to that, you'd have to go all the way back to 2004 to find an example. In the 1990s through late 2000, such streaks were much more common.

&gt; # Claims Seasonal Tailwinds Waver

&gt; Initial Jobless Claims have been back on the rise for the last two weeks with this week's reading coming in at 248k versus estimates for 230k. That is the most elevated reading since the first week of July and marks the largest week-over-week rise since the first week of June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; Before seasonal adjustment, claims totaled 225.6K, up roughly 20K from the previous week. At those levels, claims are above those of the comparable week of last year and multiple pre-pandemic years. The past couple of weeks have seen particularly pronounced seasonal tailwinds which have historically ebbed this week and will again likely happen next week. However, those tailwinds are set to continue later this month into September when claims have typically reached an annual low point.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Lagged one week to initial claims, continuing claims came in lower than expected, dropping to 1.684 million from 1.7 million. That is slightly above the low from two weeks ago but does not yet disrupt the trend downward in continuing claims.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-Claims-3.png))**

&gt; As for a state level breakdown of claims, in the heatmap below we show where continuing claims are most and least elevated as a share of the each state's respective labor force. As shown, the West Coast and Northeast are the two weakest regions of the country with the highest percentage of continuing claims. Some states in the Southwest like Texas and New Mexico and the Midwest like Illinois and Minnesota also have pockets of weakness. Given various states have different unemployment insurance program eligibility requirements, benefit amounts, and program lengths, that is not necessarily to say these are the areas with the highest unemployment rates, but rather these are the places contributing the most to national claims counts.

&gt; # Small Businesses Less Concerned With Inflation

&gt; In an earlier post, we noted the improvement to small business sentiment per the latest data from the NFIB. The report also includes survey responses as to what small businesses perceive to be their biggest problems. The July report showed that small businesses have begun to take notice of easing inflation. As shown below, throughout 2022 and into portions of 2023, inflation has ranked as the number one problem among small businesses. But in July, Quality of Labor retook the number one spot as it had temporarily back in May. Meanwhile, there has been a rise businesses saying that government requirements and red tape are their number one problem, tying cost of labor for the fourth most pressing issue.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-MIP-1b.png))**

&gt; Obviously, as it still occupies the number two spot, inflation remains a major problem. Even though it is a big improvement from 37% exactly one year ago, there continues to be 21% of firms that report inflation as their biggest problem. That is also well above any reading observed pre-pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-MIP-2.png))**

&gt; On a combined basis, cost and quality of labor are the most commonly reported problem for small businesses at 33% of responses. Unlike inflation which is hitting new lows, that is in the middle of the past few years' range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-MIP-5.png))**

&gt; Historically, the NFIB survey has had sensitivities to politics with a bias towards being more optimistic during Republican administrations and vice versa. Since the Biden Presidency began, government related problems have been on the backburner given that inflation has been playing a more pressing role. However, there has been a steadily rising number of responses once again reporting government red tape or taxes as their biggest issues. That has come hand in hand with an increase in the survey's Economic Policy Uncertainty Index which experienced a pronounced 4 point jump month over month in July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-MIP-3.png))**

&gt; Finally, we would note very few firms are reporting sales as their biggest problem. That is a significant disconnect from the index on actual sales changes which hit new lows in July.

&gt; # Small Business Sentiment Bounces Back

&gt; Small business sentiment from the NFIB's monthly survey rebounded in July with the headline index reading 91.9 versus expectations of it rising only 0.3 points to 91.3. As shown below, small businesses are still reporting much weaker optimism than pre-pandemic or even in the first year of the pandemic, but sentiment has been making steady improvements in recent months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-1.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we break down each category of the NFIB's survey. Again, the headline index remains historically low in the 14th percentile of readings. However, that is up from the 9th percentile last month. Most other categories that contribute to the optimism index also rose month over month, albeit there were multiple that went unchanged. As a result of those moves, most categories remain at the low end of their historical ranges with a couple of exceptions: Plans to Increase Employment and Job Openings Hard to Fill. Each of those readings are in the 76th and 94th percentiles, respectively. However, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, overall this survey's employment metrics have pointed to softening of labor market activity.

&gt; While several categories saw stronger readings in July, none rose more than Outlook for General Business conditions which jumped by 10 points month over month. That is the second 10 point increase in a row which makes for the largest two month increase since May 2020. Although that reading showed an increase in optimism which coincides with continued improvement in the number of firms reporting that inflation pressures have eased, readings on small businesses actual operations were less rosy. Even though sales expectations were up, actual sales changes hit a new low of -13, the weakest since the spring of 2020, resulting in earnings changes to also drop.

&gt; # Long End Historically Oversold

&gt; Treasury yields at the long end of the curve are once again rising today with the yield on the 30 year up 3.3 bps as of this writing. That is in the context of what has already been a dramatic move higher in yields of long term Treasuries. As we discussed in Friday's Bespoke report, the ETF tracking longer-dated Treasuries, the iShares 20+ Year US Treasury ETF (TLT), fell 1% or more three days in a row last week (prices fall when yields rise). Meanwhile, that move higher in long end yields has also been observed in other places of the world like Germany, as discussed in today's Morning Lineup.

&gt; Given the steep rise in yields and hence a drop in the price of TLT, the ETF is trading at extremely oversold levels. While it has come back slightly and is currently 2.66 standard deviations below its 50-day moving average, at the most oversold reading last Thursday, TLT traded 3.84 standard deviations below its 50-DMA. In its over 20 years of history, that is the most oversold reading on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080723-TLT-2.png))**

&gt; As shown above there have only been a handful of other periods in which TLT has fallen at least three standard deviations below its 50-DMA as it did last week. In most circumstances, when an asset reaches such extreme levels of oversold, the thinking is that some upside mean reversion can be expected. However, the exact opposite has played out for TLT historically. As shown below, across the prior seven instances in which TLT got 3+ standard deviations below its 50-DMA, the ETF was lower a year later four times.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and an awesome trading week ahead r/stocks. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Friday evening to all of you here on &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt;! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 14th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nasdaq Composite slips Friday, falls two weeks straight for the first time in 2023: Live updates - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/10/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq Composite ended Friday lower and notched its second consecutive losing week in 2023 as semiconductor stocks languished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tech-heavy Nasdaq slid about 0.6% to end at 13,644.85, pulled down by a selloff in semiconductor stocks such as Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia and Micron. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) ended the week down 5.2%, its worst week since October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 inched lower by 0.1%, ending at 4,464.05. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 105.25 points, or 0.3%, closing at 35,281.40. The 30-stock index was helped by advances of 2.1% and 1.8% in Chevron and Merck &amp;amp; Co., respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq declined about 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively, on the week. Both registered their second straight losing week — a first of that length for the technology-heavy Nasdaq since the conclusion of a four-week losing streak in December 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dow is an outlier of the three major averages, advancing 0.6% this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors had much to celebrate earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July’s consumer price index, a major inflation reading for markets and the Federal Reserve, came in softer than anticipated on a year-over-year basis. Prices climbed 3.2% on an annual basis, less than the Dow Jones consensus estimate of 3.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the CPI reading showed some signs of stickiness. So-called core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 4.7% from the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Disney rallied on the back of its earnings report released Wednesday. Despite a pullback in Friday’s session, shares were 3.2% higher on the week. That marks the biggest weekly gain for the entertainment giant since March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But inflation data released Friday complicated the picture. July’s producer price index, which tracks the price wholesalers pay for raw goods, rose 0.3% from the previous month. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a 0.2% increase month over month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s moves are the latest in what’s been a rocky patch for the stock market after a strong performance in the first half of the year. The three major indexes are all lower than where they began August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Investors continue to try to hang their hat on more consistency” within economic data, said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments. “What we’re seeing with these mixed results certainly increases the likelihood of more volatility ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Looking for a Mid-August Bounce After Weak Start&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/458b256926b027a6198d940e5576926d/7778c651dc41d06a-fb/s500x750/a5d8bb981b690e42143e64d57d6152168295aac5.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite modest gains yesterday by DJIA, S&amp;amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, all the major indexes we track were down over the first eight trading days of August. As of yesterday’s close, August 10, NASDAQ was the weakest, off 4.24% this month. Russell 2000 was the second weakest, down 4.02%. S&amp;amp;P 500 slipped 2.62% while DJIA was down 1.08%. Compared to past pre-election year August performance since 1950, this August has tracked closely. Should the market continue to track the historical pre-election year August pattern, a mid-month bounce could begin soon. This historical mid-month move is shaded in yellow in the following chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Why $1 Trillion in Credit Card Debt Isn’t a Bad Thing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.” -Henry David Thoreau&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It finally happened, US consumers officially have more than $1 trillion in credit card debt, an all-time record. Not surprisingly, many claimed this was a sign the consumer was tapped out and simply spending and buying everything on credit cards. We don’t think it is that simple, in fact, we’d take the other side that this isn’t a major warning sign and the consumer is still quite healthy and not up to their eyeballs in debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-1-1-800x529.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every quarter the New York Fed releases their Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, and this is the report that just showed record credit card debt. Here’s a great chart that showed overall debt reached $17.06 trillion. Peeling back the onion showed that mortgage debt stood still at $12.01 trillion as of the end of June, making up a huge part of overall debt. Credit cards were up $45 billion to $1.03 trillion, meanwhile, car loans were at $1.58 trillion and student loans checked in at $1.57 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What stands out to me the most about the chart above is overall debt was virtually flat the past two quarters, from $17.05 to $17.06 trillion. Tells a much different picture than what the media makes it sound like with all the ‘soaring debt’, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the chart below from the NY Fed’s report that zooms in on the relative size of each part of debt. If you look at credit card debt specifically, it has consistently stayed in the same range over the long-term. So, credit card debt might be at a nominal record, but by no means are we seeing consumers go nuts buying everything on credit anymore than they ever have in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about this is wouldn’t people likely have more credit card debt if they were worth more? I call this ‘denominator blindness’. All we hear about is the numerator at a new high, but in a lot of cases, the denominator has been soaring as well. Go read the quote at the top from Thoreau again. I love that one, as there are different ways to look at things and to me, seeing the denominator is very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a good way to show this, overall net worth has increased significantly over time, from $44 trillion in 2000 to close to $150 trillion today. Maybe more credit debt shouldn’t be a surprise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-4-1.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking that same denominator blindness approach and looking at the percentage change of credit card debts and net wealth showed a much better backdrop. Since 2000, credit card debt has gained 106%, but net worth was up close to 250%. I will say it again, maybe more credit debt shouldn’t be such a surprise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, rates are higher and there’s a lot of debt, so one logical question is: can consumers pay for all this debt? Here’s a great chart showing household debt service payments as a percentage of disposable income was down to 9.6% in the first quarter, well below the pre-pandemic average of 11.2%. In simple English, there might be a lot of debt, but people are making more money so it isn’t such a stretch to service all the debt. The second quarter data isn’t out yet, but given disposable income has increased and debt likely stayed flat, this will probably fall again soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s yet another way to show things aren’t as bad out there as it sounds. Credit card debt as a percentage of disposable income is 21%, still below the 22% from the end of 2019 and well beneath the 2003-2019 average of 26%. In other words, people have been making more than they have been adding to their credit cards the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But aren’t people just maxing out their credit cards? No they aren’t is the quick and simple answer. Here’s a chart that looks at credit utilization to show what we mean. Credit utilization is how much of your credit limit you are using. Sure enough, this has held steady at 22%, compared with the pre-pandemic level of 24%. Even home equity credit utilization is running at 38%, well beneath the historical average of 51%. Again, this might shock most people who saw on the nightly news how ‘high overall debt’ has been lately. It simply isn’t true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s enough about denominator blindness. Another thing we keep hearing is how consumers are in bad shape and the glass house is about to crack. Yet again, this just isn’t true, as delinquency balances didn’t increase last quarter, with 97.4% of total balances current on payments, unchanged from last quarter and higher than it was at the end of 2019. The chart below shows that delinquent balances that are more than 120 days late (including severely derogatory) are just 1.3% of total balances, below the 2.8% level before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a jump in serious delinquencies on credit cards, but this is also simply getting back to more normal levels. The good news is other areas haven’t jumped higher yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s one that might shock most people, third-party collections hit an all-time low. If the consumer was in such bad shape like they keep telling us, this would probably show a much different backdrop. In fact, only 4.6% of consumers have collections against them, the lowest in history and well beneath the 6.3% from a year ago and 9.2% average through 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way of showing consumers are in better shape than they keep telling us is business applications are soaring. In other words, entrepreneurship is soaring, not something you tend to see when people are worried about paying that next bill. Nearly 300,000 applications were filed the first half of this year, 2% more than last year and 21% above 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will end this blog (which turned out to be much longer than I expected) with some help from three of my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, Callie Cox at eToro noted that credit card debt as a percent of total bank deposits was still historically low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-13.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neil Dutta at RenMac noted that household balance sheets are in fine shape, as household debt to income fell to nearly 86% in Q2, the lowest level since Q4 2021. Neil surmises that it is incomes, not debt, that are the main drivers of consumption lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, economists at Wells Fargo in a recent note said one major positive down the road is home equity. Consumers are sitting on trillions in equity and this could help in a lot of ways over the coming years. Read their great report for more on this concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are aware the headlines regarding record credit card debt, student loan forgiveness and now some talk of credit card forgiveness are causing much anxiety for investors. Our take is we doubt there will be any forgiveness plans, especially in an election year. Instead, these headlines are being used in the media to create more division, eyeballs and clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line to us is the consumer remains in much better shape than the average investor realizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Disinflation is Happening, And There’s More to Come&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation has been top of mind for investors over the past year and a half, both from the perspective of what that means for the economy as well as monetary policy. So, the latest release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks a basket of goods and services purchased by households, looms large every month. The big question going into this report was: inflation has pulled back, but will it stay lower and continue to pull back further?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the July report, the answer is yes.
Headline CPI rose 0.2% in July, as was expected. Inflation was up 3.2% year-over-year, a tick below expectations for a 3.3% reading. That’s well below the June 2022 level of 9%. As you can see in the chart below, energy, food, and vehicle prices have driven inflation lower. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year:
* Energy prices are down 12%
* Food price inflation has eased to 4.9% (it was 11% in July 2022)
* Used car prices are down 6%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-headline-CPI-662x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at year-over-year numbers can be a little misleading, especially because they’re dependent on the data from a year ago and that’s not particularly helpful to understand what’s happening right now. At the same time, monthly data can be noisy. That is why I like to look at the 3-month average, and as of July, headline inflation is running at a 1.9% annual pace over the past 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got good news on the core inflation front too, which is what the Federal Reserve focuses on since it removes volatile components like food and energy. Core inflation rose 0.2% in July, and over the last three months, it’s running at an annual pace of 3.1%. That’s a decisive shift lower from what we’ve seen over the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-headline-core-inflation-3M-changes-567x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two big reasons why core inflation is pulling back, and it gets to why we believe inflation has more room to go lower. Vehicle and shelter make up 50% of the core inflation basket, and so what happens there is critical. Let’s talk about these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I noted above, used car prices are pulling back. In fact, private data indicates that used car prices have fallen 11% since March, but that’s yet to be fully reflected in official data. So, there’s further room to fall over the next couple of months. Also, new vehicle prices have fallen about 0.5% since March, and this could continue moving lower as auto production improves and inventories rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-used-car-prices-597x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shelter inflation has been decelerating for a while now. It was running at an 8-10% annual pace at the beginning of the year. That slowed to the 6-7% range between March and May, and over the last two months, it’s moved below 6%. That’s progress, albeit slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we know there’s a lot more room to go further down based on what’s happening in the rental market. Note that official shelter inflation does NOT include home prices and is just a measure of rents. Vacancies are up, and data from Apartment List shows that the national average rent is down 1% over the past year as of July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official shelter inflation may not get to that low a level, but safe to say, it’s heading a lot lower from where it is now. Shelter inflation averaged about 3-3.5% between 2018-2019, which was consistent with core inflation running at 2% (the Fed’s target). Based on what we know now, shelter could fall to an annual pace as low as 2.5%, and that would be a significant downward force on inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-10-rnets-apartment-list-vs-official-598x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even beyond vehicles and shelter, there are positive signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of supply-chain-impacted categories, like household furnishings and apparel, are also seeing disinflation. Airfares have been falling for four straight months now, with prices 20% lower from March. Even hotel/motel prices are down 4% over the same period. Of course, this is unlikely to continue, but it is more than welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the big takeaway is that disinflation is happening, and we’re likely to see more of it going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also means the Federal Reserve is less likely to raise rates again at their September meeting. And if the inflation data progresses as we expect, the July rate hike may very well have been the last of the cycle. That’s going to be a big positive for investors as we head into the fall and winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bulls and Bears Beat the Average for Ten&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500&amp;#39;s selloff over the last week heading into today&amp;#39;s CPI print caused bullish sentiment to dip a little. Compared to last week when 49% of respondents to the weekly AAII survey reported as bullish, this week only 44.7% reported as such. That is the weakest reading on optimism in a month, but remains well above the range of readings of most of the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drop in bullishness was met with an increase in bearishness. Bearish sentiment rose back above 25% for the first time since the week of July 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/081023-AAII-2.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In turn, the bull-bear spread moved lower this week, crossing back below 20 to 19.2. That is the lowest reading in four weeks as the spread continues to point toward an overall bullish tilt to investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this week marked the tenth in a row that bullish sentiment sat above its historical average while simultaneously bearish sentiment was below its historical average. Looking across the past twenty years, there are not many examples of this sort of extended bullish sentiment streaks. In fact, only three other periods saw streaks of similar length. The most recent ended in May 2021 at 13 weeks. Before that, there was an identically long streak in the first quarter of 2012 and prior to that, you&amp;#39;d have to go all the way back to 2004 to find an example. In the 1990s through late 2000, such streaks were much more common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Claims Seasonal Tailwinds Waver&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial Jobless Claims have been back on the rise for the last two weeks with this week&amp;#39;s reading coming in at 248k versus estimates for 230k. That is the most elevated reading since the first week of July and marks the largest week-over-week rise since the first week of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before seasonal adjustment, claims totaled 225.6K, up roughly 20K from the previous week. At those levels, claims are above those of the comparable week of last year and multiple pre-pandemic years. The past couple of weeks have seen particularly pronounced seasonal tailwinds which have historically ebbed this week and will again likely happen next week. However, those tailwinds are set to continue later this month into September when claims have typically reached an annual low point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lagged one week to initial claims, continuing claims came in lower than expected, dropping to 1.684 million from 1.7 million. That is slightly above the low from two weeks ago but does not yet disrupt the trend downward in continuing claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for a state level breakdown of claims, in the heatmap below we show where continuing claims are most and least elevated as a share of the each state&amp;#39;s respective labor force. As shown, the West Coast and Northeast are the two weakest regions of the country with the highest percentage of continuing claims. Some states in the Southwest like Texas and New Mexico and the Midwest like Illinois and Minnesota also have pockets of weakness. Given various states have different unemployment insurance program eligibility requirements, benefit amounts, and program lengths, that is not necessarily to say these are the areas with the highest unemployment rates, but rather these are the places contributing the most to national claims counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Small Businesses Less Concerned With Inflation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an earlier post, we noted the improvement to small business sentiment per the latest data from the NFIB. The report also includes survey responses as to what small businesses perceive to be their biggest problems. The July report showed that small businesses have begun to take notice of easing inflation. As shown below, throughout 2022 and into portions of 2023, inflation has ranked as the number one problem among small businesses. But in July, Quality of Labor retook the number one spot as it had temporarily back in May. Meanwhile, there has been a rise businesses saying that government requirements and red tape are their number one problem, tying cost of labor for the fourth most pressing issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-MIP-1b.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, as it still occupies the number two spot, inflation remains a major problem. Even though it is a big improvement from 37% exactly one year ago, there continues to be 21% of firms that report inflation as their biggest problem. That is also well above any reading observed pre-pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-MIP-2.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a combined basis, cost and quality of labor are the most commonly reported problem for small businesses at 33% of responses. Unlike inflation which is hitting new lows, that is in the middle of the past few years&amp;#39; range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the NFIB survey has had sensitivities to politics with a bias towards being more optimistic during Republican administrations and vice versa. Since the Biden Presidency began, government related problems have been on the backburner given that inflation has been playing a more pressing role. However, there has been a steadily rising number of responses once again reporting government red tape or taxes as their biggest issues. That has come hand in hand with an increase in the survey&amp;#39;s Economic Policy Uncertainty Index which experienced a pronounced 4 point jump month over month in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would note very few firms are reporting sales as their biggest problem. That is a significant disconnect from the index on actual sales changes which hit new lows in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Small Business Sentiment Bounces Back&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small business sentiment from the NFIB&amp;#39;s monthly survey rebounded in July with the headline index reading 91.9 versus expectations of it rising only 0.3 points to 91.3. As shown below, small businesses are still reporting much weaker optimism than pre-pandemic or even in the first year of the pandemic, but sentiment has been making steady improvements in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-1.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the table below, we break down each category of the NFIB&amp;#39;s survey. Again, the headline index remains historically low in the 14th percentile of readings. However, that is up from the 9th percentile last month. Most other categories that contribute to the optimism index also rose month over month, albeit there were multiple that went unchanged. As a result of those moves, most categories remain at the low end of their historical ranges with a couple of exceptions: Plans to Increase Employment and Job Openings Hard to Fill. Each of those readings are in the 76th and 94th percentiles, respectively. However, as we noted in today&amp;#39;s Morning Lineup, overall this survey&amp;#39;s employment metrics have pointed to softening of labor market activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080823-NFIB-1a.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While several categories saw stronger readings in July, none rose more than Outlook for General Business conditions which jumped by 10 points month over month. That is the second 10 point increase in a row which makes for the largest two month increase since May 2020. Although that reading showed an increase in optimism which coincides with continued improvement in the number of firms reporting that inflation pressures have eased, readings on small businesses actual operations were less rosy. Even though sales expectations were up, actual sales changes hit a new low of -13, the weakest since the spring of 2020, resulting in earnings changes to also drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Long End Historically Oversold&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasury yields at the long end of the curve are once again rising today with the yield on the 30 year up 3.3 bps as of this writing. That is in the context of what has already been a dramatic move higher in yields of long term Treasuries. As we discussed in Friday&amp;#39;s Bespoke report, the ETF tracking longer-dated Treasuries, the iShares 20+ Year US Treasury ETF (TLT), fell 1% or more three days in a row last week (prices fall when yields rise). Meanwhile, that move higher in long end yields has also been observed in other places of the world like Germany, as discussed in today&amp;#39;s Morning Lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the steep rise in yields and hence a drop in the price of TLT, the ETF is trading at extremely oversold levels. While it has come back slightly and is currently 2.66 standard deviations below its 50-day moving average, at the most oversold reading last Thursday, TLT traded 3.84 standard deviations below its 50-DMA. In its over 20 years of history, that is the most oversold reading on record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown above there have only been a handful of other periods in which TLT has fallen at least three standard deviations below its 50-DMA as it did last week. In most circumstances, when an asset reaches such extreme levels of oversold, the thinking is that some upside mean reversion can be expected. However, the exact opposite has played out for TLT historically. As shown below, across the prior seven instances in which TLT got 3+ standard deviations below its 50-DMA, the ETF was lower a year later four times.&lt;/p&gt;

* A fund is a basket of individual stocks, your portfolio is a basket of individual stocks.
* Look at the price chart of a stock before you even start researching it. Is the stock losing value every year or is the chart all over the place. Most likely it will keep doing that. Why waste your time with those when there are stocks where the value has been increasing for decades.
* In general individuals would do a lot better avoiding unprofitable companies. You in fact buying a stake in the ownership in a company when you buy the stock. If individuals thought more about ownership they would realize a profitable company makes more sense than an unprofitable one in terms of the future.
* Building your own portfolio does not mean you have to have high turnover in your stocks.
* If you have a losing stock, its weighting will decrease while the winning stocks weighting will increase. Thus a losing stock has a lesser and lesser impact over time.
* You are allowed to add and remove stocks from your portfolio just like the SP500 committee adds and removes stocks.
* You can build a portfolio that captures more upside than the SP500 and captures similar or less downside of the SP500. Basically you are sampling the SP500.
* The SP500 is actively managed by S&amp;P Global.
* Ignorance about stock market investing is very expensive.
* Past Performance Is Not Indicative Of Future Results, then how do people make projections on investing in the SP500 for long periods of time?
* People will say but you cannot beat the market for 30 years. Someone does not need to invest for 30 years, you can hit your financial goal much earlier and do something else afterwards.
* You do not have to beat the SP500 every year to do better than the SP500. You calculate the average of each year over at least a 5 year period then compare. I see people quit their plan because in the short term, the beginning, they may be underperforming.
* When people say that the failed at stock picking and to not do it, they don't list what the stocks were. A lot of the time if they ever reveal it, it is an unprofitable or struggling company with a price chart that has been descending for years.
* There are plenty of outperforming stocks within the SP500 but their weightings are so small, 0.1% in some cases, that they barely make a difference.
* If you can separate your feelings from investing you will do a lot better.
* If you know your statistics about the stock market you will do a lot better. Really just know the principles of basic statistics in general.

621,stocks,"The connection is straightforward: a dip in inflation is largely tied to plummeting energy and food prices.

In July 2023, the average WTI oil price dropped 23.49% as compared with July 2022. Meanwhile, natural gas prices plummeted by 63.31%, and corn by 17.27%. Observing these figures, particularly for natural gas, makes one question the rise in the CPI. The answer there lies in persistent core inflation.

Should commodity prices, especially oil, pivot from dampening overall price growth to driving it, we could anticipate multiple rate hikes from the Fed. In June, WTI's year-over-year decline stood at 38.54%, significantly greater than July's. This partly explains why July's CPI saw a 3.2% YoY growth following June's 3.0%. As we step into August, WTI is a mere 10.07% down from the previous year. If this trajectory holds, the CPI could surge by 4-5% by year-end.

Higher oil prices not only hint at steeper rates, but also increase the odds of an impending recession—a bleak prospect for stocks.

So, will oil prices maintain their ascent?

The IEA predicts an unprecedented global oil demand this year—at 102.2 million barrels daily, with an additional 1 million slated for 2024. Even if we discount the IEA's history of alarmist predictions, this forecast shouldn’t exactly come as a shock, especially when we recall that OPEC+ reliably curtails supply to bolster prices. In July alone, global supply shrank by 910,000 barrels daily due to Saudi Arabia's decision to pull an extra 1 million from the marketplace.

And yet the IEA also anticipates that in 2023, non-OPEC+ supply will climb by 1.3 million barrels daily, dwarfing the cartel's meager 160,000 increase. I'm inclined to anticipate that the market will soon face a surplus, stirring tensions within OPEC+ that will be reminiscent of pre-pandemic dynamics.

However, this development still likely lies a year in the future. Presently, the focus should be on gauging the authenticity of the demand resurgence, with China being the linchpin. Ascertaining the real situation in China always presents challenges. Although oil imports show signs of a revival, that metric doesn't necessarily point to robust demand. China might have just been capitalizing on low oil prices to bolster reserves, a frequent tactic. With prices rising, their excess purchases may taper off.

In essence, while a resurgence to $100 per barrel is conceivable, it likely hinges on geopolitical tensions. A more plausible outlook suggests stabilization within the $70-80 range.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection is straightforward: a dip in inflation is largely tied to plummeting energy and food prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, the average WTI oil price dropped 23.49% as compared with July 2022. Meanwhile, natural gas prices plummeted by 63.31%, and corn by 17.27%. Observing these figures, particularly for natural gas, makes one question the rise in the CPI. The answer there lies in persistent core inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should commodity prices, especially oil, pivot from dampening overall price growth to driving it, we could anticipate multiple rate hikes from the Fed. In June, WTI&amp;#39;s year-over-year decline stood at 38.54%, significantly greater than July&amp;#39;s. This partly explains why July&amp;#39;s CPI saw a 3.2% YoY growth following June&amp;#39;s 3.0%. As we step into August, WTI is a mere 10.07% down from the previous year. If this trajectory holds, the CPI could surge by 4-5% by year-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher oil prices not only hint at steeper rates, but also increase the odds of an impending recession—a bleak prospect for stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

629,stocks,"AI Mania Triggers Dot-Com Bubble Flashbacks

Nvidia shares have nearly tripled this year. Investors question whether the stock can live up to the hype.

The dot-com bubble taught investors to be wary of stock-market rallies powered by a technological boom—that is, until generative artificial intelligence sent tech stocks soaring this year.

Shares of Nvidia NVDA -0.39%, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the frenzy, have nearly tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16%.

For some investors, the surge in Nvidia—now the fifth-largest U.S. company by market value—is difficult to chalk up to anything but speculative mania. Its weighting in the benchmark stock indexes means everyday investors are at the whims of its trajectory, whether they believe in AI’s potential or not.

“There’s a huge boom in AI—some people are scrambling to get exposure at any cost, while others are sounding the alarm that this will end in tears,” said Kai Wu, founder and chief investment officer of Sparkline Capital. “Investors can benefit from innovation-led growth, but must be wary of overpaying for it.”

Nvidia is the primary producer of semiconductors backing artificial-intelligence systems. The company forecast a record $11 billion in sales for the recently ended quarter when it reported results in May, catching analysts off guard with the projected surge in customer demand.

“That’s when the excitement around AI really ramped up,” said Ryan McCormack, an Invesco senior exchange-traded fund strategist. 

The hype has driven companies such as Meta Platforms and Amazon.com that have been building out AI capabilities, he said. Shares of the tech giants are up 154% and 65% in 2023, respectively. Microsoft, which has climbed 35%, has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a chatbot that can answer difficult questions in seconds.

The furious rally in those stocks, long the market’s biggest drivers, has fanned worries about market concentration. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 now comprise more than a third of the market, according to Dow Jones Market Data. They represented 27% of the index at the start of the year and less than a quarter in 2000.

“The market story that rhymes most with the internet bubble is the concentration of leadership,” said Mike Edwards, deputy chief investment officer of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers.

Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings report, due Aug. 23, will provide insight into whether its inexorable rise is well-rooted in demand for chips, or a product of hype. The stock gained 24% in the trading session after its earnings reported in May, and 14% the day following February’s results.

Investors are paying up for the shares, betting on a windfall down the line. Nvidia is trading at 41 times its sales from the last 12 months, according to FactSet, compared with 2.4 times sales for the S&amp;P 500. On a forward basis, the stock trades at 20 times its expected sales for the year ahead—double its average over the last decade of 10 times, according to Dow Jones Market Data. 

The nascency of AI programs such as ChatGPT means it is likely too early to determine whether Nvidia can raise revenue in line with the eye-watering valuation investors have slapped on its shares. If the company’s growth isn’t enough to reflect its price, the stock could crater.

A basket of 43 high-multiple internet stocks—those worth at least $5 billion that traded at 25 times their revenue at the turn of the century—crashed 80% over the next two years, according to Sparkline. 

The companies weren’t duds, either. Their sales grew 10-fold in the ensuing two decades. But investors were badly bruised from the bust: The shares returned an average of 16% in that time span. The S&amp;P 500 returned 284%.

The basket included Amazon and Microsoft, both darlings of today’s market, along with Cisco Systems, then one of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100. The networking- equipment maker traded as high as 38 times its sales in early 2000. Cisco has returned 43% since the start of the century—it is down 0.4% when excluding dividends.

“Valuations matter,” said Wu. “Investing in stocks exposed to rapidly growing technologies only works if the growth is not already priced in. Unfortunately, in periods of euphoria, the market has a tendency not only to price in potential growth, but to greatly overextrapolate it.”

One reason why this rally might lack the boom-and-bust nature of the dot-com bubble: The beneficiaries of artificial intelligence were the stocks already shining this year. Investors were flocking to big tech in the first quarter, seeking shelter in strong balance sheets and cash flows.

Tech companies are also benefiting from the expected end of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate campaign and resilient consumer spending. Cyclical sectors of the broader market have begun to catch up now that recession fears are fading. 

“It’s not like 1999 when investors were racing to hot IPOs for companies that had no chance of making money,” said Edwards. “Today’s winners are disciplined, enormous companies that have moats in place and data sets to exploit.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI Mania Triggers Dot-Com Bubble Flashbacks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s when the excitement around AI really ramped up,” said Ryan McCormack, an Invesco senior exchange-traded fund strategist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hype has driven companies such as Meta Platforms and Amazon.com that have been building out AI capabilities, he said. Shares of the tech giants are up 154% and 65% in 2023, respectively. Microsoft, which has climbed 35%, has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a chatbot that can answer difficult questions in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The furious rally in those stocks, long the market’s biggest drivers, has fanned worries about market concentration. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500 now comprise more than a third of the market, according to Dow Jones Market Data. They represented 27% of the index at the start of the year and less than a quarter in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The market story that rhymes most with the internet bubble is the concentration of leadership,” said Mike Edwards, deputy chief investment officer of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings report, due Aug. 23, will provide insight into whether its inexorable rise is well-rooted in demand for chips, or a product of hype. The stock gained 24% in the trading session after its earnings reported in May, and 14% the day following February’s results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are paying up for the shares, betting on a windfall down the line. Nvidia is trading at 41 times its sales from the last 12 months, according to FactSet, compared with 2.4 times sales for the S&amp;amp;P 500. On a forward basis, the stock trades at 20 times its expected sales for the year ahead—double its average over the last decade of 10 times, according to Dow Jones Market Data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nascency of AI programs such as ChatGPT means it is likely too early to determine whether Nvidia can raise revenue in line with the eye-watering valuation investors have slapped on its shares. If the company’s growth isn’t enough to reflect its price, the stock could crater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basket of 43 high-multiple internet stocks—those worth at least $5 billion that traded at 25 times their revenue at the turn of the century—crashed 80% over the next two years, according to Sparkline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies weren’t duds, either. Their sales grew 10-fold in the ensuing two decades. But investors were badly bruised from the bust: The shares returned an average of 16% in that time span. The S&amp;amp;P 500 returned 284%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basket included Amazon and Microsoft, both darlings of today’s market, along with Cisco Systems, then one of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100. The networking- equipment maker traded as high as 38 times its sales in early 2000. Cisco has returned 43% since the start of the century—it is down 0.4% when excluding dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Valuations matter,” said Wu. “Investing in stocks exposed to rapidly growing technologies only works if the growth is not already priced in. Unfortunately, in periods of euphoria, the market has a tendency not only to price in potential growth, but to greatly overextrapolate it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason why this rally might lack the boom-and-bust nature of the dot-com bubble: The beneficiaries of artificial intelligence were the stocks already shining this year. Investors were flocking to big tech in the first quarter, seeking shelter in strong balance sheets and cash flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech companies are also benefiting from the expected end of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate campaign and resilient consumer spending. Cyclical sectors of the broader market have begun to catch up now that recession fears are fading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not like 1999 when investors were racing to hot IPOs for companies that had no chance of making money,” said Edwards. “Today’s winners are disciplined, enormous companies that have moats in place and data sets to exploit.”&lt;/p&gt;

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

632,stocks,"Sportradar (SRAD), may not be on everyone’s radar but it is certainly making waves in the market. Their Q2 2023 earnings report just dropped and the numbers are impressive.

The market has initially reacted negative to the earnings call but that may be due to FX movements hitting the bottom line. They have a lot of positives going forward.  
  
SRAD is less known compared to some giants in the industry, but it is proven itself a market leader with remarkable growth.  
  
In Q2 2023, their growth rate soared to 22%, and their year to date growth stands at an impressive 25%. They are doing all of this while maintaining profitability, something to appreciate in a volatile market.  
  
When we look at their closest rival, GENI, it’s clear SRAD is outpacing them by a significant margin. GENI achieved growth of 22% in Q2 but at a net loss of $10 million.  
SRAD sill made €10.5m profit last year after buying a bunch of companies and will hit €157 million to €167 million adjusted EBITDA this year.  
  
This contrast highlights SRAD’s ability to not only grow but also maintain a solid bottom line.  
  
One thing to note is that Q2 tends to be a slower period for sports betting stocks due to lack of major sporting events in June, so exhibiting growth during this period showcases SRAD’s resilience and strategic approach.  
  
As of 30th June 2023 SRAD had a total liquidity of €484 million including cash and cash equivalents of €264 million with an undrawn credit facility of €220 million. That is some serious spending power to further fuel their growth.

648,stocks,"Hello,

I was reading through the Duolingo Q1 sec filing report: https://investors.duolingo.com/node/8596/html

What I understand is:

* They had 115m revenue (32m spent on cost of revenues), spent 45m on R&amp;D, 16m on marketing, 30m on general &amp; admin
* They had a 2.6m net loss
* They have 650 employees
* They had a gain of 33m in cash flow

They have one utility (educational, learn languages) app, for those unfamiliar.

What I don't understand:

* How do you manage to spend (R&amp;D and administrative) 75m on 650 employees
* How can you get to a 2.6m loss, but an increase in cash flow of 32m (up to 641m in cash and cash equivalents)

My best explanation for the second one is that it's basically increase in their stock price?

But their expenses on one utility app, to get to a 2.6m loss, is baffling? It's 650 people working on one app, get 115m in revenue per quarter and you manage to spend it all?

My best guess is that they spent a lot into trying to get their monetisation in order, since the app was not really monetising until recently: https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-monetization/

Could someone enlighten me?

Now because of how much money they made in 2021-22 as a result of especially elevated European pricing, they paid down their debt to less than 1x their free cash flow, and since they immediately hedged more than half of their 2023-2024 production, and since oil prices, and to a certain extent gas prices have remained high, they will again have massive profits, and this time with their very conservative debt targets reached so that they can send most of it to their shareholders.

658,stocks,"If you look at the price chart, they have gone nowhere over 5 years but a little lower.

Most of their revenue are from sports game and Ultimate Team microtransactions, which isn't going to help the stock go up because they're just consistent cash cows that are already baked in to everyone's forecast and there's not much upside.

The only studio they have that has a shot of producing new hits that actually provides upside to the stock is Respawn. Apex Legends helped a lot, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was great as well but wasn't enough for this earnings call.

Do not mention DICE since their last blockbuster success was Battlefield 1 in 2018 and every Battlefield after that hasn't been successful. That was 7 years ago.

Besides Respawn &amp; sports games, nothing else matters for EA and I just don't see this stock going anywhere far as an independent company.

The next catalyst is the ATVI acquisition officially closing and should get EA back to the $130s. Then is how does the rebranding of EA's soccer game goes that you'll see during the holidays and as long as people buy the game still since there's no better alternative for soccer, it should stay at $130 and maybe touch $140.

After this I think they need to sell. Take advantage that they'll be the biggest pure-play video game company and with ATVI off the list big tech who wants to catch up with Microsoft should give a bid for EA. If they don't sell, I just don't see anything meaningful driving this stock higher.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the price chart, they have gone nowhere over 5 years but a little lower.&lt;/p&gt;

Believe it or not, I wrote this post yesterday at work, circa 3 hours before the news about the company and its shares skyrocketing. I'm from the field so I've heard about the drug for obesity around 3 months ago for the first time. Even though now probably not a good buy due to the momentum and hype, I'll post the original post anyway:

What's your opinion about Novo Nordisk (NVO). It's not the best buy right now and P/E is quite high, but I think the company has amazing moat. Diabetes and especially obesity is something that will keep increasing in incidence and the treatment with pharmacotherapy seems to be a booming field - with NVO already having a successful drug, Eli Lilly developing one, with other players joining the game. Treatment of obesity is supposed to be $100bn business within a decade.

I'm a psychiatrist and I think in our field alone, it's gonna be a game changer (obesity induced by antipsychotics and mood stabilizers). There's already very promising studies published. Then there's people with diabetes alone and general 1/3 of world's population that's... well, fat.

664,stocks,"PayPal has become the first major US fintech company to offer its own crypto token with a dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD. The company is entering an extremely crowded market already dominated by stablecoins like tether and USDC, at a time when the hype over cryptocurrency has largely fizzled and prices have been mostly stable with no big run-ups since 2022. PayPal's chief crypto executive, Jose Fernandez da Ponte, believes that stablecoins are the killer application for blockchains right now. ""Stablecoins are something that we cannot just sit out,"" da Ponte added. PayPal denied a Bloomberg report that the payments processor paused development of its stablecoin in February. The market is primed for new entrants that are fully backed and unlike tether, fully regulated. PayPal's launch comes after crypto liquidity plummeted in the last year and a half. The collapse of the crypto banking trifecta rippled into the stablecoin market, with Circle's USD Coin briefly losing its peg to the U.S. dollar. The total market cap of stablecoins has plunged since its peak, dropping 25% to $120 billion. PayPal's infrastructure, including being regulated in multiple countries, risk management, and compliance, is a key asset that is a difference in the approach that the company is taking.  
  
PayPal USD is a stablecoin that is backed by dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and cash equivalents and is redeemable for dollars. It is similar to USDC and is backed by a combination of dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents. The hypothetical digital dollar, CBDC, is a digital twin of the U.S. dollar, fully regulated, under a central authority, and with the full faith and backing of the country's central bank. There are both benefits and drawbacks to these forms, with some arguing that a CBDC in the U.S. would technically be safer than privately issued stablecoins because it would present a direct claim against a central bank. However, many people who deal in stablecoins want an easier way of doing business, especially internationally. PayPal is an alternative payments network built on top of the commercial bank system, offering interoperable, transparent, and faster settlement and cross-border settlement.  
  
Stablecoins originally emerged to cater to demand for dollar exposure offshore and overseas, but nongovernmental digital tokens are increasingly being used in domestic and international transactions, which is scary for central banks. PayPal's chief crypto executive, Nic Carter, believes the payment processor has a place in the dollar-pegged stablecoin sector by enlarging the pie and offering a more accessible market.

**Why the Stock Dropped:**
The decline in Datadog's stock can be attributed to the company's revenue forecast falling short of expectations for the rest of the year.

Although Q2 results showed improvements and topped expectations, the Q3 and full-year outlook missed analyst forecasts, causing investor concerns and leading to the 20% drop in the stock.

**Q3 Forecast:**
- **Revenue:** $521 million to $525 million (below consensus of $536 million).
- **Adjusted EPS:** 33 to 35 cents (above consensus of 29 cents).

**Full-Year Outlook:**
- **Revenue:** $2.05 billion to $2.06 billion (analysts expected $2.24 billion).
- **Adjusted EPS:** $1.30 to $1.34 (analysts expected $1.18).

**Q2 Performance:**
- **Net Loss:** $4.0 million, improving from a loss of $4.88 million YoY.
- **Adjusted EPS:** 36 cents (analysts expected 28 cents).
- **Revenue:** $509.5 million, up 25% YoY (above consensus of $501.6 million).

**Customers:** Around **2,990** customers with annual recurring revenue over $100,000.

684,stocks,"Eli Lilly on Tuesday raised its full-year guidance as second-quarter profit jumped 85% from the same period a year ago on strong sales from the pharmaceutical giant's diabetes treatment Mounjaro and other drugs.

The company now expects full-year revenue of between $33.4 billion and $33.9 billion, up from a previous forecast of $31.2 billion to $31.7 billion. Eli Lilly also increased its adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $9.70 to $9.90 per share for the year, up from a range of $8.65 to $8.85.

Shares of Eli Lilly surged 14% Tuesday.

Eli Lilly beat Wall Street expectations:

* **Adjusted earnings:** $2.11 per share, vs. $1.98 per share expected
* **Revenue:** $8.31 billion, vs. $7.58 billion expected

Accounting for charges associated with some intangible assets and losses on securities, the company recorded adjusted income of $1.9 billion, or $2.11 per share.

The company's $8.31 billion in sales for the quarter marked a 28% increase from the same period a year ago. 

## Drug results

Revenue growth was also driven by sales of breast cancer pill Verzenio, which rose 57% to $926.8 million for the quarter. Sales of Jardiance, a tablet that lowers blood sugar in Type 2 diabetes patients, climbed 45% to $668.3 million for the second quarter.

Newer drugs like Mounjaro, the company's Type 2 diabetes injection, also fueled revenue growth, posting $979.7 million in sales for the quarter. The drug was first approved in the U.S. in May 2022 and notched just $16 million in sales in the year-ago period. 

Investors have pinned high hopes on Mounjaro's potential mega-blockbuster trajectory beyond diabetes, with some research suggesting that it may be even more effective at reducing weight than Novo Nordisk's popular Wegovy and Ozempic injections.

Last month, Eli Lilly filed for Food and Drug Administration approval of the injection for chronic weight management.

Eli Lilly said it ""has experienced and continues to expect intermittent delays fulfilling orders of certain Mounjaro doses given significant demand.""

## Pipeline and acquisitions

Eli Lilly's stock has been on a tear in recent months, driven in part by positive trial results for its Alzheimer's drug, donanemab, and the company's progress with its promising obesity drug pipeline.

Shares of Eli Lilly are up more than 24% for the year. With a market value of roughly $431 billion, Eli Lilly is the second-largest pharmaceutical company based in the U.S. after Johnson &amp; Johnson.

The firm lowered the ratings of 10 banks by one rung, while major lenders Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, State Street, Truist Financial, Cullen/Frost Bankers and Northern Trust are now under review for a potential downgrade.

Moody’s also changed its outlook to negative for 11 banks, including Capital One, Citizens Financial and Fifth Third Bancorp.

Among the smaller lenders receiving an official ratings downgrade were M&amp;T Bank, Pinnacle Financial, BOK Financial and Webster Financial

“U.S. banks continue to contend with interest rate and asset-liability management (ALM) risks with implications for liquidity and capital, as the wind-down of unconventional monetary policy drains systemwide deposits and higher interest rates depress the value of fixed-rate assets,” Moody’s analysts Jill Cetina and Ana Arsov said in the accompanying research note.

“Meanwhile, many banks’ Q2 results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital. This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline from solid but unsustainable levels, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios.”

Regional U.S. banks were thrust into the spotlight earlier this year after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank triggered a run on deposits across the sector. The panic eventually spread to Europe and resulted in the emergency rescue of Swiss giant Credit Suisse by domestic rival UBS.

# [Stock futures fall with bank shares under pressure from Moody’s downgrade: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/07/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures retreated Tuesday as a decline in bank shares dampened investor sentiment.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked lower by 191 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.5% each.
*****
&gt; Bank shares fell broadly after Moody’s downgraded the credit rating on several banks, including M&amp;T Bank and Pinnacle Financial. The credit agency also placed Bank of N.Y. Mellon and State Street on review for a downgrade.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase traded lower in the premarket. The SPDR S&amp;P Bank ETF (KBE) slipped 2.3% in the premarket, while the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) dipped 2%.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continued. UPS shares dropped more than 5% after the delivery giant reported weaker-than-expected revenue for the second quarter. The company also lowered its full-year revenue outlook. Educational tech company Chegg popped about 23% after reporting second-quarter revenue of $183 million, beating analysts’ estimate of $177 million, per Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; The corporate earnings season has so far been better-than-expected. Roughly 86% of S&amp;P 500 stocks have reported quarterly results, and nearly 80% of them have beaten Wall Street’s expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; “The good news is that the earnings trough/recession is likely coming to an end, with earnings growth expected to accelerate over the coming quarters,” said Dylan Kremer, co-chief investment officer at Certuity. “Looking ahead, earnings projections seem a bit lofty to us relative to revenue growth estimates, particularly starting in Q1/24.”
*****
&gt; On the economic data front, traders are looking ahead to July’s consumer price index report, out Thursday. The inflation metric could put Wall Street’s belief in a soft landing to the test. Economists polled by Dow Jones are calling for a monthly increase of 0.2% in July and a year-over-year rise of 3.3%.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a strong performance Monday. The 30-stock Dow surged more than 400 points, or nearly 1.2%, for its best day since June 15. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%, and S&amp;P 500 closed higher by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 broke four-straight sessions of losses.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, August 8th, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Tuesday, August the 8th, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/07/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall with bank shares under pressure from Moody’s downgrade: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock futures retreated Tuesday as a decline in bank shares dampened investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked lower by 191 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.5% each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank shares fell broadly after Moody’s downgraded the credit rating on several banks, including M&amp;amp;T Bank and Pinnacle Financial. The credit agency also placed Bank of N.Y. Mellon and State Street on review for a downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase traded lower in the premarket. The SPDR S&amp;amp;P Bank ETF (KBE) slipped 2.3% in the premarket, while the SPDR S&amp;amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) dipped 2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings season continued. UPS shares dropped more than 5% after the delivery giant reported weaker-than-expected revenue for the second quarter. The company also lowered its full-year revenue outlook. Educational tech company Chegg popped about 23% after reporting second-quarter revenue of $183 million, beating analysts’ estimate of $177 million, per Refinitiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corporate earnings season has so far been better-than-expected. Roughly 86% of S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks have reported quarterly results, and nearly 80% of them have beaten Wall Street’s expectations, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The good news is that the earnings trough/recession is likely coming to an end, with earnings growth expected to accelerate over the coming quarters,” said Dylan Kremer, co-chief investment officer at Certuity. “Looking ahead, earnings projections seem a bit lofty to us relative to revenue growth estimates, particularly starting in Q1/24.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the economic data front, traders are looking ahead to July’s consumer price index report, out Thursday. The inflation metric could put Wall Street’s belief in a soft landing to the test. Economists polled by Dow Jones are calling for a monthly increase of 0.2% in July and a year-over-year rise of 3.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is coming off a strong performance Monday. The 30-stock Dow surged more than 400 points, or nearly 1.2%, for its best day since June 15. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%, and S&amp;amp;P 500 closed higher by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&amp;amp;P 500 broke four-straight sessions of losses.&lt;/p&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Tesla
’s chief financial officer, Zach Kirkhorn, stepped down from his position, effective Aug. 4, the automaker announced Monday morning in a regulatory filing. Tesla’s chief accounting officer Vaibhav Taneja was appointed as the new CFO and will hold both roles concurrently.

Shares of Tesla were trading down about 2.5% on the news.

Kirkhorn will stay on with Tesla through the end of the year to assist in the transition, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Kirkhorn had served as CFO since March 2019 and had worked for Tesla since 2010.

“As I shift my responsibilities to support this transition, I want to thank the talented, passionate, and hard-working employees at Tesla, who have accomplished things many thought not possible,” Kirkhorn wrote on LinkedIn.

Kirkhorn’s departure marks the second CFO replacement at Tesla in just over four years. When prior CFO Deepak Ahuja left Tesla in 2019, shares dipped as much as 4.5%.

Vaibhav Taneja, Kirkhorn’s replacement and Tesla’s former chief accounting officer, has been with the automaker since 2017.

I have a questions regarding IRA Contributions, gains and associated taxes. I read that any contributions I make are withdrawable tax-free at any time. Any gains I make in that account are withdrawable tax-free only after I have owned the account for 5 years AND after I am over 59.5 years old


Main question: are any gains non-taxable after the criteria are met? If I kept depositing 1k a year from age 30, but my account value at age 60 is 200k, I withdraw the entire 200k free of any tax? No income, capital gains, nothing?



Second scenario: I contribute 1k from age 30 to 34, so 4k total. In this time, trading stocks, options, whatever, the total value has become 8k, so a total 4k gain. Can I withdraw 4k ( my contribution) tax-free, and leave the other 4k in the account to just grow till I'm 59.5?

Now, I can't withdraw a single cent before the age of 59.5 without paying taxes - right?



And if I had to withdraw all 8k, then 4k would be tax-free, and what about that other 4k, the ""gains""? What rate are they taxed- would it be income tax bracket, or some other %?

The U.S. Federal Reserve will likely need to raise interest rates further to bring down inflation, Governor Michelle Bowman said on Saturday. Bowman said she supported the Fed’s quarter-point increase in interest rates last month, given still-high inflation, strong consumer spending, a rebound in the housing market and a labor market that is helping to feed higher prices. “I also expect that additional rate increases will likely be needed to get inflation on a path down to the FOMC’s 2 percent target,” she said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Kansas Bankers Association, referring to the Fed’s rate-setting panel, the Federal Open Market Committee.

Monetary policy is not on a “preset course,” she also said, and data will drive future decisions. “We should remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting if the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled.” Bowman has frequently expressed views that are more hawkish than some of her colleagues. In forecasts published in June, most Fed policymakers expected to end the year with the Fed policy rate at 5.6%, one quarter-point hike above the setting established at the Fed’s late-July meeting. Bowman’s use of the plural “rate increases” in her remarks on Saturday indicates she thinks the Fed will need to go higher than that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/05/feds-bowman-says-more-us-rate-hikes-likely-will-be-needed.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/05/feds-bowman-says-more-us-rate-hikes-likely-will-be-needed.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

719,stocks,"This week's casual valuation is **HelloFresh**. I've received many requests to cover it as it is one of the largest positions in my portfolio (13.5%).

In this post, I'll share everything that there's to share from my side, but please do not treat this as financial/investment advice. If you want to make any decision, please do your homework.

The post will be divided into the following segments:

* Introduction
* The business model
* Historical financial performance
* The balance sheet
* The 2025 target (provided by the management)
* Assumptions &amp; valuation
* Valuation based on assumptions different than mine

**Introduction**

For those who are not familiar, HelloFresh is a company operating in a niche market. It is a direct-to-consumers company, that delivers meal kits &amp; ready-to-eat meals.

**A meal kit** is a combination of a recipe and all the ingredients required to make the meal. Once a week, the customer can choose the recipes, and everything gets delivered in a box to their doorstep.

**A ready-to-eat-meal**, is well, pretty much the same, except there's no cooking to be done.

Other than its own brand HelloFresh, it has acquired other smaller companies in the past, such as Factor\_, Green Chef, Chef's Plate, and YouFoodz. These are companies that operate in the same industry, and the company uses its know-how to scale them up, by increasing capacity, but also expanding in other countries.

Other than selling meals, it also sells soups, desserts, bakery products, salads, etc.

A tiny portion of their revenue comes in the form of fees for including some marketing material of other companies (offering discounts for example) in the box sent to the final customer. This is not a significant portion, but the margins are 100%. Adding a couple of flyers in a box doesn't take that much space, and other companies would pay to target a certain geographical area for their products/services.

&amp;#x200B;

**The business model**

The company operates based on a pull model, meaning the first step is done by the customers, choosing the recipes, and placing the order. Between that day, and the delivery (in the Netherlands, the deadline for ordering is Wednesday, and delivery is being done during the weekend), HelloFresh:

* Orders all the ingredients
* Gets all the ingredients delivered to their fulfillment centers
* Orders are being packaged &amp; sorted for delivery

There has been a lot of investment done in automation in advanced assembly lines, so the fulfillment centers are in pretty good shape.

The capex reached its peak in 2022 and is expected to decrease every year over the next 3 years. The main reason for this is the infrastructure that is already in place as it is sufficient to support €10b in revenue (the last twelve months' revenue is €8b).

There are 7.1m customers (assuming 1 customer = 1 household), representing roughly a 2% penetration rate, comparing it against the 322m households in the countries where the company operates. A high penetration rate should not be assumed, as this is a very niche market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

The company has roughly €8b in revenue (vs. €4.3b market cap), with a gross margin of 26%. The direct costs are related to:

* Ingredients
* Packaging
* Delivery

After taking the marketing &amp; G&amp;A expenses into account, the operating margin is around 3%. So, why would I invest in a company of this kind?

I expect the margins, and the free cash flow to grow. Here's my rationale:

If you take a look at the 3 direct costs, it can be argued that **ingredients and packaging** will grow hand in hand with the more orders the company has, leading to higher gross profit, but same margins.

However, **delivery** doesn't grow at the same pace. Imagine if one of their vans needs to transport 10 packages to one neighborhood, Now, if the same van has to transport 12 packages, the cost would not increase by 20%. The van has already made the majority of the journey.

This means, **the more customers there are in a certain geographical region, the higher the margins are**. In the mature markets where the company operates, the operating margin is between **8%-10%** (in some, the operating margin is even 12%, but this is too high to use for long-term assumptions).

I am a customer of HelloFresh, this is how I got introduced to this public company. If someone is happy with the product/service, there's no additional marketing expense required to keep them satisfied. Therefore, I expect the marketing expense to decrease as % of revenue over time. The management shared the 2025 targets, and we'll come back to this.

&amp;#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

The company has almost €0.5b in cash, which is solid, with very low accounts receivable (€17m) which is expected, as the customers pay almost at the same time as the delivery. This means the company has almost no risk of not getting paid.

In addition, as there operate in order cycles, they hold very little inventory (€250m), consisting of fresh ingredients and packaging materials.

On the other side of the balance sheet, it is worth mentioning that they have around €0.7b in debt, including leases, as they lease some of the fulfillment centers in the US, Sweden, Canada, Australia, and the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

**The 2025 target**

The management shared the 2025 targets, and the summary is as follows:

* Revenue growth to €10b
* Gross profit 26% --&gt; 29%
* Marketing expense (as % of revenue) 18% --&gt; 16%
* Operating profit 3% --&gt; 8%

Today, we have a company with low profitability and high capex (to increase its capacity), and as of 2024/2025, we'll have a company with modest profitability and much lower capex. Based on my assumptions, I expect a significant increase in the free cash flow.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumptions &amp; Valuation**

However, only because the management has certain targets, doesn't mean that is exactly what is going to happen.

My assumptions are more conservative:

* **Revenue growth** of 5% for the next year, reducing to 2.5% over time (the €10b revenue target of the management is hit in 2028)
* **Operating margin** slowly improving, reaching 8% in 2027
* **A discount rate** of 8.7%

After adjusting for what is on their balance sheet, as well as the equity options outstanding, the value of HelloFresh is roughly €6b (€34.5/share).

For comparison, the company's market cap is €4.3b (€24.5/share).

Based on my assumptions, the IRR that the company offers is **12.7%.**

For those who are interested in multiples, based on my assumptions, at year 10, the terminal value is multiple of the FCF at year 10 x 17.8.

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**

Of course, the future is uncertain and my assumptions could be significantly wrong. Let's take a look at how the valuation (per share) changes if we use different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue / Operating margin|6%|8%|10%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|40% (€10.8b)|€23.0|€32.7|€41.3|
|51% (€11.6b)|€23.9|**€34.5**|€43.5|
|100% (€15.4b)|€27.7|€41.4|€53.7|

The €34.5 is the fair value based on my assumptions. If you take a look at the sensitivity, for example, the 6% operating margin column, there's not that much difference if the company grows by 40% over the next decade, or by 100% (€23.0 vs. €27.7).

However, if you take a look at the first row, the valuation changes significantly. As this is a low-margin business, one of the main tasks of the management is to expand margins.

Therefore, the main risk around the company is its margins. If the management doesn't succeed to expand the margins, the impact on the valuation is significant.

My rationale is that as the company gets more customers in the existing geographical regions, the costs per order will decrease. In addition, the reduced marketing expense (as % of revenue) and reduced capex will increase the FCF significantly over the next two years.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#39;s casual valuation is &lt;strong&gt;HelloFresh&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are not familiar, HelloFresh is a company operating in a niche market. It is a direct-to-consumers company, that delivers meal kits &amp;amp; ready-to-eat meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A meal kit&lt;/strong&gt; is a combination of a recipe and all the ingredients required to make the meal. Once a week, the customer can choose the recipes, and everything gets delivered in a box to their doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A ready-to-eat-meal&lt;/strong&gt;, is well, pretty much the same, except there&amp;#39;s no cooking to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than its own brand HelloFresh, it has acquired other smaller companies in the past, such as Factor_, Green Chef, Chef&amp;#39;s Plate, and YouFoodz. These are companies that operate in the same industry, and the company uses its know-how to scale them up, by increasing capacity, but also expanding in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than selling meals, it also sells soups, desserts, bakery products, salads, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tiny portion of their revenue comes in the form of fees for including some marketing material of other companies (offering discounts for example) in the box sent to the final customer. This is not a significant portion, but the margins are 100%. Adding a couple of flyers in a box doesn&amp;#39;t take that much space, and other companies would pay to target a certain geographical area for their products/services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The business model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Gets all the ingredients delivered to their fulfillment centers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orders are being packaged &amp;amp; sorted for delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of investment done in automation in advanced assembly lines, so the fulfillment centers are in pretty good shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capex reached its peak in 2022 and is expected to decrease every year over the next 3 years. The main reason for this is the infrastructure that is already in place as it is sufficient to support €10b in revenue (the last twelve months&amp;#39; revenue is €8b).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has roughly €8b in revenue (vs. €4.3b market cap), with a gross margin of 26%. The direct costs are related to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ingredients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 2025 target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The management shared the 2025 targets, and the summary is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue growth to €10b&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A discount rate&lt;/strong&gt; of 8.7%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for what is on their balance sheet, as well as the equity options outstanding, the value of HelloFresh is roughly €6b (€34.5/share).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the company&amp;#39;s market cap is €4.3b (€24.5/share).&lt;/p&gt;

721,stocks,"The pandemic showered Pfizer with record sales. Now the end of the crisis is dragging the drugmaker down.

Its Covid-19 vaccine and drug powered Pfizer to more than $100 billion in sales last year, the first drugmaker to break the barrier. Shares soared, as Wall Street hailed the company for its savvy, fast and ultimately lucrative pivot to taking on the virus.

But many people have moved on from the pandemic. Sales from the two products dropped so much, so rapidly they contributed to Pfizer’s overall sales falling sizably in its most recent quarter compared with the period a year earlier. The company dialed back the top end of its expectations for the full-year performance.

Shares are down 31% this year to date, a loss of more than $88 billion in market capitalization. The company’s valuation has dropped by $144 billion since its 2021 peak.

Pfizer is hitting a rough spot after its Covid-19 sales nosedived and while it waits for new drugs and recent deal-making to pay off. Adding to the straits: the loss of an estimated $17 billion in annual sales by the end of the decade, when some of the company’s biggest sellers, like arthritis treatment Xeljanz, lose patent protection. 

The New York-based company has talked up plans to increase revenue through a bevy of new drug approvals and their launches. It also has been using its Covid-19 cash to secure other products for its lineup. It predicts more than $10 billion in 2030 sales from its $43 billion proposed deal to buy cancer-drug biotech Seagen, as it leans more into cancer drugs. 

Executives also have other dials they can turn to tune up the company’s performance, such as cutting costs and some drug research programs.

Yet executing means Pfizer must overcome factors outside its control. The Federal Trade Commission is reviewing the agreement to buy Seagen, while drugs in late-stage development must pass testing and get green lights from the Food and Drug Administration.

And Pfizer’s ambitious expectations for launches of new products might be difficult to pull off in today’s tightfisted healthcare environment.

Pfizer has “gotten a lot of things over the finish line, and there’s still some more to go, but they’re asking a lot of those products to contribute in a relatively narrow time frame before year end,” Barclays analyst Carter Gould said. 

Sales of drugs from recent acquisitions, including migraine drug Nurtec and sickle-cell disease treatment Oxbryta, have been slow to accumulate, said Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger. “The market demand has been somewhat softer than expected for both of them,” he said.

The predicament is customary for big pharmaceutical companies, which regularly confront the ups and downs of patent-dependent franchises. Pfizer has plenty of experience navigating through sales drops for impotence pill Viagra, cholesterol fighter Lipitor and other erstwhile juggernauts.

Playing a role this time is Pfizer’s decision to slim down and become a growth stock. Before the pandemic hit, the drugmaker had shed slower-growing businesses, losing the cushion of their steady cash flows, to focus on higher-growth but more volatile prescription drugs.

The strategy paid off handsomely during the pandemic. Shares reached a record high of roughly $61 in December 2021 as the Omicron variant spread throughout the world and Pfizer shipped billions of Covid-19 shots. Pfizer developed the shot with Germany’s BioNTech.

The return to Earth has been abrupt. Earlier this year, Pfizer said it expects its Covid-19 vaccine to generate $13.5 billion in sales in 2023, down roughly two-thirds from last year. The company said its Paxlovid antiviral would bring in about $8 billion in sales this year, down 58% from last year. 

Sales for the products are lower this year because governments have purchased fewer contracts and the U.S. is transitioning to a commercial market. Doctors are also writing fewer Paxlovid prescriptions. 

“A key driver will be the magnitude of the next Covid wave and whether it drives people to be vaccinated at a higher rate or not,” Risinger said. “Covid fatigue and vaccine hesitancy adds additional uncertainty about what the future demand will be for Covid vaccinations.” 

Pfizer said last week, when reporting quarterly earnings, that it should have more clarity on future demand for its pandemic products by the end of the year. By then, it will have rolled out its latest Covid-19 shot through the traditional commercial market. 

Should sales fail to materialize, Pfizer is prepared to trim R&amp;D spending for Covid-19 and other disease areas, Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in an interview.  

“We are moving post-Covid,” Bourla said.

Pfizer lowered its growth-rate target for this year, citing the FDA’s decision to approve a cancer drug for a smaller patient population than the company expected and the federal government’s recommendation for a new RSV vaccine falling short of company expectations.

Recent damage from a tornado to a North Carolina manufacturing plant might also jeopardize sales, Chief Financial Officer David Denton said. 

To date this year, the FDA has approved four Pfizer medicines. The company is more than halfway through its goal of rolling out 19 new drugs or expanded uses over 18 months through the first half of 2024. 

An experimental multiple myeloma drug called elranatamab that is up for FDA approval could generate about $1 billion in sales in 2030, according to Jefferies analyst Akash Tewari.

Pfizer has plenty of experience navigating through sales drops for impotence pill Viagra, cholesterol fighter Lipitor and other erstwhile juggernauts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing a role this time is Pfizer’s decision to slim down and become a growth stock. Before the pandemic hit, the drugmaker had shed slower-growing businesses, losing the cushion of their steady cash flows, to focus on higher-growth but more volatile prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy paid off handsomely during the pandemic. Shares reached a record high of roughly $61 in December 2021 as the Omicron variant spread throughout the world and Pfizer shipped billions of Covid-19 shots. Pfizer developed the shot with Germany’s BioNTech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The return to Earth has been abrupt. Earlier this year, Pfizer said it expects its Covid-19 vaccine to generate $13.5 billion in sales in 2023, down roughly two-thirds from last year. The company said its Paxlovid antiviral would bring in about $8 billion in sales this year, down 58% from last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales for the products are lower this year because governments have purchased fewer contracts and the U.S. is transitioning to a commercial market. Doctors are also writing fewer Paxlovid prescriptions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A key driver will be the magnitude of the next Covid wave and whether it drives people to be vaccinated at a higher rate or not,” Risinger said. “Covid fatigue and vaccine hesitancy adds additional uncertainty about what the future demand will be for Covid vaccinations.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said last week, when reporting quarterly earnings, that it should have more clarity on future demand for its pandemic products by the end of the year. By then, it will have rolled out its latest Covid-19 shot through the traditional commercial market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should sales fail to materialize, Pfizer is prepared to trim R&amp;amp;D spending for Covid-19 and other disease areas, Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in an interview.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are moving post-Covid,” Bourla said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer lowered its growth-rate target for this year, citing the FDA’s decision to approve a cancer drug for a smaller patient population than the company expected and the federal government’s recommendation for a new RSV vaccine falling short of company expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent damage from a tornado to a North Carolina manufacturing plant might also jeopardize sales, Chief Financial Officer David Denton said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date this year, the FDA has approved four Pfizer medicines. The company is more than halfway through its goal of rolling out 19 new drugs or expanded uses over 18 months through the first half of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An experimental multiple myeloma drug called elranatamab that is up for FDA approval could generate about $1 billion in sales in 2030, according to Jefferies analyst Akash Tewari. &lt;/p&gt;

722,stocks,"Central Puerto (NYSE:CEPU) stands as one of Argentina's largest energy companies. They accounted for 12.7% of the total power generated by private sector generation companies in Argentina in the last twelve months ending on March 31, 2023.

In the past year, the company has faced challenges in improving its income. Despite experiencing a 20% decrease in revenue (without accounting for the 100% inflation rate) during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the previous quarter, and with expenses rising between 9% to 17%, the company managed to report a positive operating income. Notably, they had an unusually high CAPEX due to the acquisition of ""Central Costanera,"" which contributes approximately 3% of Argentina's installed capacity.We all acknowledge that the Argentine energy sector has been an unattractive investment due to the government's restrictive regulatory framework, resulting in insufficient investments to meet the country's energy demands. However, there are promising signs of potential change in this regard.  

Firstly, the outlook for Argentina's political future is highly optimistic. The recent announcements of presidential candidates from both major political parties, advocating a shift towards a free market economy and emphasizing the independence of the Argentine central bank from the treasury, have had a profound impact on the markets. As evidenced by the 30% surge in Argentine bonds in June, there is a growing positive sentiment and increased investor confidence in the potential direction of the country's economy.  

Secondly, Argentina's recent agreement with the IMF will provide the country with an additional credit of 7.5 billion dollars. This new arrangement indicates that the IMF will likely impose conditions aimed at achieving fiscal surpluses and implementing monetary tightening, with the ultimate goal of reducing inflation rates.

My main idea is that given the political shift towards a free market economy and the challenging stagflation in the Argentine economy, the new president will likely be compelled to make a 180-degree turn in economic policies. This shift may involve measures to reduce the fiscal deficit and control inflation through some form of exchange rate stabilization.

726,stocks,"**About the company**  
  
Cactus Inc. (WHD) makes and sells wellheads and pressure control equipment to the oil and gas industry. It also sells flexible piping through its FlexSteel unit. The company was founded in 2011. It currently has a market cap of $4.11 billion and pays a 0.85% dividend.   
  
**Management**  
  
The CEO, Scott Bender, is a co-founder of the company and has been CEO for its entire existence. His brother Joel is also an executive and has been with the company sincere co-founded it. Management owns about 20% of the company, so they are aligned with shareholder interests.  
  
**Segments and growth**  
  
Cactus is a critical supplier for oilfield operations. They make and install well heads for new oil wells. Their technology makes the process safer and more efficient than the competition. Once cactus installs their pressure systems they collect servicing fees for the life of the well. They also rent equipment to the E&amp;P companies. About 33% of their legacy business comes from these recurring sources and 66% from the wellhead installations.  
  
Earlier this year, Cactus acquired Flexsteel, a maker of flexible pipe. This allows them access to a tangential market and has been immediately accretive to free cash flow.  
  
Cactus has several growth tailwinds. The flex steel acquisition is still being integrated into the company. This will continue to add free cash flow to the balance sheet. US oil drillers are going strong and Cactus will keep getting revenue from their operations. Also, Cactus is developing products for new markets. They are branching into carbon sequestration too. They opened their first sequestration project in 2022 and have several more in the works. They are also making efforts to leverage Flex steel to get into the midstream market and, more importantly, into offshore drilling. The offshore drilling market is projected to grow at a 7-8% CAGR for the next decade plus, so this is a big growth opportunity for the company. They currently have limited offshore offerings.  
  
Lastly, the company authorized a $100 million buyback plan. This will benefit investors if they can continue it longer term, and based on their cash flows, this is likely.  
  
**Performance and balance sheet**  
  
WHD currently has a ROE of 21% with a five year average of 34%. Its current ROIC is 18% with a five year average of 22%. Both those averages are skewed by huge numbers in 2018 and low figures in 2020. This is reflective of the cyclical nature of the energy sector. Their 2020 ROE was around 10%, which isn’t too bad for an oil services company in a pandemic. I’d consider the company to be a good allocator of capital.   
  
The company has a solid balance sheet. Total debt is $189.81 million, which is less than 1 year of free cash flow.  This level of debt is easily manageable, even in a downturn. Much of the debt was due to their Flex steel acquisition and will be paid down.

**Risks**

Like most energy related businesses, Cactus is at the risk of the commodity cycles. If oil prices decline there will likely be less investment into wells and Cactus will see its business shrink. The fact that they stayed profitable in 2020 does illustrate the durability of the business though.   
  
**Valuation**  
  
WHD is trading at around 23x current earnings and 15x forward earnings. It has been seeing its earnings rebound consistently since the 2020 lows. Its 5 year p/e range is 6-60 (energy has been volatile). Analysts are forecasting double digit EPS growth going forward, but this is subject to energy prices. It has a PEG of 0.97. A deep recession or a decline in oil prices would definitely be bad for Cactus’ business.   
  
Morningstar has fair value at $59.15 and it has been climbing, making the stock slightly undervalued even after its recent run.  I have a fair value in the mid $50s. I don't generally share my fair value assumptions since they are, well, assumptions and I'd urge anyone interested to use their own numbers as well. The stock has been on a run recently too, so there is a risk of a pullback soon. The company will also be releasing earnings on August 7th which could cause additional volitility.  
  
If you believe that oil will be a booming market for the foreseeable future, I think that shares are well priced. Cactus is a company that is founder led and management has a large stake in its success. With high ROE and new products coming to market, I think Cactus can continue to grow.

I currently have no stake in WHD.

China CITIC Bank Corporation Limited ([0998.HK](https://0998.HK)) PB 0.25 Dividend 9.89% PE 3.11 (higher debt)

&amp;#x200B;

Is everyone expecting that a major mortgage collapse is inevitable? Are there some ratios to support such claims similarly to how there are ratios for US recessions. 

I haven't made much of a search and I am sure there are other bargains, so feel free to share them here. 

Even if there is a collapse of the housing market in China wouldn't those banks be nicely protected from bankruptcy with their great PB ratio and enough earnings to currently provide 9% p.a. in dividends? They can always reduce/remove the dividends to improve their financial position. I am not saying that their SP won't be impacted significantly (i.e. 40-60% downturn), but that they are still a solid investment for the political and financial risks. Besides is there really another political risk except war? Could CCP really privatize such major banks and risk losing many cash flow/investments coming from abroad?  If they get at risk of bankruptcy I am sure the Chinese government would bail them out, but not sure if this would help the stockholders or not.

Opendoor/Offerpad (OPEN/OPAD) there is definitely some value in iBuying I think. (iBuying is where a company buys a home to flip for profit). Zillow and Redfin ended their iBuying businesses, so obviously iBuying is a super risky, capital heavy business model. But if there’s a company that can figure out how to do it profitably then the sky is the limit.  There’s just too much bullshit in trying to sell a home with all the fees, listing it for sale, scheduling tours, etc.  There’s definitely going to be a good number of people who just want to skip the bullshit and receive a fair cash offer for their home to sell it the next day, especially people who need to sell quickly. All real estate stocks have gotten crushed because people are afraid of an imminent real estate market crash, but if we can look past the upcoming crash, and  if Opendoor or offerpad are still around and prove that iBuying is legit, then these will easily be 10x returns or more. This is a asymmetric risk play 

Redfin (RDFN)- sort of a hedge to Opendoor/ Offerpad since they ended their iBuying business. After the real estate market gets crushed and recovers, they should do well. They have the lowest fees for selling I house I think. 

Ginkgo Bioworks (DNA) - Cathy Wood’s favorite penny stock. They basically program cells for all sorts or products, vaccines, and foods. Seems like they have a bunch of partnerships. Once they engineer living cells for clients they store the cell’s design in a database or foundry to sell to other clients or build, test, and automate more organism engineering. Could be the amazon of biotech or the AWS of biological engineering. 

Matterport (MTTR) - they make those machines that take 3D scans of a building or home to make a “digital twin”. Used a lot for real estate agents selling homes which might do well after real estate demand picks up. There are other products like it, but it’s seems like the hardware/software has the best reputation. They store all the “digital twins” in a database that they could possibly monetize well someday. The “digital twins” should work well in the Metaverse as we digitally recreate the physical world.

If bitcoin/ethereum achieve even half of its mission or intended purpose in the long term then these stocks should be multi-baggers, right? 

Chargepoint/ EvGo(CHPT/EVGO): I mean don’t we need as many charging stations as possible for our electric vehicle future?  Do we really think Tesla will be the only prevalent charging station network? 

Enphase (ENPH): I mean, would any of us not install solar panels on our homes at the right price? I feel like this will fall to the $120 support level after that last earnings report but then proceed to 10x over the next decade

# **S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq tumble for four straight days, notch worst weeks since March: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/03/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slumped Friday for a fourth straight session, and notched their worst weeks since March, as traders seemed to book profits following the latest corporate earnings releases and U.S. jobs data.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.53% to finish at 4,478.03, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.36% to settle at 13,909.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 150.27 points, or 0.43%, to end at 35,065.62.
*****
&gt; All the major indexes reversed earlier gains during afternoon trading, and finished the week with losses. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P dropped about 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively, to notch their worst weeks since March. The Dow edged down 1.1%.
*****
&gt; “People this week seem more respectful of risk than they were before,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, adding that “lots of bears have been capitulating, which is often a sign that we’re closer to the end of a rally than the beginning.”
*****
&gt; After being lower on the day, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) rose to trade above 16 — pointing to investors adding volatility protection.
*****
&gt; Friday marked the final day of what’s been the busiest week of second-quarter earnings season. Amazon jumped 8.3% to its highest level in nearly a year after trouncing expectations on profit and offering positive guidance. Apple lost 4.8% after reporting lower revenue than the year-ago quarter. Both tech giants reported results late Thursday.
*****
&gt; In a sign of the boom in travel and services demand, Booking Holdings gained 7.9% on stronger-than-expected results. Amgen popped 5.5% on solid earnings and a boosted guidance.
*****
&gt; Earnings reports this season for the quarter ended in June have continued to surprise some Wall Street analysts as the expected slowdown in profits proves less than feared. About 84% of S&amp;P 500 companies have given results, with 80% surpassing Wall Street expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield also pulled back from a multimonth high to 4.04%. Its rise in recent sessions had pressured risk assets.
*****
&gt; # A cooler jobs report

&gt; Investors also received more clues into the state of the labor market with Friday’s payrolls report. The data showed 187,000 jobs added in July, less than the 200,000 expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. The unemployment rate also ticked lower to 3.5% from 3.6%.
*****
&gt; Despite the cooler headline numbers, average hourly wages pointed toward more inflation and came in ahead of expectations, rising 0.4% for the month, and 4.4% on an annualized basis. That came in slightly ahead of the 0.3% and 4.2% expected, respectively.
*****
&gt; Many on Wall Street had been eagerly awaiting the jobs report and its implications for the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking cycle. About 88% of traders expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its next meeting in September, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; But next week’s consumer price report for July could make an even greater impact on rate expectations, said Wells Fargo’s Christopher Harvey.
*****
&gt; “A hotter-than-expected print is one of the few things that could really start to change the market’s perception of the Fed, and maybe the Fed’s perception as well,” he said. “But today’s job number, I don’t think does much of anything. I think it solidifies people’s view that the Fed is done at this point.”

&gt; # The Economy is Normalizing, and That’s a Good Thing

&gt; The economy created 187,000 jobs in July, slightly softer than the 200,000 that economists expected. The last couple of months were revised lower, and so it’s always helpful to take a 3-month average, which is now running at 218,000. That’s stronger than the pre-pandemic average of 183,000.

&gt; In short, job growth remains strong. You will hear some people heralding this as the onset of a recession, but more likely this is just normalization of the economy rather than weakness. The report aligns with what we wrote in our Mid-Year 2023 Outlook, not to mention the title: “Edging Closer to Normal”.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-payrolls-601x800.png))**

&gt; The private sector created 172,000 jobs in July, up from 128,000 in June. On a sector level, job growth this year has been driven by non-cyclical areas like health care, education, and government. These sectors had lagged in the early recovery, accounting for just 13% of jobs created in 2021, and 25% in 2022. Over the first 7 months of this year, they’ve accounted for more than 50% of jobs created. July didn’t buck that trend, with health care seeing 100,000 jobs created. Government jobs were on the softer side, rising 15,000 in July versus an average of 53,000 between April and June.

&gt; The cyclical areas of the economy, especially construction, manufacturing, and leisure and hospitality, remain on the softer side, with job growth adding up to 34,000 across these three sectors. So far this year, these sectors have accounted for about 20% of job creation (not exactly “weak”), versus 36% in 2022 and 43% in 2021.

&gt; Again, the theme is normalization.

&gt; **The Best Labor Market Since the Late 1990s**

&gt; The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, not far from 50+ year lows of 3.4%. What is amazing is that the unemployment rate is slightly below where it was in June 2023, when the Fed really started to get aggressive with rate hikes.

&gt; The unemployment rate can be impacted by people leaving the labor force (technically defined as those “not looking for work”) and an aging population. I’ve discussed in prior blogs how we can get around this by looking at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e. workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population. Think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you also get around the demographic issue.

&gt; The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio remained at 80.9%. That is higher than at any point since May 2001. It was actually falling at that time, and didn’t recover until now. This is the best indication that the labor market remains very healthy, and probably in the best shape since the late 1990s.

&gt; **Bottom Line: All Signs Point to a Strong Economy**

&gt; The US economy runs on consumption, and for that you need income. The good news is that income growth appears to remain strong and looks to be running ahead of inflation. In fact, wage growth rose 0.4% in July. Monthly numbers can be volatile, but the 3-month annualized pace is 4.9%.

&gt; You combine strong wage growth with strong employment, and that translates to strong income gains across the entire economy. Over the last 3 months, overall income growth for all workers is running at a 5.3% annual pace. Meanwhile, headline inflation is running close to 2.0%. The difference between the two tells you how fast incomes are growing after adjusting for inflation, and that’s running above a 3% annual pace over the past 3 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-real-income-growth-584x800.png))** 

&gt; In my opinion, that’s your simplest measure of underlying economic growth and should tell you things are ok. Normalization is not the same as weakness.

&gt; # Sentiment Swings Higher Despite Declines

&gt; Equities have rolled over in the past week with selling hitting a pinnacle when the US government's credit rating was downgraded by Fitch on Wednesday. In spite of this, sentiment has not taken a hit. The latest survey from the AAII showed 49% of respondents reported bullish sentiment which compares to 44.9% the prior week. With nearly half of respondents reporting as optimists, bullish sentiment sits handily above its historical average of 37.5%. In fact, this week marked the ninth in a row with a bullish sentiment reading above the historical average for the longest such streak since one that ended at 13 weeks long in May 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment resulted in bearish sentiment to drop down to 21.3% which marks a 2.8 percentage point decline on the week and resulted in the lowest bearish reading since June 10, 2021 when it was 20.7%. Similar to bullish sentiment, that is the ninth week in a row with a reading below its historical average, and that is the longest streak since July 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; As a result to the increased optimism, the bull-bear spread ticked up from 20.8 last week to 27.7. That is still below the recent high of 29.9 from two weeks ago, but reiterates how investors have an elevated degree of optimism.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; Not all of the gains to bulls came from bears. Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling from 31% to 29.7%. That is in the middle of the past few years' range.

&gt; # Small Dent to Claims

&gt; Initial jobless claims have been trending lower over the past couple of months, reaching a nearly six month low of 221K last week. This week, claims rebounded rising 6K to 227K. Albeit off the strongest readings from last fall, that remains a healthy reading on joblessness.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims are at historically solid levels even if they have come off their best levels. This week, claims dropped to 205K. That is slightly above the readings from the comparable weeks of the year of the past few years (excluding 2020 and 2021 when claims were much more elevated).

&gt; At this point of the year, claims falling is normal as shown in the second chart below. The current week of the year has only seen claims rise week over week 10.7% of the time. That is the sixth most consistent week of declines of the year. Claims will continue to face seasonal tailwinds in the weeks ahead, but that will begin to reverse as summer turns to fall.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims also ticked higher in the latest week's data, reaching 1.7 million. Although higher than 1.69 million the previous week, continuing claims have much more consistently been trending lower recently, and this week's reading did in fact come in below forecasts of 1.705 million.

&gt; # Downgrades Overlooked

&gt; The bottom has dropped out for the major US indices today with the Nasdaq down over 2% and S&amp;P 500 down 1.25% as of this writing. The catalyst has been the downgrade of the United States' credit rating by Fitch from AAA to AA+ . That is the first downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt in almost twelve years and just the second ever. In the charts below, we show the performance of the S&amp;P 500, government debt, commodities, and the US dollar in the year before and the year after the 2011 downgrade.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been rallying in the months leading up to this downgrade, however, back in 2011 the S&amp;P 500 had already begun rolling over by the time S&amp;P downgraded US debt. In the wake of that downgrade, the S&amp;P 500 went on to fully erase all of the prior year's gains. Fortunately, all of those losses were quickly recouped within three months of the downgrade.

&gt; As for Treasuries and other US agency debt, performance over the past few months has been the complete opposite of 2011. Of course, the interest rate environment is also completely different now with Fed Funds 500 bps higher than it was at the time of the last downgrade. That being said, in 2011, Treasury yields were on the decline in the months headed into the downgrade, but contrary to what might have been expected, the downgrade itself did not change that trend. This time around has seen yields on US government debt moving in the opposite direction.

&gt; Bloomberg's broad commodity index has been in a similar boat with the past few months seeing a decline compared to the steady uptrend back in 2011 that was uninterrupted by the downgrade.

&gt; Finally, we would note the downgrade only acted as a longer-term turning point for the dollar. As shown in the bottom right hand chart, both this year and in 2011, the trade weighted dollar was in a downtrend in the year before the downgrade. But right as S&amp;P changed its rating, the dollar turned higher and continued to rise throughout the following year. In fact, one year out it had erased the entirety of the previous year's decline.

&gt; # Stocks Don’t Like August, Now What?

&gt; “Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.” President Dwight D. Eisenhower

&gt; Another month and more strong gains. Make that five months in a row, the S&amp;P 500 finished higher. The S&amp;P 500 is now up close to 20% on the year, just like everyone predicted.

&gt; We came into the year overweight stocks and remain there, so this run has been a lot of fun for us. But honestly, while we’ve been bullish, even we’ve been surprised by how strong markets have been.

&gt; So let’s get the bad news out of the way. The odds are increasing that stocks could finally take some type of a break. Seasonality has worked out perfectly this year. Here’s a chart we shared many, many times, and it said that some of the very best quarters out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle were the three now just behind us. Sure enough, the fourth quarter last year and the first two quarters this year were spectacular for stocks, just like history suggested. Now seasonality is saying to be open to some type of weakness, or at least a break.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-1.gif.png))**

&gt; To be clear, we do not expect major weakness. But we believe a modest pullback of approximately 5% would be perfectly normal. The S&amp;P 500 has closed higher for five consecutive months. And we’re now moving into the austere month of August. August has been a poor performer, ranking worse than only February and September since 1950 and trailing behind only September and December in the last ten years, although still averaging a positive return over both periods. Oh, and right behind August comes September, the weakest month seasonally. So, while the calendar was a tailwind, we believe it is now becoming a near-term headwind.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-2-copy.png))**

&gt; Taking another look at August, when stocks are up more than 17.5% for the year heading into this month, a breather is even more likely. We found 11 previous years (since 1950), this occurred, and August was higher only three times and down 1.1% on average. So the better the year, the worse August does, apparently.

&gt; One of the reasons we were on record for a surprise summer rally was how stocks tended to do when they had a big first month of the year. When the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 5% in January a summer rally tended to occur (check). But we take seasonal warnings as seriously as seasonal support, and now we are in a period of potential seasonal weakness, at least for the near term.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-3-copy.png))**

&gt; If stocks experience weakness over the coming months, investors may be surprised and even start projecting the catastrophe many had expected earlier in the year. But keep in mind a pullback in the next couple of months would be entirely normal seasonal behavior. In fact, it may present buying opportunities, or it may simply be a chance to stay the course and remind ourselves that most years see more than three separate 5% pullbacks. Even in a strong year, there will often be bouts of volatility, so we should be ready for it and avoid overreacting. As President Eisenhower said, start planning today.

&gt; Lastly, the S&amp;P 500 closed up five consecutive months yesterday. Historically, stocks have done quite well after similar streaks. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has been up a year later, 26 out of the past 28 times. However, the last time this happened was in June 2021, and that was followed by a drop of nearly 12%. Despite this recent example, the market’s historical strength is likely another indication of higher stock prices in the future.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-4-copy.png))**

&gt; All in all, the odds are increasing that stocks could see some seasonal weakness, but we don’t think it will be anything major. In fact, maybe a little breather could be just what the bulls need for an eventual strong end-of-year rally.

&gt; # $10 Trillion Added in Market Cap; 2023's Best and Worst Through July

&gt; The US stock market (using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy) has now seen an increase in market cap of roughly $10 trillion from its bear market low last October through the end of July 2023. As shown below, the peak market cap for the US stock market was $51.5 trillion seen on the first day of 2022. From high to low, total US market cap fell $13.7 trillion during last year's bear, but since then it has risen back up to $47.7 trillion. To get back to new all-time highs, we currently need market cap to rise by roughly $3.8 trillion.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/r3k.png))**

&gt; The average Russell 3,000 stock rose 5.74% in July. There were 813 stocks in the index that rose 10%+ in July, including 29 names that rose 50%+. Below is a table of these 50%+ gainers. Four names rose 100%: PolyMet Mining (PLM), Quantum-Si (QSI), UroGen Pharma (URGN), and Bridgebio Pharma (BBIO). Other notable names on the list of big July winners include Nikola (NKLA), Upstart (UPST), Carvana (CVNA), QuantumScape (QS), Rivian (RIVN), and Riot (RIOT). This list is made up of many of the high-fliers during the post-COVID bull that then got slaughtered during last year's bear.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/rayjuly.png))**

&gt; Through July, the average Russell 3,000 stock was up 18.1% year-to-date. Below is a list of the 35 names that are already up 200%+ on the year. Topping the list is Carvana (CVNA) with a YTD gain of 869% after gaining 77.3% in July. Back in December 2022, CVNA had fallen into the $4s, but it's now back up to the mid-$40s. Next up is Bit Digital (BTBT) with a YTD gain of 638%, followed by Cipher Mining (CIFR), IonQ (IONQ), Riot (RIOT), and Applied Digital (APLD). Similar to the list of July's biggest winners, the biggest winners YTD are many of the names that got hit the hardest last year, with many falling more than 70% during their bear market drawdowns. Carvana, for example, was actually down 98% from its all-time high when it bottomed in 2022, so even after gaining more than 800% this year, it needs to gain another 700% from here to get back to new highs.

&gt; # Key ETF Performance Through July 2023

&gt; The S&amp;P 500-tracking ETF (SPY) finished July up 3.27%, leaving it up 20.62% YTD on a total return basis. The mega-cap Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) gained only slightly more than SPY in July, but it's up more than twice as much as SPY on a YTD basis at +44.5%. The small-cap Russell 2,000 (IWM) did better than large-caps and mid-caps in July with a gain of 6.11%, but IWM is up less than large-caps on a YTD basis at +14.7%. Value and dividend stocks held up well in July and actually outperformed growth for the month, but value is lagging YTD and the DJ Dividend ETF (DVY) is actually down 0.5% on the year.

&gt; Looking at US sectors, Energy (XLE) and Financials (XLF) -- which lagged in the first half of 2023 -- did the best in July, while Health Care (XLV) and Real Estate (XLRE) were up the least. Technology (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) are currently neck and neck on a YTD basis with XLK up 43.94% through July and XLC up just three basis points more at 43.97%.

&gt; Outside of the US, we saw China (ASHR) and Israel (EIS) gain the most in July, while France (EWQ) and Spain (EWP) gained the least. YTD, it's Mexico (EWW) that's currently atop the list of country ETFs with a gain of 42.85%.

&gt; Oil (USO) gained 15%+ in July, while natural gas (UNG) fell 4.2%. Gold (GLD) saw a small monthly gain of 2.3% versus a gain of 8.6% for silver (SLV). Finally, with yields rising again during the month, Treasury ETFs were in the red. Aside from natural gas, the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) is down more than any other asset class in our matrix on a YoY basis with a total return of -12.3%.

&gt; # Dogs of the Dow for the Dog Days of Summer

&gt; With the Dow coming off of a historic winning streak last week, below we check in on performance of the index versus the Dogs of the Dow. The Dogs of a Dow is a stock-picking strategy that invests in the index members with the highest dividend yields at the end of a year holds them through the end of the next year. On a total return basis, the Dow's recent winning streak has been a benefit to both the overall index and the Dogs alike. That said, the gains to the former have brought the index up near 2022 highs on a total return basis while the Dogs of the Dow has much further to go given the overall weakness of dividend-oriented equities recently.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/073123-d1.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we show the returns of this year's Dogs of the Dow and all other individual Dow members. The Dogs of the Dow are host to some of the stocks with the worst performance this year like Verizon (VZ) and Chevron (CVX), however, there are also a couple of big winners like Intel (INTC) which has returned nearly 42% YTD or JPMorgan Chase (JPM) which has nearly posted a 20% return. However, the biggest gains in the index have come from non-Dogs. In fact, the largest gains this year have been from those with the lowest or no dividend yields at the end of last year like Boeing (BA), Salesforce (CRM), or Apple (AAPL).

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and an awesome trading week ahead r/stocks. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Friday evening to all of you here on &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt;! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 7th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq tumble for four straight days, notch worst weeks since March: Live updates - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/03/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slumped Friday for a fourth straight session, and notched their worst weeks since March, as traders seemed to book profits following the latest corporate earnings releases and U.S. jobs data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 shed 0.53% to finish at 4,478.03, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.36% to settle at 13,909.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 150.27 points, or 0.43%, to end at 35,065.62.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the major indexes reversed earlier gains during afternoon trading, and finished the week with losses. The Nasdaq and S&amp;amp;P dropped about 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively, to notch their worst weeks since March. The Dow edged down 1.1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People this week seem more respectful of risk than they were before,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, adding that “lots of bears have been capitulating, which is often a sign that we’re closer to the end of a rally than the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being lower on the day, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) rose to trade above 16 — pointing to investors adding volatility protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday marked the final day of what’s been the busiest week of second-quarter earnings season. Amazon jumped 8.3% to its highest level in nearly a year after trouncing expectations on profit and offering positive guidance. Apple lost 4.8% after reporting lower revenue than the year-ago quarter. Both tech giants reported results late Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sign of the boom in travel and services demand, Booking Holdings gained 7.9% on stronger-than-expected results. Amgen popped 5.5% on solid earnings and a boosted guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings reports this season for the quarter ended in June have continued to surprise some Wall Street analysts as the expected slowdown in profits proves less than feared. About 84% of S&amp;amp;P 500 companies have given results, with 80% surpassing Wall Street expectations, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10-year Treasury yield also pulled back from a multimonth high to 4.04%. Its rise in recent sessions had pressured risk assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;A cooler jobs report&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors also received more clues into the state of the labor market with Friday’s payrolls report. The data showed 187,000 jobs added in July, less than the 200,000 expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. The unemployment rate also ticked lower to 3.5% from 3.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the cooler headline numbers, average hourly wages pointed toward more inflation and came in ahead of expectations, rising 0.4% for the month, and 4.4% on an annualized basis. That came in slightly ahead of the 0.3% and 4.2% expected, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many on Wall Street had been eagerly awaiting the jobs report and its implications for the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking cycle. About 88% of traders expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its next meeting in September, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But next week’s consumer price report for July could make an even greater impact on rate expectations, said Wells Fargo’s Christopher Harvey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A hotter-than-expected print is one of the few things that could really start to change the market’s perception of the Fed, and maybe the Fed’s perception as well,” he said. “But today’s job number, I don’t think does much of anything. I think it solidifies people’s view that the Fed is done at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Economy is Normalizing, and That’s a Good Thing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economy created 187,000 jobs in July, slightly softer than the 200,000 that economists expected. The last couple of months were revised lower, and so it’s always helpful to take a 3-month average, which is now running at 218,000. That’s stronger than the pre-pandemic average of 183,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, job growth remains strong. You will hear some people heralding this as the onset of a recession, but more likely this is just normalization of the economy rather than weakness. The report aligns with what we wrote in our Mid-Year 2023 Outlook, not to mention the title: “Edging Closer to Normal”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-payrolls-601x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector created 172,000 jobs in July, up from 128,000 in June. On a sector level, job growth this year has been driven by non-cyclical areas like health care, education, and government. These sectors had lagged in the early recovery, accounting for just 13% of jobs created in 2021, and 25% in 2022. Over the first 7 months of this year, they’ve accounted for more than 50% of jobs created. July didn’t buck that trend, with health care seeing 100,000 jobs created. Government jobs were on the softer side, rising 15,000 in July versus an average of 53,000 between April and June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cyclical areas of the economy, especially construction, manufacturing, and leisure and hospitality, remain on the softer side, with job growth adding up to 34,000 across these three sectors. So far this year, these sectors have accounted for about 20% of job creation (not exactly “weak”), versus 36% in 2022 and 43% in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the theme is normalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Labor Market Since the Late 1990s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, not far from 50+ year lows of 3.4%. What is amazing is that the unemployment rate is slightly below where it was in June 2023, when the Fed really started to get aggressive with rate hikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate can be impacted by people leaving the labor force (technically defined as those “not looking for work”) and an aging population. I’ve discussed in prior blogs how we can get around this by looking at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e. workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population. Think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you also get around the demographic issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio remained at 80.9%. That is higher than at any point since May 2001. It was actually falling at that time, and didn’t recover until now. This is the best indication that the labor market remains very healthy, and probably in the best shape since the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-employment-population-ratio-612x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line: All Signs Point to a Strong Economy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US economy runs on consumption, and for that you need income. The good news is that income growth appears to remain strong and looks to be running ahead of inflation. In fact, wage growth rose 0.4% in July. Monthly numbers can be volatile, but the 3-month annualized pace is 4.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You combine strong wage growth with strong employment, and that translates to strong income gains across the entire economy. Over the last 3 months, overall income growth for all workers is running at a 5.3% annual pace. Meanwhile, headline inflation is running close to 2.0%. The difference between the two tells you how fast incomes are growing after adjusting for inflation, and that’s running above a 3% annual pace over the past 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-real-income-growth-584x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, that’s your simplest measure of underlying economic growth and should tell you things are ok. Normalization is not the same as weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sentiment Swings Higher Despite Declines&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equities have rolled over in the past week with selling hitting a pinnacle when the US government&amp;#39;s credit rating was downgraded by Fitch on Wednesday. In spite of this, sentiment has not taken a hit. The latest survey from the AAII showed 49% of respondents reported bullish sentiment which compares to 44.9% the prior week. With nearly half of respondents reporting as optimists, bullish sentiment sits handily above its historical average of 37.5%. In fact, this week marked the ninth in a row with a bullish sentiment reading above the historical average for the longest such streak since one that ended at 13 weeks long in May 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-1.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increase in bullish sentiment resulted in bearish sentiment to drop down to 21.3% which marks a 2.8 percentage point decline on the week and resulted in the lowest bearish reading since June 10, 2021 when it was 20.7%. Similar to bullish sentiment, that is the ninth week in a row with a reading below its historical average, and that is the longest streak since July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result to the increased optimism, the bull-bear spread ticked up from 20.8 last week to 27.7. That is still below the recent high of 29.9 from two weeks ago, but reiterates how investors have an elevated degree of optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all of the gains to bulls came from bears. Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling from 31% to 29.7%. That is in the middle of the past few years&amp;#39; range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Small Dent to Claims&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial jobless claims have been trending lower over the past couple of months, reaching a nearly six month low of 221K last week. This week, claims rebounded rising 6K to 227K. Albeit off the strongest readings from last fall, that remains a healthy reading on joblessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-Claims-1.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims are at historically solid levels even if they have come off their best levels. This week, claims dropped to 205K. That is slightly above the readings from the comparable weeks of the year of the past few years (excluding 2020 and 2021 when claims were much more elevated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point of the year, claims falling is normal as shown in the second chart below. The current week of the year has only seen claims rise week over week 10.7% of the time. That is the sixth most consistent week of declines of the year. Claims will continue to face seasonal tailwinds in the weeks ahead, but that will begin to reverse as summer turns to fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing claims also ticked higher in the latest week&amp;#39;s data, reaching 1.7 million. Although higher than 1.69 million the previous week, continuing claims have much more consistently been trending lower recently, and this week&amp;#39;s reading did in fact come in below forecasts of 1.705 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Downgrades Overlooked&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom has dropped out for the major US indices today with the Nasdaq down over 2% and S&amp;amp;P 500 down 1.25% as of this writing. The catalyst has been the downgrade of the United States&amp;#39; credit rating by Fitch from AAA to AA+ . That is the first downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt in almost twelve years and just the second ever. In the charts below, we show the performance of the S&amp;amp;P 500, government debt, commodities, and the US dollar in the year before and the year after the 2011 downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 has been rallying in the months leading up to this downgrade, however, back in 2011 the S&amp;amp;P 500 had already begun rolling over by the time S&amp;amp;P downgraded US debt. In the wake of that downgrade, the S&amp;amp;P 500 went on to fully erase all of the prior year&amp;#39;s gains. Fortunately, all of those losses were quickly recouped within three months of the downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Treasuries and other US agency debt, performance over the past few months has been the complete opposite of 2011. Of course, the interest rate environment is also completely different now with Fed Funds 500 bps higher than it was at the time of the last downgrade. That being said, in 2011, Treasury yields were on the decline in the months headed into the downgrade, but contrary to what might have been expected, the downgrade itself did not change that trend. This time around has seen yields on US government debt moving in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg&amp;#39;s broad commodity index has been in a similar boat with the past few months seeing a decline compared to the steady uptrend back in 2011 that was uninterrupted by the downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would note the downgrade only acted as a longer-term turning point for the dollar. As shown in the bottom right hand chart, both this year and in 2011, the trade weighted dollar was in a downtrend in the year before the downgrade. But right as S&amp;amp;P changed its rating, the dollar turned higher and continued to rise throughout the following year. In fact, one year out it had erased the entirety of the previous year&amp;#39;s decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stocks Don’t Like August, Now What?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.” President Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another month and more strong gains. Make that five months in a row, the S&amp;amp;P 500 finished higher. The S&amp;amp;P 500 is now up close to 20% on the year, just like everyone predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came into the year overweight stocks and remain there, so this run has been a lot of fun for us. But honestly, while we’ve been bullish, even we’ve been surprised by how strong markets have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s get the bad news out of the way. The odds are increasing that stocks could finally take some type of a break. Seasonality has worked out perfectly this year. Here’s a chart we shared many, many times, and it said that some of the very best quarters out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle were the three now just behind us. Sure enough, the fourth quarter last year and the first two quarters this year were spectacular for stocks, just like history suggested. Now seasonality is saying to be open to some type of weakness, or at least a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-1.gif.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, we do not expect major weakness. But we believe a modest pullback of approximately 5% would be perfectly normal. The S&amp;amp;P 500 has closed higher for five consecutive months. And we’re now moving into the austere month of August. August has been a poor performer, ranking worse than only February and September since 1950 and trailing behind only September and December in the last ten years, although still averaging a positive return over both periods. Oh, and right behind August comes September, the weakest month seasonally. So, while the calendar was a tailwind, we believe it is now becoming a near-term headwind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-2-copy.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking another look at August, when stocks are up more than 17.5% for the year heading into this month, a breather is even more likely. We found 11 previous years (since 1950), this occurred, and August was higher only three times and down 1.1% on average. So the better the year, the worse August does, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons we were on record for a surprise summer rally was how stocks tended to do when they had a big first month of the year. When the S&amp;amp;P 500 gained more than 5% in January a summer rally tended to occur (check). But we take seasonal warnings as seriously as seasonal support, and now we are in a period of potential seasonal weakness, at least for the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-3-copy.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If stocks experience weakness over the coming months, investors may be surprised and even start projecting the catastrophe many had expected earlier in the year. But keep in mind a pullback in the next couple of months would be entirely normal seasonal behavior. In fact, it may present buying opportunities, or it may simply be a chance to stay the course and remind ourselves that most years see more than three separate 5% pullbacks. Even in a strong year, there will often be bouts of volatility, so we should be ready for it and avoid overreacting. As President Eisenhower said, start planning today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the S&amp;amp;P 500 closed up five consecutive months yesterday. Historically, stocks have done quite well after similar streaks. In fact, the S&amp;amp;P 500 has been up a year later, 26 out of the past 28 times. However, the last time this happened was in June 2021, and that was followed by a drop of nearly 12%. Despite this recent example, the market’s historical strength is likely another indication of higher stock prices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the odds are increasing that stocks could see some seasonal weakness, but we don’t think it will be anything major. In fact, maybe a little breather could be just what the bulls need for an eventual strong end-of-year rally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;$10 Trillion Added in Market Cap; 2023&amp;#39;s Best and Worst Through July&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US stock market (using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy) has now seen an increase in market cap of roughly $10 trillion from its bear market low last October through the end of July 2023. As shown below, the peak market cap for the US stock market was $51.5 trillion seen on the first day of 2022. From high to low, total US market cap fell $13.7 trillion during last year&amp;#39;s bear, but since then it has risen back up to $47.7 trillion. To get back to new all-time highs, we currently need market cap to rise by roughly $3.8 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average Russell 3,000 stock rose 5.74% in July. There were 813 stocks in the index that rose 10%+ in July, including 29 names that rose 50%+. Below is a table of these 50%+ gainers. Four names rose 100%: PolyMet Mining (PLM), Quantum-Si (QSI), UroGen Pharma (URGN), and Bridgebio Pharma (BBIO). Other notable names on the list of big July winners include Nikola (NKLA), Upstart (UPST), Carvana (CVNA), QuantumScape (QS), Rivian (RIVN), and Riot (RIOT). This list is made up of many of the high-fliers during the post-COVID bull that then got slaughtered during last year&amp;#39;s bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through July, the average Russell 3,000 stock was up 18.1% year-to-date. Below is a list of the 35 names that are already up 200%+ on the year. Topping the list is Carvana (CVNA) with a YTD gain of 869% after gaining 77.3% in July. Back in December 2022, CVNA had fallen into the $4s, but it&amp;#39;s now back up to the mid-$40s. Next up is Bit Digital (BTBT) with a YTD gain of 638%, followed by Cipher Mining (CIFR), IonQ (IONQ), Riot (RIOT), and Applied Digital (APLD). Similar to the list of July&amp;#39;s biggest winners, the biggest winners YTD are many of the names that got hit the hardest last year, with many falling more than 70% during their bear market drawdowns. Carvana, for example, was actually down 98% from its all-time high when it bottomed in 2022, so even after gaining more than 800% this year, it needs to gain another 700% from here to get back to new highs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Key ETF Performance Through July 2023&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500-tracking ETF (SPY) finished July up 3.27%, leaving it up 20.62% YTD on a total return basis. The mega-cap Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) gained only slightly more than SPY in July, but it&amp;#39;s up more than twice as much as SPY on a YTD basis at +44.5%. The small-cap Russell 2,000 (IWM) did better than large-caps and mid-caps in July with a gain of 6.11%, but IWM is up less than large-caps on a YTD basis at +14.7%. Value and dividend stocks held up well in July and actually outperformed growth for the month, but value is lagging YTD and the DJ Dividend ETF (DVY) is actually down 0.5% on the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at US sectors, Energy (XLE) and Financials (XLF) -- which lagged in the first half of 2023 -- did the best in July, while Health Care (XLV) and Real Estate (XLRE) were up the least. Technology (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) are currently neck and neck on a YTD basis with XLK up 43.94% through July and XLC up just three basis points more at 43.97%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the US, we saw China (ASHR) and Israel (EIS) gain the most in July, while France (EWQ) and Spain (EWP) gained the least. YTD, it&amp;#39;s Mexico (EWW) that&amp;#39;s currently atop the list of country ETFs with a gain of 42.85%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil (USO) gained 15%+ in July, while natural gas (UNG) fell 4.2%. Gold (GLD) saw a small monthly gain of 2.3% versus a gain of 8.6% for silver (SLV). Finally, with yields rising again during the month, Treasury ETFs were in the red. Aside from natural gas, the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) is down more than any other asset class in our matrix on a YoY basis with a total return of -12.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dogs of the Dow for the Dog Days of Summer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Dow coming off of a historic winning streak last week, below we check in on performance of the index versus the Dogs of the Dow. The Dogs of a Dow is a stock-picking strategy that invests in the index members with the highest dividend yields at the end of a year holds them through the end of the next year. On a total return basis, the Dow&amp;#39;s recent winning streak has been a benefit to both the overall index and the Dogs alike. That said, the gains to the former have brought the index up near 2022 highs on a total return basis while the Dogs of the Dow has much further to go given the overall weakness of dividend-oriented equities recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the table below, we show the returns of this year&amp;#39;s Dogs of the Dow and all other individual Dow members. The Dogs of the Dow are host to some of the stocks with the worst performance this year like Verizon (VZ) and Chevron (CVX), however, there are also a couple of big winners like Intel (INTC) which has returned nearly 42% YTD or JPMorgan Chase (JPM) which has nearly posted a 20% return. However, the biggest gains in the index have come from non-Dogs. In fact, the largest gains this year have been from those with the lowest or no dividend yields at the end of last year like Boeing (BA), Salesforce (CRM), or Apple (AAPL).&lt;/p&gt;

# Earnings and Revenue YoY Decline

With 84% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (and 80% of the market cap roughly) having reported, the new blended earnings estimate is -5.2% YoY--one week ago, their estimate was -7.4%, so we surprised to the upside. The blended revenue estimate is +0.6% YoY. [Blended just means combine estimates of companies that haven't reported with those that have]

# Beating/Missing Earnings

&gt; Of these companies, 79% have reported actual EPS above estimates, which is above the 5-year average of 77% and above the 10-year average of 73%. [...]

&gt; In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 7.2% above estimates, which is below the 5-year average of 8.4% but above the 10-year average of 6.4%.

So 80% are beating (on average 73% do), and they are beating estimates by 7.2% on average (which is typical). Yes, analysts lowered estimates.

# Sectoral Breakdown

The year over year declines in earnings are driven entirely by 3 sectors: Energy, Materials, and Health Care. All other sectors are seeing year over year growth. Similarly, the revenue declines are only in 3 sectors: utilities, energy, materials. Notice health care missing? In fact, the top 3 sectors by revenue growth are consumer discretionary, financials, and health care. My conclusion is that healthcare's earnings decline is driven by steep margin compression. [Patents expiring? Post-Covid operations increasing costs for insurers?] While energy/materials are just seeing revenue tank and thus earnings.

Top 3 earnings sectors are Consumer discretionary, Communication Services, Industrials. Guessing thanks to AMZN, META, GOOG, CAT.

&gt;This ETF aims to outperform major US equity indices during market upswings by utilizing derivatives and minimize losses through investments in cash or cash equivalents during downward trends.

&gt;When the Fund is allocated to U.S. equity securities, it will have approximately the following daily exposures: 80% to the S&amp;P 500®, 80% to QQQ, and up to 40% to the Sector Allocation. The Fund will utilize leverage to achieve total exposure of up to 200% of the Fund’s net assets to these allocations. A Sector Allocation of less than 40% may result in the Fund having less than 200% total exposure each day.

Job growth in July was less than expected, pointing to slower growth in the U.S. economy, the Labor Department reported Friday.

Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 187,000 for the month, slightly below the Dow Jones estimate for 200,000. Though the headline number was a miss, it actually represented a modest gain from the downwardly revised 185,000 in for June.

The unemployment rate was 3.5%, against a consensus estimate that the jobless level would hold steady at 3.6%.The rate is just above the lowest level since late 1969.

Average hourly earnings, a key figure as the Federal Reserve fights inflation, rose 0.4% for the month, good for a 4.4% annual pace. Both numbers were higher than the respective estimates for 0.3% and 4.2%.

Another important figure, the labor force participation rate held at 62.6%, the fifth straight month at that level. A more encompassing unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons fell to 6.7%, down 0.2 percentage point from June. The survey of households, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed a more robust gain of 268,000.

Health care led job creation by industry, adding 63,000 jobs for the month. Other sectors contributing included social assistance (24,000), financial activities (19,000) and wholesale trade (18,000). The other services category contributed 20,000 to the total, which included 11,000 from personal and laundry services.

Leisure and hospitality, which has been a leading sector for most of the recovery in the Covid pandemic era, added just 17,000 jobs, consistent with a slowing trend after averaging gains of 67,000 a month in the first three months of 2023.

Previous months’ totals were revised lower — the June count dropped to185,000, a downward revision of 24,000, while May was cut to 281,000, down 25,000 from the previous estimate.

Even with the slowing job gains, the economy has proved resilient against a variety of challenges, particularly a series of 11 Federal Reserve interest rate hikes aimed at bringing down inflation.

Most Wall Street experts have been forecasting a recession at least for the past year, but growth has managed to stay positive as consumers keep spending and the services sector rebounds from its pandemic-related disruptions.

Gross domestic product gains have averaged 2.2% annualized for the first half of 2023, and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker of growth is pointing to a 3.9% gain for the third quarter.

However, Fed officials including Chairman Jerome Powell have warned that the full effect of the rate increases has not been felt yet. Economists worry that the Fed could over-tighten and send the economy into recession.

Inflation data of late has been moving in the right direction. However, the Fed’s preferred gauge is still showing prices rising at a 4.1% annual rate, or more than double the central bank target.

Wages have been one component of the inflation picture. Average hourly earnings had been declining, though the annual figures are somewhat distorted by comparisons to a year ago when wages were surging.

A Labor Department gauge that the Fed follows closely showed compensation costs rising at a 4.5% 12-month rate through the second quarter. That level is not consistent with the Fed’s inflation target.

At the same time, recession fears on Wall Street appear to be ebbing. Goldman Sachs has been slowly reducing its probability for a contraction, and Bank of America this week said it now thinks the U.S. could avoid a recession completely.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/04/jobs-report-july-2023-187000-jobs-in-july.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/04/jobs-report-july-2023-187000-jobs-in-july.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important figure, the labor force participation rate held at 62.6%, the fifth straight month at that level. A more encompassing unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons fell to 6.7%, down 0.2 percentage point from June. The survey of households, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed a more robust gain of 268,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health care led job creation by industry, adding 63,000 jobs for the month. Other sectors contributing included social assistance (24,000), financial activities (19,000) and wholesale trade (18,000). The other services category contributed 20,000 to the total, which included 11,000 from personal and laundry services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leisure and hospitality, which has been a leading sector for most of the recovery in the Covid pandemic era, added just 17,000 jobs, consistent with a slowing trend after averaging gains of 67,000 a month in the first three months of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous months’ totals were revised lower — the June count dropped to185,000, a downward revision of 24,000, while May was cut to 281,000, down 25,000 from the previous estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the slowing job gains, the economy has proved resilient against a variety of challenges, particularly a series of 11 Federal Reserve interest rate hikes aimed at bringing down inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Wall Street experts have been forecasting a recession at least for the past year, but growth has managed to stay positive as consumers keep spending and the services sector rebounds from its pandemic-related disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product gains have averaged 2.2% annualized for the first half of 2023, and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker of growth is pointing to a 3.9% gain for the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Fed officials including Chairman Jerome Powell have warned that the full effect of the rate increases has not been felt yet. Economists worry that the Fed could over-tighten and send the economy into recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation data of late has been moving in the right direction. However, the Fed’s preferred gauge is still showing prices rising at a 4.1% annual rate, or more than double the central bank target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wages have been one component of the inflation picture. Average hourly earnings had been declining, though the annual figures are somewhat distorted by comparisons to a year ago when wages were surging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Labor Department gauge that the Fed follows closely showed compensation costs rising at a 4.5% 12-month rate through the second quarter. That level is not consistent with the Fed’s inflation target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, recession fears on Wall Street appear to be ebbing. Goldman Sachs has been slowly reducing its probability for a contraction, and Bank of America this week said it now thinks the U.S. could avoid a recession completely.&lt;/p&gt;

-----------------

**Sales**

Last time I lowered my bear case for 2023 to 1.7M, with 2.15M sales expected and 2.4M in the bull case. With 889K cars sold in H1 and the announced retooling for the Model 3 refresh, I expect them to comfortably exceed my bear case, but believe the bull case needs to lowered to 2.2M for an expected amount of sales of 1.95M for the full year. With the slightly slower ramp in Texas and Berlin, the slower than expected rollout of the Cybertruck and Mexico only coming online by the end of 2024 at the earliest, I will also lower the bull cases for 2024 and 2025 from 3.4M and 4.8M respectively:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|1,800,000|2,200,000|
|**2024**|2,400,000|3,000,000|
|**2025**|3,000,000|4,400,000|

**ASP**

I expected Tesla to decrease ASPs from $54,385 to ~$51K in 2023. With ASPs of $46,379 in H1, and although I expect ASPs to be higher in H2, I will also lower my expectations here to $47K.

I then expect ASPs to increase to $49K in 2024 and then start to decline with the introduction of the compact car, starting with $48K in 2025.

**Revenue**

Based on the ASPs and delivery numbers, the new expected automotive revenues would come down to:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|$85B|$103B|
|**2024**|$118B|$144B|
|**2025**|$144B|$211B|

As for non-automotive revenue, I will leave my expectations unchanged:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|$16B|$24B|
|**2024**|$22B|$40B|
|**2025**|$30B|$60B|

**Operating Margin**

Despite IRA battery credits (starting in March), cheaper commodity prices, increasing economies of scale (especially in Berlin and Texas), operating margin came out significantly lower than I expected at ~10.5%. I will therefor lower my margin expectations for both the bear and bull cases.

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|8%|13%|
|**2024**|10%|16%|
|**2025**|12%|20%|

**Net Income**

Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|$8.1B|$16.5B|
|**2024**|$14.0B|$29.4B|
|**2025**|$20.9B|$54.2B|

**P/E**

After the incredible gains this year so far, the current $822B market cap divided by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|101|50|
|**2024**|59|28|
|**2025**|39|15|

**PEG**

This would translate into the following PEG ratings:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|N/A|1.61|
|**2024**|0.72|0.36|
|**2025**|0.79|0.18|

------------------------------

**The conclusion**

It was obvious to anyone able to do a basic financial analysis that Tesla was oversold at $108, but I heavily underestimated the effects rising interest rates would have on Tesla's ASPs and by extension margins. While Tesla looks set to easily maintain their target growth of 50% on annual unit sales, their revenues will grow at a lower pace and net income will even be largely flat this year before resuming growth.

Despite all that and the increase in stock price since my last analysis, the PE and PEG ratios show Tesla is still undervalued in the long term. Assuming growth would flatten to ~30% after 2025, Tesla would still need to grow at least 2x for the valuation to be in line with other big tech companies. That said, the opportunity has come down a very large amount since my last evaluation and although I disagree, there is now a reasonable argument to be made that Tesla is no longer a no-brainer investment that every long term investor should have in their portfolio.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past I&amp;#39;ve made multiple posts on Tesla&amp;#39;s valuation (&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10sk1gh/on_teslas_valuation_part_4/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

&lt;p&gt;Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you&amp;#39;re holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.&lt;/p&gt;

755,stocks,"The United Auto Workers union is pressing the Detroit car companies to give its factory workers a 40% pay hike in the next labor contract, an increase that would be the largest in recent memory.

The union conveyed this demand to the automakers this week, along with a list of other items it plans to push for at the bargaining table.

The UAW is negotiating new four-year labor agreements for about 150,000 hourly workers at General Motors GM -1.26%decrease; red down pointing triangle, Ford Motor F 0.46%increase; green up pointing triangle and Jeep-maker Stellantis STLA -0.51%decrease; red down pointing triangle.

Currently, unionized factory workers at the Detroit car companies start at about $18 an hour. The top wage, achieved over a period of years, is about $32 an hour.

The 40% pay hike would be a general increase over the life of the next four-year contract. It would be broken up into a 20% increase upon the contract’s ratification, and four additional 5% wage increases given each year, according to a person familiar with the matter. 

A UAW spokesperson said that during the current contract, the average CEO salary at the Detroit car companies has increased 40%. “We believe UAW members deserve the same if not more.”

UAW President Shawn Fain has already taken an aggressive stance with the automakers, pledging to take a different tack than past UAW leaders and make significant gains for members, particularly on wages and benefits lost in previous rounds of talks.

In a speech to members Tuesday, he vowed to secure double-digit pay increases for members, without specifying an exact percentage.

He also outlined a list of 10 demands that he plans to bring to automakers, including the right to strike over plant closures, the re-establishment of some retiree benefits and a defined pension plan for all workers.

“Yes, we’re demanding double-digit pay raises,” Fain said during the address, which was broadcast via a Facebook livestream event.

Wages are typically a focus during bargaining between the UAW and the car companies, but this year, they have taken on greater prominence, following a period of high inflation. The union is also demanding a return of cost-of-living adjustments and other benefits given up in previous negotiations to help the car companies survive financially.

Still, a 40% pay increase is unusually large, compared with previous contracts. In the last round of talks, which concluded in late 2019, the union secured two sets of 3% increases over the life of the contract, along with lump-sum payments.

The car companies have historically resisted big pay increases, preferring to instead offer workers bonuses and other one-time payments that don’t add to their fixed costs.

Fain, a reform-minded leader elected to lead the 87-year-old union earlier this year, has taken a more militant tone in his dealings with the automakers and has made clear he is willing to strike.

He has argued that all three automakers are coming off a period of robust profits and that it is time for workers to share in the success.

GM said it plans to increase wages for workers, but that the union’s demands as they currently stand would threaten the company’s ability to support its hourly workers long-term.

Ford said it looks forward to working with the UAW, while Stellantis said it had a productive meeting Tuesday with the UAW leader and it is reviewing the union’s demands.

Along with higher wages, the UAW is also seeking greater job security for its members, particularly as the auto industry transitions away from the gasoline vehicles that have long supported factory jobs to building a new generation of electric vehicles.

Some auto executives say battery-powered vehicles require fewer workers to assemble than traditional gas-engine cars, and jobs for those who work at engine and transmission plants are at risk in a future that is more focused on EVs.

Ford, GM and Stellantis have all funneled billions of dollars into building new electric-vehicle plants and battery-making facilities in a collective bet that the technology will attract new customers.

For their part, they want more flexibility from the union to navigate this shift and reassign workers to new areas that support their long-term objectives on EVs.

Hard to talk about ideas here bc imo small caps would provide the best asymmetry if a war doesn’t happen. Companies with mining claims to big deposits could be big winners if there is a war bc it doesn’t matter what happens above ground as long as you don’t get nationalized: the metal stays in the ground unmolested (See Rick Rule and the Friedlands investing in Ivanhoe the copper mining company in the Congo in the middle of a war). But it could be  bullish oil and a geopolitical event with massive repercussions. Looking at the map, so many African countries that could be involved do produce oil. 

My guess and hope though is that there will be massive FUD coming out overnight in Africa, I buy certain stocks on Friday, and ECOWAS backs down bc even Nigeria shouldn’t want to fight wars on multiple fronts and Islamic militants at the same time.

**Background**

Confluent, founded in 2014 by the original creators of Apache Kafka, has become an integral part of the modern data stack.

Confluent differentiates itself with a cloud-native solution that reimagines Kafka for the cloud. It provides a complete package for developers to build next-generation applications securely.

Moreover, Confluent is designed to be present wherever its customers need it.

Their go-to-market strategy is product-led, which allows customers to get hands-on with the product early on, delivering faster time-to-value.

The model is also consumption-oriented, with customer health and actual usage being primary indicators of success.

**Financial Highlights:**

774,stocks,"The company’s DTC division reported $410 million in licensing revenue, more than triple last year’s sales, after offering shows like “Westworld” to rivals

Revenue from licensing HBO content buoyed Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming business in the second quarter, the company revealed in its earnings report Thursday. The sales helped significantly narrow its loss and appeared to be playing a big part in the company’s promise for its U.S. direct-t0-consumer business to turn a profit in 2023.

The media giant reported $2.73 billion in revenue in its DTC segment, which launched its Max service during the quarter. That was a 37% leap from last year’s second quarter, and represented about 26% of the company’s total revenue for the period. The segment swung to a $3 million EBITDA loss for the second quarter after reporting $50 million in positive EBITDA in the first quarter.

Content licensing revenue at $410 million revenue rose notably, more than tripling the $132 million reported in the same quarter last year, suggesting that the company would have had a far more significant loss without those fees.

The growth in licensing reflects a surprising move in recent months toward offering HBO shows like “Westworld” to free, ad-supported streaming TV services like Amazon’s Freevee and the Roku Channel. Warner Bros. Discovery also licensed HBO shows including “Insecure” to Netflix.

CEO David Zaslav said on a call with analysts Thursday that it would seek to do deals on a “co-exclusive” basis, meaning the licensed shows would also be available to Max subscribers.

Distribution revenue of $2.19 billion made up the bulk of the division’s total, including traditional HBO subscriptions, Max and HBO Max subscriptions, and Amazon Prime Video Channels revenue. Advertising revenue jumped 26% to $121 million, also mainly driven by subscriber growth. Total DTC subscribers fell by 1.8 million in the quarter to 95.8 million.

Zaslav told analysts the company’s deep content library “offers a wealth of opportunity in terms of feeding our own platforms, as well as others.”

“It’s a mainstay of our business to create great content and window width, through creating value in each window,” he said. “And as you would expect a lot of analysis and strategic discussion goes into these decisions. In some cases, we’ll want to keep premium content exclusively on our platform for a very long time. In other cases, we may sell it to third parties, and we don’t lose anything by growing the pie.”

“The fact is licensing some library content to others VOD platforms like Netflix or Amazon as part of a co-exclusive agreement is just smart business,” Zaslav said. “We’re expanding our audience, while maximizing the value of the asset and providing more revenue streams. And that is our job, to optimize the windowing to get the best possible return on investment.”

Warner Bros Discovery also inked deals with Roku and Tubi to license 2,000 hours of content and launch a series of channels in January. It also plans to introduce its own FAST service this year.

Later in the call, the CEO noted that if the Hollywood strikes continue, “there may be more demand” for WBD content.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s DTC division reported $410 million in licensing revenue, more than triple last year’s sales, after offering shows like “Westworld” to rivals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue from licensing HBO content buoyed Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming business in the second quarter, the company revealed in its earnings report Thursday. The sales helped significantly narrow its loss and appeared to be playing a big part in the company’s promise for its U.S. direct-t0-consumer business to turn a profit in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media giant reported $2.73 billion in revenue in its DTC segment, which launched its Max service during the quarter. That was a 37% leap from last year’s second quarter, and represented about 26% of the company’s total revenue for the period. The segment swung to a $3 million EBITDA loss for the second quarter after reporting $50 million in positive EBITDA in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content licensing revenue at $410 million revenue rose notably, more than tripling the $132 million reported in the same quarter last year, suggesting that the company would have had a far more significant loss without those fees.&lt;/p&gt;

Get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in business, from Wall Street to Silicon Valley — delivered daily.

The founder of a key Apple supplier warned of disaster on Wall Street should a war break out over Taiwan.

""If a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, it wouldn't take a month or even an hour, but just 10 seconds for the Wall Street stock market to collapse,"" Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou wrote on Facebook on Wednesday, according to an Insider translation. His post appears to have been deleted by Thursday morning, although a cached copy of the post remains.

Gou, the 72-year-old founder of the contract manufacturing giant Foxconn, wrote the post after meeting New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman on the same day.

He said he told Friedman that Taiwan's role in the global economy is far more important than that of Ukraine, which is now embroiled in a war with Russia. China claims self-ruled Taiwan — the world's top chip supplier — as its territory and has been ramping up military drills around the island.

Gou added Taiwan may be able to hold out in a war for three months, but the impact on the world's economy and financial markets would be huge and immediate.

Gou founded Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, in 1974. He is worth nearly $7.2 billion, with a substantial portion of his wealth derived from a 12.6% stake in the publicly traded division of Foxconn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The tycoon's comments about geopolitical tensions over the Taiwan Strait come amid speculation over his political ambitions.

The business magnate stepped down as Foxconn's chairman in 2019 in a bid to run for Taiwan's presidency, but dropped out of the race after he failed to win the nomination of KMT, Taiwan's main opposition party. He tried again this year, but again failed to win the party's nomination.

Some analysts think Gou may still make a run for the island's top job, the South China Morning Post reported on July 18.

Gou did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider sent to his verified Instagram account.

The Taiwan presidential election is scheduled to take place on January 13, 2024.

*****
&gt; Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.
*****
&gt; Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.
*****
&gt; “Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”
*****
&gt; In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Thursday, August 3rd, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Thursday, August the 3rd, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall after U.S. downgrade spurs a sell-off, traders scrutinize latest earnings: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures tied to the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

# [Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”
*****
&gt; A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.
*****
&gt; “I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.
*****
&gt; CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CVS Health&lt;/strong&gt; — Shares of the retail pharmacy giant rose 1.8% premarket after the company posted strong earnings and revenue for the second quarter. CVS reported earnings of $2.21 per share on revenue of $88.9 billion. Wall Street analysts expected $2.11 per share on earnings of $86.5 billion, according to Refinitiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norwegian Cruise Line&lt;/strong&gt; — The stock fell 3.2% in premarket trading after the company posted its earnings results on Tuesday, which indicated weaker-than-expected guidance for the third quarter. The cruise ship operator topped Wall Street’s estimates, however. On Wednesday, Susquehanna downgraded its rating on Norwegian shares to neutral from positive. It maintained its price target of $17, which suggests a 12.4% downside from Tuesday’s close.&lt;/p&gt;

The company also reported earnings per share of 7 cents, surpassing Wall Street’s estimate of 2 cents. Canaccord Genuity analyst David Hynes upgraded the stock to buy from hold and increased his price target to $25 from $15, citing Freshworks’ second-quarter operating margins and improved marketing and sales efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

The company reported $1 in adjusted earnings per share on $9.17 billion of revenue. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv were looking for 95 cents on earnings per share but $9.29 billion of revenue.

798,stocks,"Apple is expected to witness a decline in iPhone sales during the April-June quarter, attributed to cautious consumer behaviour in a slow economy as the launch of a new model is anticipated. As the tech giant prepares to release its earnings report, analysts emphasise the significance of revealing its utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost growth.

Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv.
Specifically, iPhone sales are anticipated to have declined by over 2% during this period, based on a survey of 24 analysts conducted by Visible Alpha. This contrasts with a nearly 3% increase in sales during the same quarter last year and a 1.5% rise in the preceding quarter (January-March).

The upcoming quarterly report may serve as a deviation from the positive earnings trend observed in other prominent tech companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Microsoft. These companies have demonstrated resilience in their cloud-based operations and have witnessed a surge in digital ad sales.
""Apple is not immune to general macroeconomic trends and will continue to set the pace (for the smartphone industry) for quite some time,"" Reuters quoted Bob O'Donnell, founder of TECHnalysis Research, as saying.
In September, analysts anticipate the unveiling of the much-anticipated iPhone 15, which could feature the widely accepted USB-C port on certain models. This development may provide a slight boost to iPhone sales during the July-September quarter, according to market experts, who have differing opinions on the overall performance during this period.

Notably, Apple has a tradition of not providing quarterly outlooks. However, industry analysts speculate that the tech giant might shed light on its utilisation of AI to enhance the upcoming product lineup, offering insights into the company's innovative approach.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is expected to witness a decline in iPhone sales during the April-June quarter, attributed to cautious consumer behaviour in a slow economy as the launch of a new model is anticipated.

Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA on Tuesday, pointing to “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,” as well as a growing general debt burden.

Back in May, the agency placed the nation’s AAA rating on negative watch, blaming the debt ceiling fight. At the time, lawmakers in Washington butted heads over an agreement that would keep the federal government from running out of money. President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill on June 2, just days away from the “X-date” on June 5.

The country’s recent debt limit feud was mentioned again in the downgrade.

“In Fitch’s view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025,” the ratings agency said.

“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” Fitch said.

The agency also highlighted the rising general government deficit, which it anticipates will rise to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. “Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending (15% of total federal spending) as agreed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act offer only a modest improvement to the medium-term fiscal outlook,” Fitch said.

The agency also noted that a combination of tightening credit conditions, weakening business investment and a slowdown in consumption could lead the economy into a “mild” recession in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of next year.

This isn’t the first time a rating agency has downgraded the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2011 after Washington managed to avoid a default. At the time, the agency highlighted political risk as part of its reasoning.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The corporation is anticipated to keep growing its revenues and operating well in the years to come, according to this optimistic prognosis.

This approach is based on personalising the travel experience for each consumer utilising data and technology. According to each person's interests, hotels and activities are suggested, and travel schedules are updated in real time.  
There are some risks involved with investing in BKNG because of their business style. Being a business that focuses on travel, BKNG's success is closely correlated with that of the travel sector. Travel spending may decline during economic downturns, which could have an effect on BKNG's operations. While I still believe in the travel sector's long-term promise, I also recognise that it is vulnerable to unanticipated occurrences like the COVID-19 pandemic, which might once again cause travel to be disrupted.  
Despite these dangers, a number of factors are driving future expansion. Since a few years ago, BKNG has made significant investments in AI technology, further demonstrating their dedication to provide consumers with trips that are more connected and personalised. By using AI to analyse information in several languages and provide personalised recommendations, BKNG hopes to improve relationships with customers and partners.   
While other BKNG brands are working to incorporate this technology into their own offers, others, like KAYAK and OpenTable, are actively experimenting with generative AI plug-ins. BKNG is well-positioned to create an engaging and distinctive booking experience, customised to match the various demands of its consumers, thanks to a solid AI base. By utilising AI, I think BKNG will continue to lead the travel sector, constantly enhancing its offerings to give clients the greatest experience possible while encouraging long-term, significant shareholder development.

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street’s busiest earnings week continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.
*****
&gt; Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.
*****
&gt; More than 160 S&amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.
*****
&gt; To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.
*****
&gt; “We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”
*****
&gt; He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.
*****
&gt; “As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.
*****
&gt; Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.
[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html""&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 over ___ YTD:

- 20% YTD: 128
- 30% YTD: 75
- 40% YTD: 47
- 50% YTD: 27
- 60% YTD: 15

About 172 stocks have a possibly negative YTD price return (again, excluding dividends). 328 are positive YTD.

Upshot: No, this is not a rally being driven by 7 stocks anymore. All sectors are starting to catch a bid, especially ones beaten down in 2023 like energy and financials. Even as Europe and China teeter on recession, we're seeing international stocks also rally.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still think this is an &amp;#39;isolated&amp;#39;, low-breadth rally?&lt;/p&gt;

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks with Tesla Inc., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and other automakers about supplying them with lithium as the oil giant works to build a business around the crucial battery metal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Exxon is one of several oil and gas companies seeking to expand into lithium production to take advantage of surging demand for use in electric-vehicle batteries, and as a way of diversifying beyond fossil fuels. The talks with potential customers are still early stage, and the company has yet to lay out its plans for potential lithium operations. However, the discussions are the latest sign of Exxon’s growing interest in the lithium business.

The company has also had conversations with battery giants Samsung and SK On Co., the people said, asking not to be named because the information is private. Exxon, SK On and Volkswagen declined to comment. Tesla, Ford and Samsung didn’t reply to messages seeking comment.

The rapid global roll out of electric vehicles has raised the risk of bottlenecks and shortages for key battery materials like lithium, sparking a rush to invest in and secure supply. The world will need nearly 60 new lithium mines and plants to feed the growing demand for the shift away from fossil fuels, according to researcher Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, and more lithium will be required in 2030 than was mined between 2015 and 2022.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/exxon-in-talks-with-tesla-ford-volkswagen-on-supplying-lithium?leadSource=uverify%20wall""&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/exxon-in-talks-with-tesla-ford-volkswagen-on-supplying-lithium?leadSource=uverify%20wall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I understand raising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, encourages savings and makes lending harder, hence discouraging inflation. Cool


But they keep saying that should also make unemployment go up. This part I don't get; if it is costlier to live because of inflation, people will come to work and unemployment stays down. For unemployment to go up, I would assume ( based on these general logics ) that once inflation cools, the unemployment rate may increase as people who have saved up enough can be unemployed, or whatever reason just be unemployed.



Finally, I assume these rates have other things factored in- like the fact the new young people join the workforce every year. And, that since student loan payments were paused, and the average American doesn't just reduce spending, but increases their credit usage more ( when inflation strikes )

834,stocks,"Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.

More than 1 million Netflix accounts and around 800,000 Disney+ subscribers in the U.S. are on ad-supported tiers, according to Ampere, representing nearly 2% of each service’s total subscriber base. The firm estimates that more than 90% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad-supported tier, representing around 45 million subscriptions.

Prior to the launch of Max, Discovery+ had somewhere in the region of 10 million ad-supported accounts, while HBO Max had around 2 million, Ampere said. It added that Peacock has more than 30 million ad-supported subscribers, the most of any new U.S. OTT service, while Paramount+ has more than 25 million ad-supported subscribers in the U.S.

Ampere believes that hybrid services are “an increasingly important element of streaming service monetization, and hybrid tiers often generate more revenue per subscription than their ad-free counterparts.” It also says that the tiers “represent a way for consumers to maintain a wider array of subscriptions while economic times remain tough.”

Ampere’s latest research comes as earnings season for the major studios is in full swing.

Netflix, which recently eliminated its basic ad-free plan in the United States as it expands its password sharing crackdown, added 5.9 million paid subscribers during the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 238.4 million globally. During its upfront presentation to advertisers in May, Netflix reported that the ad tier had nearly 5 million monthly active users.

Meanwhile, NBCUniversal parent Comcast reported that Peacock had a total of 24 million paid subscribers. The streaming service, which dropped its free tier for new users in January, recently said it would bump up the price for its Premium and Premium Plus tiers to $5.99 and $11.99, respectively, which will take effect on Aug. 17. Due to certain streaming rights and contracts with content providers, some Peacock content still has ads.

Next up on the earnings docket will be Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its Max rebrand on May 23 — which offers a $9.99 per month Max Ad Lite tier, $15.99 per month Max Ad Free tier and $19.99 per month Max Ultimate Ad Free tier.

Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).

The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.

The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.

At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.

BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.

When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.

In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.

Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.

“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.

**Galloping run**

The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.

”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.

A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).

”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.

In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.

”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.

The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”

**Strategic role**

The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.

Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.

BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.

For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.

Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.

**Tightrope**

Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.

The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.

”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.

Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.

The company released its second-quarter financial results on Thursday. The U.S.-based automaker's EV division, called ""Ford Model e,"" has lost $1.8 billion so far this year, according to Fortune.

The projected $4.5 billion loss is over twice as much as Model e's $2.1 billion loss in 2022. The company recently announced that the price of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks will be reduced due to cheaper raw battery materials.

The company touted that its low EV prices ""establish[es] leadership ahead of industry’s next-generation EVs"" and that the Ford Model e's revenue is up 39%. Ford is also expected to produce 600,000 EVs per year by 2024.

Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by $2.7 billion, up 26% during the second quarter to $12.7 billion at quarterend, and over 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are from direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the second quarter, the median FICO score was 747. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans. Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. SoFi Bank, N.A. generated $63.1 million of GAAP net income at a 17% margin.”

SoFi continues to thrive in this macro environment:

* Galileo, Technisys, and bank charter form the pillars for SoFi to become ""The AWS of Fintech""
* The acquisition of Wyndham Capital on April 3rd completes the three arms of lending under one umbrella. This cut off the middleman fee and maximizes profitability for the most lucrative segment of SoFi's businesses.
* The wide diversity of SoFi business allows it to thrive in any macro environment.
* SoFi's Savings with direct deposit APY of 4.4% gives an extra push for deposit growth in subsequent quarters.

Let's say a stock is $10.00, and you buy 100 shares. You now sell 1 contract (100 shares) at a strike price of $12.00 for $0.50 each ($50 contract).

Am I understanding how selling covered calls work, in that the following are the possible outcomes?

1. **Share price rises to strike price ($12)** \- You make $200.00 from the stock increasing, plus $50 for the sale of the contract. You are obligated to sell 100 shares for $12.00 each to the buyer. Your net profit is $250.00.
2. **Price goes way up, (example, share price increase to $50.00)** \- You make $200.00 from the stock increasing, but you don't profit any further than your strike price. Also, $5 for the sale of the contract. You are obligated to sell your 100 shares for $12.00 each to the buyer. Your net profit is $250.00.
3. **Price goes down (example, share price decrease to $8.00)** \- You lose $200 from the stock decreasing. You gain $50.00 from the sale of the contract. Net loss - $150
