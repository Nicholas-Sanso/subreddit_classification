I decided to post here because I'm anxious, scared, and excited at the same time because I finally saved up some money and invested it for the first time.  I quit drinking beer and buying useless crap, and saved up (don't laugh) $1,000 dollars and had it sitting there in a credit union with pennies for interest and I didn't like that.  

I'm really kicking myself for not doing this when I was younger.  I remember when I was in my mid 20's ""this close"" to making a brokerage account and getting started, and I never did it.  Did this scare any of you the first time you got in to trading?  

The first share I bought was 1 full share in the Vanguard VGT ETF.  I know it sounds dumb, but it was pretty scary and exciting at the same time.  My position is focusing 80% ETFs and sprinkle in some individual stocks to play around with.  

My primary goal is dividends and compound reinvesting, in the hopes that I can have a nice-ish passive income 20-30 years from now.  I'm wondering what you guys think of my current positions:

**ETFs:** VGT, VONG, VTI, SCHD, and SCHG

**Stocks** *(I bought fractions of these)*:  AAPL, AMZN, HD, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, O, RTX, WM, WMT

That was my attempt of diversifying.  I have been reading until my eyes bleed, and I really have no idea if what I'm doing is considered smart or not.  But for the first time, checking my portfolio today.. seeing I'm up 1.24% with everything in green (short of stupid Wal\*Mart)...  

I'm up a whopping $10!  And I think that's pretty cool!!!  Now how in the hell do I make that **bajillions**?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

&lt;p&gt;Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you&amp;#39;re holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.&lt;/p&gt;

# INTRODUCTION:

  
MCD's golden arches are famous worldwide, it's precisely this strong goodwill that allows their business to remain attractive to franchisees for so long. The consistent quality of each MCD store regardless of where it is on earth, the large cost advantage due to how large the franchise has become and Quality of franchisee give MCD strong cash flows. However, MCD might be overly hyped by investors who assumes that the firm can just keep opening stores regardless of the macro environment which is not true.  
**INVESTMENT THESIS 1:**  
*Strong Quality Control (QC)*  
MCD has a strong QC that many other fast food brands are unable to replicate. From the ingredients that they receive from suppliers (Fries, Cooking Oil, Nuggets etc.) to the training procedure (Timing to cook, how to maintain freshness, stringent training etc.) ([SOURCE](https://www.franchisedirect.com/information/markettrendsfactsaboutfranchising/thesuccessofmcdonalds/8/1111/#:~:text=Consistency%2C%20of%20course%2C%20is%20vital,decision%20on%20where%20to%20eat)). MCD has consistently produced quality products to its customers, this consistent quality is something customers are used to throughout their time with MCD allowing MCD to build strong brand goodwill. Furthermore, for other fast food chains to start their QC process now, it will be an uphill battle as there needs to be an overseer on what quality should be the standard and how they should go about fixing the quality. Strong QC also means that the experience in every MCD regardless of location will be consistent, allowing every MCD across the world to tap into MCD’s strong global goodwill.  
MCD has a Performance and Customer Excellence program, also known as PACE. PACE is a program by MCD to help consult poorly run franchises ensuring that standards are met.  
**INVESTMENT THESIS 2:**  
*Cost Advantage*  
There are 40,000 MCD stores globally compared to 50,000+ YUM Brand stores (KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell). Although YUM Brand has a higher store count, most of these brands use conflicting ingredients e.g. KFC uses buns for burgers whereas Pizza Hut doesn't use buns. So the actual economy of scale enjoyed by MCD is higher compared to other fast foods.  
To illustrate, as of FY22 MCD’s Franchise Expense as a %Revenue is 10.1% only as compared to YUM’s 26.2%  
**INVESTMENT THESIS 3:**  
*Franchisee Requirement*  
MCD is a big enough brand to be stringent in their franchisee selection, high initial investment ([SOURCE](https://www.franchisedirect.com/information/howmuchdoesitcosttoopenafastfoodfranchiseintheunitedstates/)) and large time commitment through Mcdonald University. Meaning only high quality franchisees get to run MCD. In fact, MCD is one of the most popular franchise restaurants ([SOURCE](https://americasbestfranchises.com/blog/the-biggest-franchises-in-the-world-in-2023/#:~:text=McDonald's,That%20trend%20continues%20in%202023)). So with higher quality franchisees means that they will carry the MCD brand to a greater height having more commitment/experience, deeper pockets to sustain through down periods and dedication to innovate.  
Zero Territorial Franchising – Unlike nearly all franchisers during the 1950-60’s and even today, McDonald’s does not grant regional licenses to a single franchisee…Burger King under Pillsbury, for example, was forced to acquire Diversifoods in 1985 to gain complete control over its largest franchisee as a means to improve quality. Conversely, McDonald's only allows additional stores per franchisee once baseline requirements have been met on a store-by-store basis.  
**REVENUE:**  
When forecasting Stores,  
the rationale I took was from “We want to continue to drive strong top line momentum so that we have that momentum through these pressures and then, of course, out of the pressures and begin to kind of recover margins and gain leverage as we go forward.” - 2022 Q4 Earnings Conference.  
Management has given guidance in their 2022 Q4 Earnings conference that they expect to net add 1500 stores in 2023. However, this number was taken before the war in Ukraine had fully begun. So, I’d assume that management only meets about 33% of their goal.  
Going forward, I’d assume that management grows at an elevated amount due to all the marketing spend they made on their Accelerating the Arches programme for the next 3 years while inflation stabilizes. Beyond that, I’ll assume that management focuses on monetizing these stores.  
When forecasting Revenue/Store,  
I’m cautious in increasing the revenue/store to a significant extent. MCD is a fast food restaurant where their value proposition comes from being able to purchase a meal at affordable prices. The quantity sold could arguably be higher due to “shrinkflation” that pushes consumers to buy a higher quantity of food in order to be satisfied. Management constantly talks about how they take pride in being the most value for money meal amongst their competitors. But, MCD has to keep somewhat in line with inflation to protect margins. In the first 3 years of Accelerating the Arches programme, I’d assume that Revenue/Store grows at a steady rate but overtime when inflation abates management slows price growth to continue their belief in providing value for money.  
**COST:**  
Due to tension in Europe, MCD has to provide relief to their European franchisee.  
MCD has stated that they are looking towards using data to optimize their restaurants and push out areas of inefficiency in the operations. As seen from 2022 Q4 and 2023 Q2 Earnings Conference. “With about 90% of our business currently coming through digital channels in that market, it was remarkable to see how the market has forged digital relationships with customers. China is also making tremendous progress in running the restaurants more efficiently, all with the use of data and technology.” - 2023 Q2 Earnings Conference.  
When forecasting COGS,  
the main cost in this category comes from stores which are owned by MCD corporation themselves. From FY21 to FY22 due to the number of MCD owned stores declining they are less affected by inflation so there is a fall in COGS. So, seeing that MCD wants to maintain 95% franchised we can assume that cost cutting comes from economies of scale or better data usage allowing MCD restaurants to be better optimized.  
When forecasting SG&amp;A,  
as the cost of labor is elevated due to the tight labor market I’d assume that it takes 3 years before SG&amp;A regresses back down to pre covid levels.  
**CapEX and D&amp;A:**  
When forecasting D&amp;A,  
opting for less granularity I’d assume it follows historical trends.  
When forecasting CapEX,  
I’d assume CapEX spend remains elevated as seen in FY22 for the next 3 years before tapering down.  
**Sanity Check:**  
MCD has a ROIC of 21% ([SOURCE](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ROIC/MCD/ROIC%20%25/McDonald's%20Corp))  
\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/CXu0Wrm)\] I'd assume that MCD ROIC increases as they invest in using more data to better optimize their restaurants.  
**WACC:**  
*Cost of Equity*  
US bond is AA+, yield spread (1M Avg) 0.66  
US 10Y T-Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.72  
RFR = 4.06%  
4050 = (4050 \* 4.25%) \* (1+16%) / (1+R) + \[((4050 \* 4.25%) \* (1+16%)) \* (1+3.82%) / (R - 3.82%)\] / (1 + R) \^ 2  
R = 10.3%, ERP = 6.24%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCD/)) = 0.64  
COE = 8.05%  
*Cost of Debt*  
MCD bond is BBB  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21%  
BBB bond yield ([SOURCE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLC0A4CBBBEY)) = 6.29%  
AT Bond Yield = 4.97%  
*Weightage*  
Market Price (5D Avg) = $261  
Shares O/S = 731M  
Market Value of Equity = 190791M  
\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/UthtIGf)\]  
Weighted average life of 8 Years, FY22 rent expense = 1476.1M  
MV Lease Liability = 18232M  
As MCD does not break down the debt obligation, I took BV debt.  
BV debt = 35904M  
Total Liability = 54136M  
%Debt = 22.1%  
%Equity = 77.9%  
WACC = 7.37%  
**OTHERS:**  
*Net Operating Loss*  
Given that MCD does not explicitly break down their NOLs stating “the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $407.5 million, of which $174.6 million has an indefinite carryforward. The remainder will expire at various dates from 2023 to 2040.” To be conservative, I’ll only consider 174.6M of NOLs.  
*Stock Options*  
In 2022, MCD has 11.4M shares of options contract at Weighted Average Strike Price of $172.27 which is In-The-Money(ITM).  
So using the treasury stock method,  
Total Cash from options = 1963.88M  
Average Stock Price (5D Avg) = $261  
Shares able to buy back = 7.5M  
Net Addition = 3.9M Shares.  
**CONCLUSION:**  
Ultimately, I value MCD at $191.82 per share. I believe that MCD is overly hyped by investors who are way too optimistic about MCD's store count going up at ever increasing rates. This is unrealistic given current macro environment making any new store opening at Europe returning significantly less than average returns. The property crisis in China eroding confidence of franchisees and the strong Asian competitors e.g. Jollibee who caters more to local taste buds. I do not believe that MCD can continue strong growth for as long as investor's expect. However, given the business model of MCD, slowing growth could mean a death sentence as margins are more or less fixed. The business model is one where the end goal is absolute profits.

&lt;h1&gt;INTRODUCTION:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MCD&amp;#39;s golden arches are famous worldwide, it&amp;#39;s precisely this strong goodwill that allows their business to remain attractive to franchisees for so long. The consistent quality of each MCD store regardless of where it is on earth, the large cost advantage due to how large the franchise has become and Quality of franchisee give MCD strong cash flows. However, MCD might be overly hyped by investors who assumes that the firm can just keep opening stores regardless of the macro environment which is not true.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;INVESTMENT THESIS 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Strong Quality Control (QC)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
MCD has a strong QC that many other fast food brands are unable to replicate. From the ingredients that they receive from suppliers (Fries, Cooking Oil, Nuggets etc.) to the training procedure (Timing to cook, how to maintain freshness, stringent training etc.) (&lt;a href=""https://www.franchisedirect.com/information/markettrendsfactsaboutfranchising/thesuccessofmcdonalds/8/1111/#:%7E:text=Consistency%2C%20of%20course%2C%20is%20vital,decision%20on%20where%20to%20eat""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;). MCD has consistently produced quality products to its customers, this consistent quality is something customers are used to throughout their time with MCD allowing MCD to build strong brand goodwill. Furthermore, for other fast food chains to start their QC process now, it will be an uphill battle as there needs to be an overseer on what quality should be the standard and how they should go about fixing the quality. Strong QC also means that the experience in every MCD regardless of location will be consistent, allowing every MCD across the world to tap into MCD’s strong global goodwill.&lt;br/&gt;
MCD has a Performance and Customer Excellence program, also known as PACE. PACE is a program by MCD to help consult poorly run franchises ensuring that standards are met.&lt;br/&gt;

https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/rising-interest-rates-mean-deficits-finally-matter-74249719


* The scale and upward trajectory of U.S. borrowing and absence of any political corrective now threaten markets and the economy in ways they haven’t for at least a generation.
* Most of the recent sharp increase in yields is due to a part of yields called the term premium.  Numerous factors affect the term premium, and rising government deficits are a prime suspect. 
* Today, central banks are worried about inflation being too high and have stopped buying and in some cases are shedding their bondholdings (“quantitative tightening”). Suddenly, fiscal policy matters again.
*  Investors, asked to buy more bonds, gradually make room in their portfolios by buying less of something else, such as equities. Eventually, the risk-adjusted returns of these assets equalize, which means higher bond yields and lower price/earnings ratios on stocks.
* “We had a blissful 25 years of not having to worry about this problem... It’s not that no one shows up to buy Treasurys. It’s that they ask for a much higher yield,” said Mark Wiedman, senior managing director at BlackRock. 


The U.S. has long been the lender of last resort to the world. During the emerging-market panics of the 1990s, the global financial crisis of 2007-09 and the pandemic shutdown of 2020, it was the Treasury’s unmatched capacity to borrow that came to the rescue.

Now, the Treasury itself is a source of risk. No, the U.S. isn’t about to default or fail to sell enough bonds at its next auction. But the scale and upward trajectory of U.S. borrowing and absence of any political corrective now threaten markets and the economy in ways they haven’t for at least a generation.

That’s the takeaway from the sudden sharp rise in Treasury yields in recent weeks. The usual suspects can’t explain it: The inflation picture has gotten marginally better, and the Federal Reserve has signaled it’s nearly done raising rates. 

Instead, most of the increase is due to the part of yields, called the term premium, which has nothing to do with inflation or short-term rates. Numerous factors affect the term premium, and rising government deficits are a prime suspect. 

Deficits have been wide for years. Why would they matter now? A better question might be: What took so long? 

That larger deficits push up long-term rates had long been economic orthodoxy. But for the past 20 years, interest-rate models that incorporated fiscal policy didn’t work, noted Riccardo Trezzi, a former Fed economist who now runs his own research firm, Underlying Inflation. 

That’s understandable. Central banks—worried about too-low inflation and stagnant growth—had kept interest rates around zero while buying up government bonds (“quantitative easing”). Private demand for credit was weak. This trumped any concern about deficits.

“We had a blissful 25 years of not having to worry about this problem,” said Mark Wiedman, senior managing director at BlackRock. 

Today, though, central banks are worried about inflation being too high and have stopped buying and in some cases are shedding their bondholdings (“quantitative tightening”). Suddenly, fiscal policy matters again. 

To paraphrase Hemingway, deficits can affect interest rates gradually or suddenly. Investors, asked to buy more bonds, gradually make room in their portfolios by buying less of something else, such as equities. Eventually, the risk-adjusted returns of these assets equalize, which means higher bond yields and lower price/earnings ratios on stocks. That has been happening for the past month.

Sometimes, though, markets can move suddenly, such as when Mexico threatened to default in 1994 and Greece did default a decade later. Even in countries that, unlike Mexico or Greece, borrow in currencies they control, interest rates can become hostage to deficits, such as in Canada in the early 1990s or Italy in the 1980s and early 1990s. 

The U.S. isn’t Canada or Italy; it controls the world’s reserve currency, and its inflation and interest rates are mostly driven by domestic, not foreign, factors. On the other hand, the U.S. has also exploited those advantages to accumulate debt and run deficits that are much larger than those of peer economies.

There’s not much sign that this has yet imposed a penalty. Investors still project that the Fed will get inflation down to its 2% goal. At 2.4%, real (inflation-adjusted) Treasury yields are comparable to those in the mid-2000s and lower than in the 1990s, when the U.S. government’s debts and deficits were much lower.

Still, sometimes bad news accumulates below investors’ radar until something brings their collective attention to bear. Could a point come when “all the headlines will be about the fiscal unsustainability of the U.S.?” asked Wiedman. “I don’t hear this today from global investors. But do I think it could happen? Absolutely, that paradigm shift is possible. It’s not that no one shows up to buy Treasurys. It’s that they ask for a much higher yield.”

It’s notable that the recent rise in bond yields came as Fitch Ratings downgraded its U.S. credit rating, Treasury upped the size of its bond auctions, analysts began revising upward this year’s federal deficit, and Congress nearly shut down parts of the government over a failure to pass spending bills.

The federal deficit was over 7% of gross domestic product in fiscal 2023, after adjusting for accounting distortions related to student debt, Barclays analysts noted last week. That’s larger than any deficit since 1930 outside of wars and recessions. And this is occurring at a time of low unemployment and strong economic growth, suggesting that in normal times, “deficits may be much higher,” Barclays added.

Abroad, fiscal policy has clearly begun to matter. Last fall, a proposed U.K. tax cut triggered a surge in British bond yields; the government scrapped the proposal, then resigned. Italian yields have risen since the government last week delayed reducing its deficit to below European guidelines. Trezzi said that for the past decade the European Central Bank had bought more than 100% of net Italian government bond issuance, but that’s coming to an end.

Foreign investors, worried about inflation and deficits, have been selling Italian bonds, while Italian households have been buying, Trezzi said. “With a weakening economy, it is unclear for how long…households can offset the selloff of foreigners.”

Investors looking for U.S. political will to rein in deficits would take note that both former President Donald Trump and President Biden, their parties’ front-runners for the 2024 presidential nomination, have signed deficit-busting legislation and that both of their parties have pledged not to cut the two largest spending programs, Medicare and Social Security, or raise taxes on most households. 

They would also notice that the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives was just ousted by rebels in his own party because he had passed a bipartisan spending bill to prevent the government from shutting down. True, the rebels wanted less spending. But shutdowns, Barclays noted, represent “erosion of governance.” This isn’t how a country trying to reassure the bond market acts.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

* Walmart is studying changes in sales patterns by looking at anonymized shopper data and comparing that of people who take a weight loss drug like Ozempic to people who don’t, but Furner said it’s too soon to draw conclusions.
* The company is seeing “a slight pullback in overall basket” when looking at the consumer data, though, for people who take Ozempic, Wegovy or other popular weight-loss drugs, Furner told Bloomberg.
* Furner said the pullback has been “just less units, slightly less calories,” Bloomberg reported.
* Companies like Walmart are working to take stock of shopper trends for people on Ozempic as the weight-loss drug is only expected to continue its rise in popularity: Morgan Stanley is estimating that 24 million people—or 7% of the U.S. population—could be taking GLP-1 drugs by 2035.
* In its September report, Morgan Stanley said the popularity of these drugs will likely have a stronger impact on grocery stores, while big box markets like Walmart and Target that sell “many product categories along with food will be better insulated.”

Walmart U.S. chief executive John Furner said in an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday that the company has seen “a slight change” in food purchasing habits of people taking Ozempic and other weight loss drugs compared to people who aren’t—as impacts of the popular medication seep into the corporate world.

Ozempic, Wegovy and other weight loss drugs that have risen in popularity in recent years cause weight loss by reducing people’s appetites. The GLP-1 drugs mimic a hormone that signals to one’s brain that they’re full, according to UC Davis Health. The drug has also decreased some patients' cravings to eat foods with high sugar or fat content, though, CNBC reported, which could cause problems for some food brands that have decided in recent years to lean into snacking while marketing their food. Food chains and companies producing junk food were predicted to be potential losers of the weight loss drug boom because of the decreased appetite for unhealthy foods, Markets Insider reported last week.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if these drugs become popular enough, could they have a bigger impact on big food and beverage chains DPZ, QSR, MCD, PEP, KO, etc.?&lt;/p&gt;

45,stocks,"With bond yields rising, a company that has high debt has a significant earnings drag.  Rising yields makes new borrowing expensive and kills growth, even when you are diligently releasing new products and retiring old unpopular ones.  Also bond yields rising pushes us toward recession, whether we actually get to recession naturally I don't know, but consumer staples put you in a prepared spot for it.

The following is a list of low debt consumer staples names with competitive dividends.  Throwing in PFE because it is recession friendly even if not a consumer staple name.

PFE, KHC, TSN, HRL

somewhat less competitive dividend 2% &lt; Div &lt; 3%   but still low debt

JNJ, BG, MDLZ, ADM

Some good consumer staples names with good dividends that have more debt

K, GIS, CPB, REYN, CAG, CPB    among these six names CAG has the lowest debt to equity

Other stocks with high dividends but also higher debt but not amongst the highest I found

T, VZ

Stocks with debt too high for me personally and a dividend to fool you into thinking it is a good idea (clearly not an attempt to be a complete list, but amongst those I recently analyzed at a basic level:

WEN, WM, SO, ABBV, SYY, F, PEP, SO, most airline stocks that are not LUV

I have lost faith in USA bonds.  I won't own them.  This is where I go to invest next, especially the 1st and 2nd groups above.

No-champion-2194 took me to school in pointing out that debt to EBITDA and/or debt to net income is probably a better way to look at it than debt to equity.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;With bond yields rising, a company that has high debt has a significant earnings drag.  Rising yields makes new borrowing expensive and kills growth, even when you are diligently releasing new products and retiring old unpopular ones.  Also bond yields rising pushes us toward recession, whether we actually get to recession naturally I don&amp;#39;t know, but consumer staples put you in a prepared spot for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of low debt consumer staples names with competitive dividends.  Throwing in PFE because it is recession friendly even if not a consumer staple name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PFE, KHC, TSN, HRL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;somewhat less competitive dividend 2% &amp;lt; Div &amp;lt; 3%   but still low debt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JNJ, BG, MDLZ, ADM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some good consumer staples names with good dividends that have more debt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K, GIS, CPB, REYN, CAG, CPB    among these six names CAG has the lowest debt to equity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other stocks with high dividends but also higher debt but not amongst the highest I found&lt;/p&gt;

46,stocks,"This may sound like a stupid question, but how do you make money on stocks after you've had a period of gains? You don't want to sell your whole position, but also want to take advantage of the, say, $5,000 profit since the stock went up.

Does it make sense to sell shares equal to the $5,000 gain and re-invest it elsewhere or sit on it to buy again if the stock dips?

I wonder because as we have been seeing a market downturn, what sense does it make to sit and watch those gains dwindle toward nothing while the experts tell me that now is the time to invest to dollar cost average my holding? Is it also considered DCA to cash out the amount of the gain without selling the whole position and re-buy the stock at a lower price later?

MMM - Class Action lawsuits have been pushing it down but seems to have settled the lawsuits from what I've heard? Now more of a high value/dividend play.

BEPC -Brookfield Renewable, seems to me Utilities have been slaughtered recently but this is looking very attractive, don't quite understand the sentiment and why it's valued so lowly with a 5% dividend

ASO - Academy Sports and Outdoors Inc P/E of only 6.4 with a forward p/e of 5.8 seems to be heavily discounted, yet shorted heavily.

TGT - Target, retail sentiment pushing a lot down but Target feels like an American staple that isn't going away at this point. Definitely see more hard times coming for it and see it going down to the 90's

DG - Dollar General- I see this sentiment a lot especially on this sub, but it's almost as if people are at war with each other over this stock. Some thinking it's going to bounce back with better management, other's thinking it's terrible and dollar stores are going to be a thing of the past, despite their seemingly dominance in the midwest.

PYPL- Whilst not a dividend stock, this is more and more attractive the lower it gets, I see it slowly transitioning into a cash cow, and feel that 1 good earning call it's gonna fly . It's a matter of timing the bottom, personally looking at sub 50

SE- I know this doesn't fit the high value tag at all, but more curious on peoples thoughts on this stock,  seems to be growing at quite a rapid rate and far from its ATH in 2021.

Towards the end I know it got a bit messy but I'd love to hear everyones opinion whether good or bad on these (mostly) value plays

49,stocks,"Meta is considering introducing subscription-based, ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The move aims to comply with the EU's new ad privacy regulations. The subscription fee would start at around €10 ($10.50) for desktop users and rise to about $14 for mobile users, accounting for commissions charged by Apple and Google's app stores. The subscription model is still under review for compliance with EU laws. This comes after Meta faced a $1.3 billion fine from European regulators for data privacy violations.

**Regulatory Arbitrage**:
Meta's decision can be viewed as a form of regulatory arbitrage, aimed at circumventing the stringent data privacy laws enforced by the European Union. Given the EU's propensity for imposing substantial fines, this move could serve as a risk mitigation strategy, thereby stabilizing the company's regulatory profile.

**Revenue Diversification and Financial Stability**:
The introduction of a subscription-based revenue model is a strategic pivot away from the increasingly volatile ad-based revenue streams. This diversification could serve to stabilize Meta's cash flows, thereby making it a more attractive and less risky investment in the long term.

**Market Test for Global Scalability**:
The European market will act as a bellwether for the viability of this new revenue model. A successful implementation in Europe could pave the way for a global rollout, offering a significant upside potential for revenue growth and stock appreciation.

**Industry Precedence and Competitive Moats**:
By being the first to introduce a subscription-based model in the social media landscape, Meta has the opportunity to build a competitive moat. This first-mover advantage could deter competitors from entering the space, thereby consolidating Meta's market share and potentially driving up its valuation.

**User Adoption as a Leading Indicator**:
The rate of user adoption will serve as a leading indicator for the success of this initiative. High adoption rates could signify a paradigm shift in consumer preferences, moving away from ad-supported to subscription-based models. This could have a ripple effect on Meta's long-term revenue and profitability metrics.

* Job openings totaled 9.61 million for the month, a jump of nearly 700,000 from July and well above the Dow Jones estimate for 8.8 million.

* Much of the increase in openings came in professional and business services, which showed a burst of 509,000.

* Quits remained around flat as previous month, in line with normal pre-Covid levels.  Layoffs also remained relatively unchanged, notably below pre-Covid.

Employment vacancies at U.S. businesses unexpectedly surged in August, a sign that the labor market remains tight and robust despite the Federal Reserve’s efforts to slow the economy.

Job openings totaled 9.61 million for the month, a jump of nearly 700,000 from July and well above the Dow Jones estimate for 8.8 million, the Labor Department said Tuesday in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.

Hires, however, rose only modestly, moving up to 5.857 million, an increase of just 35,000.

Much of the increase in openings came in professional and business services, which showed a burst of 509,000.

Stocks fell following the report as a tighter labor market could put more pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates elevated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average most recently was off more than 260 points on the session.

The Fed follows the JOLTS report closely for signs of labor slack.

Openings had been on the decline for the last several months, indicating that the central bank’s interest rates hikes were beginning to have an impact on a labor market that had been hit by a large supply-demand mismatch in which openings had outnumbered available workers 2 to 1. The ratio now is down to 1.5 to 1, following an increase of workers classified as unemployed in August.

The August JOLTS report comes just a few days ahead of the department’s nonfarm payrolls count for September. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect that report, due Friday, to show an increase of 170,000.

Quits, a measure of worker confidence in finding a new job after leaving a previous position, were little changed. That also was the case with total separations and layoffs.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/03/august-job-openings-top-9point6-million-more-than-expected-as-labor-market-remains-strong.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/03/august-job-openings-top-9point6-million-more-than-expected-as-labor-market-remains-strong.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

i have tried my luck a couple of times now with Knock-out products. I have won some, i have lost some. So far, i never held a Knock-out for more than 8 or 10 days.

Beeing not that experienced, i was wondering if it would make sense to you buy such a product, with a lower leverage of maybe x2 or x3 to lower the risk and hold it for a longer time, maybe like 1 month or more.

The thought is, that if i have already chosen a stock that i like and that i am willing to buy in to, why not use the leverage to gain more profits? If things go the wrong way, i can still keep track and cut my losses. With low leverage things shouldnt get out of hand this quickly. Also, the cost of a Knock-out is usually not that high.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

59,stocks,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/02/microsoft-ceo-testifies-about-competing-with-google-in-antitrust-trial.html

When it comes to online search, it’s Google’s web and everyone else is playing in it, according to rival Microsoft. That was the essence of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s testimony in federal court on Monday as part of the government’s antitrust trial against Google. Nadella told the court that Google’s dominant market share in online search means that publishers and advertisers shape their content to Google’s requirements, making it harder for competitors like Microsoft’s Bing to gain a foothold.

“Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web,” Nadella said from the stand in Washington, D.C., District Court. Nadella was referring to the way publishers often cater their content and advertising to Google’s products, like by optimizing their pages for how Google ranks search results. Nadella was questioned by lawyers for the Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general who are suing Google for allegedly violating antitrust laws by illegally maintaining a monopoly in the general search market. The government argues that Google locked up distribution channels for general search engines through exclusive deals with browser and phone makers to be the default choice on various devices. Perhaps the most famous of those deals is the multibillion-dollar agreement between Google and Apple to make Google search the default on Apple products like the iPhone.

The government has tried to make the case that Google’s dominance, aided by these exclusive deals, creates a flywheel effect, where greater exposure to users leads to more data to make Google’s search results better and attracts more advertisers to the product. That, in turn, generates more revenue that can be used to fund these massive distribution deals. Meanwhile, the government argues, it becomes even harder for rivals to breakthrough to consumers, and as a result, they miss out on the opportunity for greater benefits or innovations in search. Nadella affirmed that argument in his testimony Monday, describing the obstacles a general search competitor like Bing faces to gain more market share from Google.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/02/microsoft-ceo-testifies-about-competing-with-google-in-antitrust-trial.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/02/microsoft-ceo-testifies-about-competing-with-google-in-antitrust-trial.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

60,stocks,"Hey, so I have been trading for about 1 year now. I started out trading crypto and then a few months later transitioned to trading stocks. I went through many phases, which included day trading, day trading penny stocks, swing trading big stocks, swing trading penny stocks, and now I have come to swing trading mid-cap stocks (1B+).  
  
So for this strategy, I first started out by using trading view screener(or any basic screener) and looking for the largest daily losers that are 1B+ mkt cap. Then I would add these stocks to a watchlist, some days would range from 3 -7 stocks. Then I would monitor them over the next 4 or so days and would watch them consolidate.  
  
Of those stocks that did consolidate during that time period, I would choose a few that had moved to the top of their box and were primed for a breakout. I would place a stop-buy order above the level of resistance and would buy with about half of my portfolio.  
  
So I would run this screener every day and add a few to my watchlist and watch those that behaved like above. The problem with this is that many stocks have a false breakout and fall down incurring me with losses. I suppose I could place a stop sell order right under the ristsance turned support level to protect my position.  
  
Now I have transitioned to using the screener once every week, and look for the biggest loser from 1B+ in the entire week.  
  
I know this is very wordy, but any comments would be appreciated and how I can improve.  
  
Also, does anyone know how I could backtest a strategy like this where it uses tickers from a screener and then identifies a resistance level?

EG: I understand that the value of stock is correlated to market confidence in the brand and the supply/demand of it all, etc. BUT what specifically happens to translate all that into the stock ticker going up or down.

What exactly transpires between the stock market reacting to an event and the value you see on the stock market, is a guy entering a thing into a computer that says ""this is how much this is worth now?"" I have always wanted to know this.

Consumers should be spending less by now. 

Interest rates are up. Inflation remains high. Pandemic savings have shrunk. And the labor market is cooling.  

Yet household spending, the primary driver of the nation’s economic growth, remains robust. Americans spent 5.8% more in August than a year earlier, well outstripping less than 4% inflation. And the experience economy boomed this summer, with Delta Air Lines reporting record revenue in the second quarter and Ticketmaster selling over 295 million event tickets in the first six months of 2023, up nearly 18% year-over-year. 

Economists and financial advisers say consumers putting short-term needs and goals above long-term ones is normal. Still, this moment is different, they say. 

A tough housing market has more consumers writing off something they’d historically save for, while the pandemic showed the instability of any long-term plans related to health, work or day-to-day life. So, they are spending on once-in-a-lifetime experiences because they worry they may not be able to do them later. 

“It’s not a regret-filled, spur-of-the-moment decision,” says Michael Liersch, who oversees a team of advisers as head of advice at Wells Fargo. “It’s the opposite of that, where I would regret not having done it.” 

Liersch cautions that it’s too soon to say whether the spate of spending is a fleeting moment or a new normal. And consumers remain frustrated about inflation as the price of many goods remains significantly higher than a few years ago.

Ibby Hussain, who works in marketing for a financial communications firm, says the Brooklyn, N.Y., apartment he and his fiancée rent for $3,000 a month would cost a million dollars to buy. At current rates, that means around $5,000 a month after a $200,000 down payment, not including property taxes. “And it’s not even that nice of an apartment.” 

So, instead of saving for a down payment like he expected to after turning 30 and getting engaged in the past year, he splurged. 

First, he bought a $1,600 Taylor Swift Eras Tour ticket and then he spent $3,500 on a bachelor party trip to Ibiza, Spain. 

“I might as well just enjoy what I have now,” he says. 

**A travel boom**

Ally Bank, whose online platform started allowing customers to create savings buckets for different goals in 2020, says users create about one-and-a-half times more experience-oriented buckets such as travel and “fun funds” versus those associated with longer-term planning. 

Lindsey and Darrell Bradshaw went into credit-card debt to finance a vacation to Maui this past spring. The couple booked the trip only a few weeks after Lindsey, 37, quit her job to be a full-time caregiver to their 8-year-old son, who has special needs. 


“We did not have the money and we were like, ‘Let’s just do this anyway,’ ” says Darrell Bradshaw, a 39-year-old general contractor in Seattle. 

The trip cost about $10,000, including three, $1,000 last-minute plane tickets, 10 nights at a $385-a-night 4-star resort and several elaborate meals. 

Even though the family decided to cancel subscriptions and cut back on dining out to help offset the bill, they say they have no regrets—especially since they got to see Lahaina just a few months before it was decimated by deadly wildfires. 

Fears about a changing climate are driving some people to try to see places before they’re gone. In a monthly Deloitte survey of 19,000 global consumers, climate change was the only topic among 19 different concerns that respondents reported feeling significantly more worried about over the past year.  

Josh Richner says he greatly lowered his retirement contribution to afford a cross-country trip that included a $7,000 Alaskan cruise so his family could see the ice caps, which have been melting at a rapid clip. 

“I’ve never spent that much on a trip before,” says the 35-year-old, who says the splurge was also motivated by the pandemic and a health scare. 

About six months ago, Richner and his wife decided to sell their Columbus, Ohio, home to travel the country with their two young children. Working for National Legal Center, a law firm that helps consumers resolve debt, he knows the potential consequences of living in a way that gives priority to the present. But he isn’t worried. 

“I just hit a point where the thing that we had been talking about maybe hopefully doing some day, we’re going to do it now,” he says. “I’m not going to worry about money anymore. I don’t have it in me.”  




**Splurge purchases**

Consumers might not be able to keep splurging forever. Labor strikes and student loan repayments could both lead people to pull back. Rising gas prices could also deter travel. 

For those who study spending, however, the robustness up to this point has been a surprise. 

In the New York Federal Reserve Bank’s August SCE Household Spending Survey, households reported spending 5.5% more than last year. The share of households that said they made at least one large purchase in the previous four months increased to 64% from 57%, its highest reading since August 2015.

“Normally at a time when you have higher inflation, but also higher interest rates, you don’t expect spending to hold up so well,” says Wilbert van der Klaauw, an economic research adviser on household and public policy at the Fed.

Rather than funnel all their spare change into a house or retirement account, Candice and Jasmine Kelly started a bucket-list fund after attending back-to-back funerals a few months ago. The couple adds a few hundred dollars from their paychecks each month into the fund, which they have used to try fancy restaurant tasting menus and buy Jasmine her dream designer handbag.  

Instead of waiting to have fun when they retire, Candice, a 26-year-old management analyst in Charlotte, N.C., says the couple is trying to do the opposite. They want to enjoy their money while they’re young—even if it means working longer.  

“All the rules that exist around money and lifestyle are just things people made up, so we’re playing a different game, and honestly I think we’re having more fun,” says Candice.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/economy/consumers/americans-are-still-spending-like-theres-no-tomorrow-6a1d307""&gt;https://www.wsj.com/economy/consumers/americans-are-still-spending-like-theres-no-tomorrow-6a1d307&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The experience economy boomed this summer.  Airlines had record revenues and Ticketmaster had 18% YoY increase in ticket sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the NY Fed, the share of households that said they made at least one large purchase in the previous four months increased to 64% from 57%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Normally at a time when you have higher inflation, but also higher interest rates, you don’t expect spending to hold up so well,” says Wilbert van der Klaauw, an economic research adviser on household and public policy at the Fed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of saving for retirement or a home which seems out of reach, younger consumers are choosing to spend on experiences with a willingness to work longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers should be spending less by now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest rates are up. Inflation remains high. Pandemic savings have shrunk. And the labor market is cooling.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet household spending, the primary driver of the nation’s economic growth, remains robust. Americans spent 5.8% more in August than a year earlier, well outstripping less than 4% inflation. And the experience economy boomed this summer, with Delta Air Lines reporting record revenue in the second quarter and Ticketmaster selling over 295 million event tickets in the first six months of 2023, up nearly 18% year-over-year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists and financial advisers say consumers putting short-term needs and goals above long-term ones is normal. Still, this moment is different, they say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tough housing market has more consumers writing off something they’d historically save for, while the pandemic showed the instability of any long-term plans related to health, work or day-to-day life. So, they are spending on once-in-a-lifetime experiences because they worry they may not be able to do them later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a regret-filled, spur-of-the-moment decision,” says Michael Liersch, who oversees a team of advisers as head of advice at Wells Fargo. “It’s the opposite of that, where I would regret not having done it.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liersch cautions that it’s too soon to say whether the spate of spending is a fleeting moment or a new normal. And consumers remain frustrated about inflation as the price of many goods remains significantly higher than a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibby Hussain, who works in marketing for a financial communications firm, says the Brooklyn, N.Y., apartment he and his fiancée rent for $3,000 a month would cost a million dollars to buy. At current rates, that means around $5,000 a month after a $200,000 down payment, not including property taxes. “And it’s not even that nice of an apartment.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, instead of saving for a down payment like he expected to after turning 30 and getting engaged in the past year, he splurged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, he bought a $1,600 Taylor Swift Eras Tour ticket and then he spent $3,500 on a bachelor party trip to Ibiza, Spain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I might as well just enjoy what I have now,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A travel boom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ally Bank, whose online platform started allowing customers to create savings buckets for different goals in 2020, says users create about one-and-a-half times more experience-oriented buckets such as travel and “fun funds” versus those associated with longer-term planning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lindsey and Darrell Bradshaw went into credit-card debt to finance a vacation to Maui this past spring. The couple booked the trip only a few weeks after Lindsey, 37, quit her job to be a full-time caregiver to their 8-year-old son, who has special needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We did not have the money and we were like, ‘Let’s just do this anyway,’ ” says Darrell Bradshaw, a 39-year-old general contractor in Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip cost about $10,000, including three, $1,000 last-minute plane tickets, 10 nights at a $385-a-night 4-star resort and several elaborate meals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the family decided to cancel subscriptions and cut back on dining out to help offset the bill, they say they have no regrets—especially since they got to see Lahaina just a few months before it was decimated by deadly wildfires. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fears about a changing climate are driving some people to try to see places before they’re gone. In a monthly Deloitte survey of 19,000 global consumers, climate change was the only topic among 19 different concerns that respondents reported feeling significantly more worried about over the past year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh Richner says he greatly lowered his retirement contribution to afford a cross-country trip that included a $7,000 Alaskan cruise so his family could see the ice caps, which have been melting at a rapid clip. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never spent that much on a trip before,” says the 35-year-old, who says the splurge was also motivated by the pandemic and a health scare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About six months ago, Richner and his wife decided to sell their Columbus, Ohio, home to travel the country with their two young children. Working for National Legal Center, a law firm that helps consumers resolve debt, he knows the potential consequences of living in a way that gives priority to the present. But he isn’t worried. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I just hit a point where the thing that we had been talking about maybe hopefully doing some day, we’re going to do it now,” he says. “I’m not going to worry about money anymore. I don’t have it in me.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Splurge purchases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers might not be able to keep splurging forever. Labor strikes and student loan repayments could both lead people to pull back. Rising gas prices could also deter travel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who study spending, however, the robustness up to this point has been a surprise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the New York Federal Reserve Bank’s August SCE Household Spending Survey, households reported spending 5.5% more than last year. The share of households that said they made at least one large purchase in the previous four months increased to 64% from 57%, its highest reading since August 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Normally at a time when you have higher inflation, but also higher interest rates, you don’t expect spending to hold up so well,” says Wilbert van der Klaauw, an economic research adviser on household and public policy at the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than funnel all their spare change into a house or retirement account, Candice and Jasmine Kelly started a bucket-list fund after attending back-to-back funerals a few months ago. The couple adds a few hundred dollars from their paychecks each month into the fund, which they have used to try fancy restaurant tasting menus and buy Jasmine her dream designer handbag.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of waiting to have fun when they retire, Candice, a 26-year-old management analyst in Charlotte, N.C., says the couple is trying to do the opposite. They want to enjoy their money while they’re young—even if it means working longer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All the rules that exist around money and lifestyle are just things people made up, so we’re playing a different game, and honestly I think we’re having more fun,” says Candice.&lt;/p&gt;

TL;DR

* Largest ever healthcare workers strike could begin if a deal is not reached by midnight Saturday.  Contract for 75,000 workers is set to expire.
* The union would like 6.5% raises first two years and 5.75% raises next two years.

IMHO strikes across the country are evidence that the consumer is  starting to really feel squeezed by the impacts of inflation.  With the tight labor market providing historical leverage to workers, I think this will lead to large wage gains across the board.  First, it will deliver them to unionized workers.

&gt;A labor contract for thousands of unionized health care workers across five states and Washington, DC, is set to expire on Saturday at 11:59 pm PT, potentially triggering the largest health care strike in US history.

&gt;More than 75,000 health care employees who work at hundreds of Kaiser Permanente facilities plan to strike from October 4 through October 7 if a labor deal is not reached.

&gt;While hospital management, doctors and registered nurses are not part of the work stoppage, experts say patients at Kaiser Permanente, which is one of the nation’s largest not-for-profit health providers, would likely feel the effects of the strike.

&gt;**Nearly half of Kaiser Permanente’s workforce may strike**

&gt;The workers who would strike across California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Virginia, and Washington, DC, are part of a coalition of eight unions. They work in a wide range of health care support positions, which include nursing assistants, x-ray technicians, pharmacists and optometrists, among other roles. The coalition represents about 40% of all of Kaiser Permanente’s staff, according to spokesperson Renee Saldana of Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare (SEIU-UHW). The SEIU-UHW is the largest union in the coalition.

&gt;In a statement to CNN on Thursday, Hilary Costa, a spokesperson for Kaiser Permanente, said progress had been made in the negotiations and urged workers to reject calls for a strike.

&gt;“While a strike threat is disappointing, it does not necessarily mean a strike will happen,” Costa said. “We take any threat to disrupt care for our members seriously and have plans in place to ensure we can continue to provide high-quality care should a strike actually occur next week.”

&gt;A short-term strike would likely not impact Kaiser Permanente’s revenue. Unlike traditional fee-for-service medical systems in the United States, Kaiser Permanente patients pay membership dues for health care services. Kaiser Permanente has 12.7 million members and operates 39 hospitals and 622 medical offices, according to its website.

&gt;If a resolution isn’t reached after a possible October strike, the SEIU-UHW said the coalition is prepared to launch a “longer, stronger” strike in November, when a separate contract expires for some unionized employees in Washington state, potentially adding additional workers to the picket line.

&gt;The coalition is asking for across-the-board raises to address the rising cost of living, job protections against outsourcing and subcontracted workers, updates to employees’ retiree medical benefits and a plan from Kaiser Permanente to address a staffing shortage “crisis” that left employees feeling overworked, according to SEIU-UHW’s website.

&gt;“Workers are really being squeezed right now,” said Saldana. “They went through the worst global health crisis in a generation and then they come out and they’re worried about paying rent, they’re worried about losing their house, they’re worried about living in their cars.”

&gt;**Efforts to reach a deal are ongoing**

&gt;The latest update from the coalition shows that the two sides are still far apart. The coalition is asking for an across-the-board 6.5% raise in the first two years of the labor contract and a 5.75% raise in the the next two years. According to the SEIU-UHW website, Kaiser Permanente has offered a maximum 4% raise for the first two years of the contract and a 3% raise for the next two years.

&gt;Betsy Twitchell, a representative for the coalition of Kaiser Permanente unions, told CNN that contract negotiations with Kaiser Permanente management will continue Saturday ahead of the 11:59 pm deadline.

&gt;“There can be no agreement until Kaiser executives stop bargaining in bad faith with frontline healthcare workers over the solutions needed to end the Kaiser short-staffing crisis,” Twitchell said.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: a deal has been failed to be reached, more than 75k workers are prepared to walk off the job starting &lt;a href=""https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/more-than-75000-kaiser-permanente-workers-prepare-for-three-day-strike/ar-AA1hwnab""&gt;Oct 4.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Largest ever healthcare workers strike could begin if a deal is not reached by midnight Saturday.  Contract for 75,000 workers is set to expire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The union would like 6.5% raises first two years and 5.75% raises next two years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMHO strikes across the country are evidence that the consumer is  starting to really feel squeezed by the impacts of inflation.  With the tight labor market providing historical leverage to workers, I think this will lead to large wage gains across the board.  First, it will deliver them to unionized workers.  Then, eventually other workers will try to catch up as businesses compete to retain and attract employees.&lt;/p&gt;

While not related to the labor strike, working with a Chinese company might give Ford more access to the Chinese markets, but they stopped selling their EV in China due to low demand. &lt;/p&gt;

102,stocks,"A low P/E ratio in the old days meant that a company was undervalued. However, accounting has changed a lot since.

I'd like to share an example that I recently stumbled across - Nokia.This post will also include some explanation related to tax loss carry forward, so if you're not familiar with that, that will change by the end.

Nokia has a P/E below 5. Prior to publishing the 2022 results, the P/E was 13. This means there was a HUGE increase in earnings (more than double). During the last year, the share price was down 18%, which seems a bit odd, for a company that just doubled its earnings, right?

Well, there's a good explanation for that.

Take a look at the following data:

2020: Profit before tax - EUR 743 million (Tax expense - EUR 3.3 billion)

2021: Profit before tax - EUR 1.9 billion (Tax expense - EUR 272 million)

2022: Profit before tax - EUR 2.2 billion (Tax benefit - EUR 2 billion)It seems that 2021 is the only year with a reasonable ratio between the expense and the profit before tax.

So, what happened in 2020 and 2022? Here's where tax loss carry forward comes into place. I'll try to elaborate with a simple example.

Imagine that you've started a business, and in the first year, you had a loss before tax of $10,000. In the majority of the countries, you can ""carry"" this loss forward into the next year, and use the losses to offset the profits.

Let's imagine your business had a profit before tax of $5,000 in year 2. Since you have $10,000 in losses carried forward, you can use half of that, to not pay taxes in year 2, and you still have $5,000 to carry forward in year 3.

Now, in year 3, the business did better, and your profit before tax was $8,000. Well, after using your last available losses, you have a tax base of $3,000. Let's assume that the tax rate is 25% --&gt; You have to pay a corporate income tax of $750.

How is this reflected in the accounting of the company?

At the end of year 1, the $10,000 losses will help you not pay taxes of $2,500 ($10,000 \* 25%). This will be shown as a deferred tax asset.

At the end of year 2, there are $5,000 losses still left, so the deferred tax asset will now be $1,250.

At the end of year 3, there won't be any deferred tax assets arising from losses.

In some countries, the losses can be carried forward for 3 years, in some 5, and in some indefinite.

However, losses from one country cannot be used to offset profits in another country.

So, if this is so simple, how does this explain the Nokia example above?

There's one catch. If the company is not expected to use these losses against profits on time, the company is not allowed to recognize a deferred tax expense. Otherwise, it would be misleading investors that they'll pay less taxes in the future.

Here's an extract from Nokia's annual report:

""*In 2020, Nokia de-recognized deferred tax assets in Finland, due to a regular assessment of our ability to utilize deferred tax assets in Finland for the foreseeable future, which was done primarily based on our historical performance.*

*At December 31 2022, Nokia concluded, based on its latest assessment, that it is probable that it will be able to utilize the unused tax losses and deductible temporary differences in Finland and re-recognized deferred tax assets of EUR 2.5 billion*""All of this is a fancy text that basically says:

In 2020, they expected the company not to be profitable on time, in order to use the losses the company generated in the past. So, the deferred tax asset that was previously recognized, is derecognized.

In 2022, this has changed, as the profitability in Finland improved, and now it is likely that the company will generate profits and be able to use the previously generated losses on time.This event led to huge swings in the income statement (and balance sheet) both in 2020 and 2022.

If we adjust the result of 2022 for the 2.5 billion, the net profit is closer to EUR 1.7 billion (vs. EUR 4.4 billion reported), so the P/E ratio of 4.8, is actually above 12.I hope that you enjoyed the post!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low P/E ratio in the old days meant that a company was undervalued.

107,stocks,"&gt; It began with a £1 contract.

&gt; In the hours after a pandemic was declared in March 2020, Palantir, the secretive American data analytics company, was invited to 10 Downing Street along with other tech groups, including Amazon, Google and Meta, to discuss how it could help the British government respond.

&gt; Within days, Palantir’s software was processing streams of data from across England’s National Health Service, with Palantir engineers embedded to help. The company’s services, used by the C.I.A. and Western militaries for more than a decade, were deployed to track emergency room capacity and direct supplies of scarce equipment.

&gt; Palantir charged the government just one pound.

&gt; The deal provided the company with a valuable toehold. Since then, Palantir, which is chaired by Peter Thiel, the billionaire investor and one of President Donald J. Trump’s major 2016 donors, has parlayed the work into more than £60 million in government health contracts. Its biggest reward may be yet to come: a seven-year contract worth up to £480 million — about $590 million — to overhaul N.H.S. England’s outdated patient data system.

&gt; But an outcry over Palantir’s rapid ascent within the N.H.S., the beleaguered but beloved public institution that provides free health care across the country, has been building for months among some lawmakers, doctors and privacy campaigners. It could come to a head in October, when the winning bid is expected to be announced.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

This led to its valuation being ""priced for perfection"" as bullish investor theories—including those from the buy-side—started to circulate. This is an odd paradigm because Burford's earnings can vary significantly over the course of any given year (due to the short-term unpredictability in the timing of case resolution and the binary hazards associated with any tiny subset of case resolution). It's like if I were to determine the P/E value of a hedge fund like Pershing Square while it trades and deals in derivatives and equities.  
There are very few things in life that are guaranteed, but betting on a virtually uncorrelated portfolio of results is nice to have when that company is developing a stellar reputation in the sector, a third party capital management business with high performance fees, and is trading below its liquidation value at the same time. As a company, Burford is not in a position to make large-scale investments all at once. A large amount of cash on the balance sheet would not be ideal given the time value of money. Burford's founders actually favoured operating the company with minimal levels of debt (D/E ratios under 0.3).  
Given Burford's current pricing, I anticipate that the company will soon sell a portion of the claim and reinvest the proceeds in either its operations, a special dividend to restore its investors' trust following the unfair and protracted Muddy Waters scandal, or a tiny buyback.  Argentina will probably agree to pay Burford in installments as well. Both sides might benefit from this. Last but not least, crude oil has performed well in recent years and could help Argentina's ability to pay by possibly include royalties on its oil reserves. There is some risk however, that Argentina will not pay despite having a track record of eventually settling claims.

Last but not least, crude oil has performed well in recent years and could help Argentina&amp;#39;s ability to pay by possibly include royalties on its oil reserves. There is some risk however, that Argentina will not pay despite having a track record of eventually settling claims. &lt;/p&gt;

Peloton and Lululemon, former foes, are teaming up together. The fitness companies announced a five-year “strategic global partnership,” which involves Lululemon ditching its Mirror fitness hardware and Peloton reducing production of its private-label line of fitness clothing. Beginning next month, Lululemon will become the primary maker of Peloton-branded fitness clothing, meaning Peloton will drastically reduce the number of its own clothing that it makes in-house. The clothing line sparked a lawsuit between the companies with Lululemon accusing Peloton of creating “copycat products.” The two companies settled the lawsuit last year. The new clothing line will be sold online and at Peloton studios beginning October 11. In return, Lululemon will stop selling its $995 Mirror fitness device by the end of the year and soon end producing its own Peloton-like fitness classes. In the next few months, Peloton’s streaming fitness classes will be available in the “Lululemon Studio” app for subscribers. Lululemon relaunched the app about a year ago as a Peloton rival, giving subscribers streaming classes from trendy fitness studios, like celebrity favorites AARMY and Dogpound.

Mirror has been a sore spot for Lululemon since its purchase during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The $500 million acquisition was written off earlier this year, essentially becoming worthless, and forced Lululemon to search for strategic alternatives to the device. A last-ditch effort in 2022 to cut its price and broaden its appeal with new fitness classes seemingly failed to generate interest from consumers. “By bringing together the best in fitness content with the best in athletic apparel, we’ll give our communities one-of-a-kind experiences and special content that will inspire them to achieve their goals,” said Dion Camp Sanders, Peloton’s chief emerging business officer, in a press release. The partnership stems from both companies realizing that “dabbling in areas outside of their core competencies was not yielding results,” according to Neil Saunders, a retail analyst for GlobalData.

“Peloton’s push into apparel was a failure as the selection was weak and looked incredibly lackluster in stores. The company was not doing sufficient volume to justify the operation,” Saunders told CNN. “Lululemon’s Mirror device was a flop because it was too expensive and too complex.” “The partnership is beneficial for both firms, but Peloton arguably needs it more as it is still on very shaky ground financially,” he added.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/28/business/peloton-lululemon-partnership/index.html""&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/28/business/peloton-lululemon-partnership/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Just hours after being named GameStop’s CEO, Ryan Cohen sent out a memo to employees on Thursday that emphasized he will take dramatic steps to ensure the struggling video game retailer survives.

“Our job is to make sure GameStop is here for decades to come,” he wrote in the email that was sent to corporate employees and store leaders and obtained by CNBC. “Extreme frugality is required. Every expense at the company must be scrutinized under a microscope and all waste eliminated. The company has no use for delegators and money wasters. I expect everyone to treat company money like their own and lead by example.”

Cohen, a billionaire activist investor and founder of direct-to-consumer pet food and supply retailer Chewy, was named the company’s new leader on Thursday morning. He was previously executive chairman of GameStop. As of late June, his firm RC Ventures was the company’s largest shareholder with a 12.09% stake, according to FactSet.

Cohen got the top job nearly four months after GameStop fired CEO Matthew Furlong. Cohen will not receive a salary in his new role.

Read the full memo below:

Subject: Survival
 
I will be straight to the point.
 
It is not sustainable for GameStop to operate a money losing business. The mission is to operate hyper efficiently and profitably. Our expense structure must allow us to endure any adverse scenario. Whether it’s a difficult economy or revenue deceleration from shrinking software, we must be profitable. Our job is to make sure GameStop is here for decades to come. Extreme frugality is required. Every expense at the company must be scrutinized under a microscope and all waste eliminated. The company has no use for delegators and money wasters. I expect everyone to treat company money like their own and lead by example.
 
Prospering in retail means survival. If we survive, we stay in the game. Survival is avoiding the deadly sins that often lead retailers to self-destruct. This is usually a result of the following - buying bad inventory, using leverage, and running expenses too high. By avoiding these self-inflicted mistakes and focusing on the basics, GameStop can be here for a long time.
 
I expect everyone to roll up their sleeves and work hard. I’m not getting paid, so I’m either going down with the ship or turning the company around. I much prefer the latter.
 
It won’t be easy. Best of luck to us all.

123,stocks,"Wall Street Journal out with an article that lets you plug in 5 simple variables to get a valuation for Tesla.

The 5 variables are: how many cars Tesla sells in 2030, average selling price of a Tesla car in 2030 in today’s dollars, operating margin, cost of capital, and how much Tesla’s other operations are worth.

The Wall Street Journal has 4 pre-set scenarios:

1. Bearish - $58.5 billion valuation based on 5 million cars at $30k with 8% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $0 valuation for other operations besides cars

2. Default - $381 billion valuation based on 7 million cars at $30k with 10% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $200 billion valuation for other operations.

3. Bullish - $770 billion valuation based on 10 million cars at $30k with 12% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, $400 billion for other operations

4. Superfan - $2.33 trillion valuation based on 20 million cars at $30k with 15% operating margin, 8% cost of capital, $600 billion for other operations

Their assumptions are as follows:

&gt; Our model is based on estimates of Tesla’s future cash flows. It multiplies anticipated vehicle sales in 2030 by the average anticipated price to calculate revenue, and then applies the expected operating margin to arrive at operating profit. Estimates for the years before 2030 assume a smooth path in the variables from this year’s FactSet analyst consensus.

&gt; Operating profit is taxed at an 11% rate (FactSet consensus for Tesla in 2023). Cash flows are then calculated as posttax operating profit minus capital expenditures while adding back depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures are assumed to be a flat 7% of revenue and depreciation and amortization 20% of capital expenditures.

&gt; Estimated cash flows through 2030 are discounted back to their present value at the discount rate and aggregated. A terminal value is added to account for Tesla’s cash flows beyond 2030, assuming a steady-state growth rate of 5%. The total of all these discounted estimated cash flows gives the theoretical enterprise value of Tesla’s core automotive business now.

&gt; We have left the value of its other businesses as a separate assumption within the model to arrive at a total enterprise value. Market value would also include the company’s cash or debt position, which we have not modeled.

Personally, as a Tesla bull who owns the stock, I believe Tesla is worth north of $1 trillion based on 10 million cars at $38k and 17% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, and $200B for other operations. I also believe that assuming 5% terminal growth post 2030 is too low.

I work at a smallish company, and my boss wants to do a pilot run of some public stock portfolios he has. It's relatively small base (probably no more than 100,000, even as small as 10,000 if we can get away with it) so really he just wants me to handle it for now, and if it's successful we'd probably swap into something bigger as a platform later if we need to. Anyways, does anyone know basic platforms that would be great for this purpose? It seems silly to do something like WeBull for an LLC, but if that is a recommendation, we could do that. 

The portfolio type is very basic, likely no more than 15 different companies held at a time, with 3 month rebalancing.

* Ryan Cohen was appointed the company’s CEO, president and chairman and won’t receive compensation for his work.
* The move comes more than three months after GameStop fired then-CEO Matthew Furlong.
* Shares of GameStop surged after the announcement.

GameStop said Thursday morning that billionaire activist investor Ryan Cohen would take over as the video game retailer’s chief executive, chairman and president effective immediately — and he won’t be collecting a salary.

Shares of the company jumped more than 6% in premarket trading following the announcement.

GameStop’s board, with Cohen abstaining, unanimously voted to appoint the entrepreneur as the retailer’s top executive on Wednesday. Cohen had previously held the title of executive chairman but will step down from the role upon his latest appointment, according to a securities filing.

Cohen won’t “receive any compensation” for his work, a news release said.

The move comes more than three months after GameStop fired CEO Matthew Furlong, made Cohen executive chairman and appointed longtime company soldier Mark Robinson as its “principal executive officer” and general manager. GameStop didn’t give a reason for Furlong’s dismissal at the time, but it came just months after the company had reported its first quarterly profit in two years with Furlong at the helm.

Several weeks later, the company announced that CFO Diana Saadeh-Jajeh was resigning.

With the latest move, Cohen will also assume the role of principal executive officer from Robinson. He previously served as general counsel and secretary, and he added principal executive officer to his list of duties back in June. Now, he will resume as just general counsel and secretary, according to a securities filing.

Cohen, who founded pet food retailer Chewy

and has become known as the “king” of meme stocks, bought a stake in GameStop in 2020 and joined the board in 2021 – during the height of the meme phenomenon.

As of late June, his firm RC Ventures was GameStop’s largest shareholder with a 12.09% stake, according to FactSet.

Since Cohen joined the company, the business hasn’t shown many signs of a turnaround, albeit with some exceptions. Earlier this month, GameStop reported its second-quarter financial results, posting a narrower loss than it did a year ago, as well as a slight increase in revenue.

DETROIT – The United Auto Workers union will announce expanded strikes at General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis plants if the sides don’t make significant progress in negotiations by 10 a.m. ET Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The new union-imposed deadline comes a week after the UAW announced it would expand its initial Sept. 15 strikes at assembly plants of each of the Detroit automakers to 38 additional parts and distribution locations for GM and Stellantis. The UAW did not expand its strikes at Ford, citing progress in those talks.

Like a week earlier, it’s expected that UAW President Shawn Fain will host a Facebook Live event to announce which plants will walk out at noon Friday, barring progress in the talks.

The strikes currently involve about 18,300 workers, or 12.5% of the UAW’s 146,000 members whose labor contracts expired on Sept. 14.

Fain previously said the union planned to increase the work stoppages, based on how negotiations with the companies were going. It’s calling the work stoppages “stand-up strikes,” a nod to historic “sit-down” strikes by the UAW in the 1930s.

Spokespeople for the Detroit automakers did not immediately respond for comment Wednesday.

The additional strike plans come despite record contract offers from the automakers that include roughly 20% hourly wage increases, thousands of dollars in bonuses, retention of the union’s platinum health care and other sweetened benefits.

The union’s new deadline comes a day after President Joe Biden joined Fain and union members, becoming the first-known sitting president to walk a picket line with striking auto workers. The commander-in-chief also voiced support for the union and its demands, including a 40% wage increase during the life of the contract.

The UAW has further demanded a shortened workweek, a shift back to traditional pensions, the elimination of compensation tiers and a restoration of cost-of-living adjustments, among other improvements.

Unlike past strikes, UAW leaders opted for targeted strikes at select plants instead of initiating national walkouts at the plants.

The strategy is in an effort to keep the automakers on edge and assist in pitting them against one another to achieve the best contracts for union members, according to private messages leaked last week involving UAW communications director Jonah Furman.

The messages, which described a strategy to cause “recurring reputations damage and operational chaos” for the companies, were heavily criticized by the automakers.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/27/uaw-threatens-to-expand-strikes-again-at-gm-ford-stellantis.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/27/uaw-threatens-to-expand-strikes-again-at-gm-ford-stellantis.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a week earlier, it’s expected that UAW President Shawn Fain will host a Facebook Live event to announce which plants will walk out at noon Friday, barring progress in the talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strikes currently involve about 18,300 workers, or 12.5% of the UAW’s 146,000 members whose labor contracts expired on Sept. 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fain previously said the union planned to increase the work stoppages, based on how negotiations with the companies were going. It’s calling the work stoppages “stand-up strikes,” a nod to historic “sit-down” strikes by the UAW in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for the Detroit automakers did not immediately respond for comment Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The additional strike plans come despite record contract offers from the automakers that include roughly 20% hourly wage increases, thousands of dollars in bonuses, retention of the union’s platinum health care and other sweetened benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The union’s new deadline comes a day after President Joe Biden joined Fain and union members, becoming the first-known sitting president to walk a picket line with striking auto workers. The commander-in-chief also voiced support for the union and its demands, including a 40% wage increase during the life of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAW has further demanded a shortened workweek, a shift back to traditional pensions, the elimination of compensation tiers and a restoration of cost-of-living adjustments, among other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike past strikes, UAW leaders opted for targeted strikes at select plants instead of initiating national walkouts at the plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy is in an effort to keep the automakers on edge and assist in pitting them against one another to achieve the best contracts for union members, according to private messages leaked last week involving UAW communications director Jonah Furman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The messages, which described a strategy to cause “recurring reputations damage and operational chaos” for the companies, were heavily criticized by the automakers.&lt;/p&gt;

* Amazon is facing its first set of antitrust charges from the U.S. federal government after the Federal Trade Commission filed its long-anticipated lawsuit against the e-commerce and cloud giant.
* The lawsuit is a major milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who rose to prominence for her 2017 Yale Law Journal note, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.”
* It’s also the culmination of several years of pressure on federal enforcers to deal with what some competitors, sellers and lawmakers have seen as anticompetitive practices. 


The Federal Trade Commission has filed its long-anticipated antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.

In a sweeping complaint unveiled Tuesday, the FTC and attorneys general from 17 states accused Amazon of wielding its “monopoly power” to inflate prices, degrade quality for shoppers and unlawfully exclude rivals, thereby undermining competition.

The agency laid out a two-pronged strategy by which Amazon “unlawfully maintains” its monopoly power. It pointed to so-called anti-discounting measures the company uses to punish sellers and deter other online retailers from offering lower, more competitive prices than Amazon, which translates to keeping prices higher for products across the internet, the FTC said.

Amazon also “effectively requires” that sellers use its “costly” fulfillment services in order to obtain the vaunted Prime badge for their products, the FTC said, which in turn makes it more expensive to do business on the platform.

These tactics have degraded the shopping experience on Amazon, the FTC added, and forced sellers to pay expensive fees to market their goods on the site, while facing no other choice “but to rely on Amazon to stay in business.”

The lawsuit is a major milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who rose to prominence for her 2017 Yale Law Journal note, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” Khan argued in the article that the prominent antitrust framework at the time failed to capture the true extent of Amazon’s dominance and potential harm to competition. Through her work at the FTC, Khan has sought to reset that framework and push the boundaries of antitrust law through risky legal battles.

Amazon sought Khan’s recusal from antitrust investigations into its business, arguing that her past writing and critiques showed she had prejudged the outcome of such probes.

The charges are the culmination of several years of pressure on federal enforcers to deal with what some competitors, sellers and lawmakers saw as anticompetitive practices. Amazon was one of four Big Tech companies investigated by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, which found it held monopoly power over most of its third-party sellers and many suppliers. The majority Democratic staff at the time alleged that Amazon shored up “competitive moats” by acquiring rival sites like Diapers.com and Zappos.

At the time, an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement that “large companies are not dominant by definition, and the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behavior is simply wrong.”

Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has transformed from an online bookseller into a retail, advertising and cloud computing giant with a staggering market valuation of roughly $1.4 trillion. The company has sought to expand its dominance by entering verticals like health care, streaming, and grocery, acquiring primary care provider One Medical, legendary film and television studio MGM, and upscale supermarket chain Whole Foods.

Those moves have attracted intense regulatory scrutiny. The House subcommittee report also accused Amazon of abusing its position in online retail to harm third-party merchants who rely on the platform to sell goods, and alleged it uses “strong-arm tactics” to bully retail partners. The FTC is also reviewing Amazon’s planned $1.7 billion acquisition of Roomba maker iRobot

on antitrust grounds. Amazon recently paid roughly $30 million to settle two privacy lawsuits brought by the FTC concerning its Ring doorbell and Alexa units. The agency followed up in June with a lawsuit accusing Amazon of tricking users into signing up for Prime,  while making it too difficult for them to cancel.

Amazon’s marketplace has transformed into a linchpin of its e-commerce business since its launch in 2000. The company had already expanded beyond its origins as a bookseller to offering things like CDs and videos. But once it opened its doors to third-party sellers, it supercharged the number and variety of products for sale on its website, earning it the moniker “the everything store.”

The third-party marketplace has given Amazon access to a higher-margin business than just selling books.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon is facing its first set of antitrust charges from the U.S. federal government after the Federal Trade Commission filed its long-anticipated lawsuit against the e-commerce and cloud giant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lawsuit is a major milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who rose to prominence for her 2017 Yale Law Journal note, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s also the culmination of several years of pressure on federal enforcers to deal with what some competitors, sellers and lawmakers have seen as anticompetitive practices. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission has filed its long-anticipated antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sweeping complaint unveiled Tuesday, the FTC and attorneys general from 17 states accused Amazon of wielding its “monopoly power” to inflate prices, degrade quality for shoppers and unlawfully exclude rivals, thereby undermining competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency laid out a two-pronged strategy by which Amazon “unlawfully maintains” its monopoly power. It pointed to so-called anti-discounting measures the company uses to punish sellers and deter other online retailers from offering lower, more competitive prices than Amazon, which translates to keeping prices higher for products across the internet, the FTC said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon also “effectively requires” that sellers use its “costly” fulfillment services in order to obtain the vaunted Prime badge for their products, the FTC said, which in turn makes it more expensive to do business on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tactics have degraded the shopping experience on Amazon, the FTC added, and forced sellers to pay expensive fees to market their goods on the site, while facing no other choice “but to rely on Amazon to stay in business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is a major milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who rose to prominence for her 2017 Yale Law Journal note, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” Khan argued in the article that the prominent antitrust framework at the time failed to capture the true extent of Amazon’s dominance and potential harm to competition. Through her work at the FTC, Khan has sought to reset that framework and push the boundaries of antitrust law through risky legal battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon sought Khan’s recusal from antitrust investigations into its business, arguing that her past writing and critiques showed she had prejudged the outcome of such probes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charges are the culmination of several years of pressure on federal enforcers to deal with what some competitors, sellers and lawmakers saw as anticompetitive practices. Amazon was one of four Big Tech companies investigated by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, which found it held monopoly power over most of its third-party sellers and many suppliers. The majority Democratic staff at the time alleged that Amazon shored up “competitive moats” by acquiring rival sites like Diapers.com and Zappos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement that “large companies are not dominant by definition, and the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behavior is simply wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has transformed from an online bookseller into a retail, advertising and cloud computing giant with a staggering market valuation of roughly $1.4 trillion. The company has sought to expand its dominance by entering verticals like health care, streaming, and grocery, acquiring primary care provider One Medical, legendary film and television studio MGM, and upscale supermarket chain Whole Foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those moves have attracted intense regulatory scrutiny. The House subcommittee report also accused Amazon of abusing its position in online retail to harm third-party merchants who rely on the platform to sell goods, and alleged it uses “strong-arm tactics” to bully retail partners. The FTC is also reviewing Amazon’s planned $1.7 billion acquisition of Roomba maker iRobot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on antitrust grounds. Amazon recently paid roughly $30 million to settle two privacy lawsuits brought by the FTC concerning its Ring doorbell and Alexa units. The agency followed up in June with a lawsuit accusing Amazon of tricking users into signing up for Prime,  while making it too difficult for them to cancel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s marketplace has transformed into a linchpin of its e-commerce business since its launch in 2000. The company had already expanded beyond its origins as a bookseller to offering things like CDs and videos. But once it opened its doors to third-party sellers, it supercharged the number and variety of products for sale on its website, earning it the moniker “the everything store.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third-party marketplace has given Amazon access to a higher-margin business than just selling books. It has also increased the fees it charges sellers to do business on its site, run advertisements, and tap into its fulfillment and delivery services. In the first half of 2023, the company collected a 45% cut of every sale made by sellers in the U.S., up from 19% in 2014, according to the nonprofit Institute for Local Self Reliance. Sales from third-party sellers now comprise 60% of total units sold, the company recently disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I also have a (fairly conservative) dummy portfolio I am checking the performance of the advisor with. After 2.5 years, I&amp;#39;m consistently beating them even after ignoring their 1% fee. After about 18 months of beating them, I figured it must be a fluke, so I set up ANOTHER dummy portfolio with the asset values on that day and completely different picks by me and I&amp;#39;m beating them with that one too. &lt;/p&gt;

Generally I don't go this far out on options so I'm wondering what the consensus play is here. 

My thought is to let decay eat into the short side and try to buy it out somewhere between $10-$15 in the next 6 months. Then hope that tesla pops before 1/19/26. Even if it doesn't get to 510 I would be ITM anything over $45 on the long call

Risk being a tesla pop pre 12/26/25 and then subsequent crash that would leave me upside down on both legs if I sell out individuals. 

Or I could sell now for $53, or ride it out and risk the $100 for $2700. 

My portfolio can handle a moderate amount of risk. As long as I buy out the short side first and sell the long side before it absolutely dies, losing 3k wouldn't be the end of the world. More just like my 1 stupid gamble for 2023/4

181,stocks,"*America Has a Long-Term Labor Crisis*

&gt;Offshoring, the scourge of the U.S. manufacturing workforce in the last decades of the 20th century, has lost favor with some business leaders after the pandemic highlighted the vulnerabilities of a global supply chain. Reshoring—bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.—is gathering momentum, backed by billions of dollars in government subsidies.

&gt;That leaves immigration. After falling during the pandemic because of Covid-related policies, immigration has come back strongly. But it remains a divisive issue, and business leaders say the lack of a coherent, stable policy is contributing to the labor problem.  

&gt;“If we don’t solve this with a thoughtful immigration program, we’re going to drive wage rates through the roof in the next two to three years because of the systemic shortfall of labor at the end of the day,” Fish said.

The U.S. economy has been running, improbably, with an unemployment rate under 4% for nearly two years. 

That isn’t just a holdover from pandemic bottlenecks, when employers let millions of people go and then struggled to find workers when demand roared back, economists and business leaders say. It is a storm that has been brewing for decades, flaring up most recently in the form of worker strikes at automakers and airlines. Labor shortages are turning into a long-term labor crisis that could push wages and turnover higher. 

Work experts have warned for years that the combination of baby boomer retirements, low birthrates, shifting immigration policies and changing worker preferences is leaving U.S. employers with too few workers to fill job openings. While the labor market is softening, none of those factors are expected to change dramatically in the coming years.

“It is a talent supply chain and you have to think about it that way, except in this case, talent has a choice,” said Teresa Carroll, chief executive of Magnit, a firm that manages temp, contract and freelance workers for companies. Workers are choosing arrangements such as part-time, flexible or remote work, prompting employers to adapt to fill roles.

Total employment will grow about 0.3% a year until 2032, the Labor Department recently projected, much slower than the 1.2% rate over the past decade, largely because of population constraints. That will contribute to slower growth in gross domestic product, the agency said.

The baby boomers were the largest generation of Americans, with 76 million children born between 1946 and 1964. They currently range in age from 58 to 77. By the end of 2028, even the youngest living baby boomers will have reached the average retirement age of approximately 64. 

The next largest generation, millennials, numbered 62 million births in the U.S. from 1981 to 1996, per the Pew Research Center, but has grown because of immigration. 

Baby boomers, who had been on a steady trend of working more years, pulled back during the pandemic. Many retired and haven’t returned.

The U.S. birthrate—the number of births per 1,000 people—has been falling for decades, declining by about half since the 1960s.

The share of people living in the U.S. who are in the labor force peaked at 67.3% in the first three months of 2000, when the oldest baby boomers were 54 years old and the youngest were 35. It helped that the U.S. was in the midst of an economic expansion, the first dot-com boom.

Participation hasn’t fully recovered from pandemic-era losses, though there have been signs of growth for prime-age workers—those between ages 25 and 54. The overall participation rate is expected to drop to 60.4% in 2032, according to the Labor Department, mainly because of baby boomer retirements.

Wages reflect supply and demand. They shot up during the pandemic recovery and have recently outpaced inflation, which gives workers more spending power. Long-term labor shortages could lead to a faster pace of wage growth for the foreseeable future. 

John Fish, chairman and CEO of construction contractor Suffolk, said an aging workforce and fewer young people entering the industry are a combustible combination. “A carpenter now is making 20% to 25% more than they did 24 months ago, and that is not sustainable.”

**Filling the Void**

Labor shortages can be eased by funneling more people into the labor force or making the current workforce more productive. That can be done through immigration; outsourcing more work overseas; tapping underutilized labor pools such as people with disabilities and the formerly incarcerated; and improving productivity through automation, training and refining business and production processes.

Companies and countries have three options when it comes to managing a shortfall of workers, said Magnit’s Carroll. “They can plan for it, they can do nothing, or they can have hope. And to me, hope is not a strategy.”

As a general rule, an economy is able to grow about as quickly as its workforce expands, plus any gains in how productive the workforce is. Productivity is difficult to measure, and in the past few years, the numbers have been muddled by shocks from the pandemic. Overall, productivity growth has been mostly lackluster, rising about 1.4% a year over the past decade.

Currently - doing research

The past - Observing massive media doom going back to pre-2016. The message on 8 year old YouTube videos from CNBC etc = doom. 

The past in reality - massive, unprecedented, unpredicted growth. Growth so delicious that ETF boom occurs. 

Present - uncertainty is identical to past 8+ years. Narrative is the same

Future - the truth as I see it, as an outsider, as a complete noob = overpopulation -&gt;

World overpopulation is the reason the market can’t stop, won’t stop. These aren’t bubbles. The bubbles you’re seeing are new investors in the US, India, everywhere.

330 million in America = inevitably more investors. 8 billion worldwide. People exiting the third world in South America due to Lithium alone will be huge. Continent of Africa has barely begun industrialization.

We, as ignorant new investors don’t know anything but buy. African new money = buy. India buy. USA buy. Unemployment low, more retirement accounts = buy. As noobs, we don’t even know we are bulls. Buy VOO? Sure. Nvidia, makes sense. Noobs buy.

Look at housing market, 65 million new homes predicted in USA. 1% of housing market currently for sale = overpopulation. Endless growth. 

5 trillion in ETF’s? Go ahead and short that bubble. But will there be 50 trillion in ETF’s by 2030? 

Yup. Because of overpopulation. The answer is always overpopulation. Going forward humans are literal compound interest as 8 billion grows and grows and grows. 

There are so many people visiting Venice that it sinks WHILE tourists are there, and rises when they leave. Google any location, too many people, too many tourists not enough houses, schools, not enough condos, hotels

&lt;p&gt;The past - Observing massive media doom going back to pre-2016. The message on 8 year old YouTube videos from CNBC etc = doom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past in reality - massive, unprecedented, unpredicted growth. Growth so delicious that ETF boom occurs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present - uncertainty is identical to past 8+ years. Narrative is the same&lt;/p&gt;

188,stocks,"* Deal, which still has to be ratified by members, could open the door to an agreement with the Screen Actors Guild
* Hollywood writers, studios and streamers said Sunday that they have reached a tentative agreement that would end a monthslong strike.
* The new three-year deal includes several hard-fought victories for the writers including increased royalties, mandatory staffing for television “writing rooms” and protections regarding the use of artificial intelligence, people familiar with the pact said.
* Could lead pathway to resume content creation, create more certainty and lift the following tickers: DIS, WBD, CMCSA, PARA, NFLX

Neither side would address the terms of the accord. The Writers Guild of America said it is still finalizing the memorandum of agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, a coalition representing movie and TV studios, networks and streamers. The negotiating committee will then vote on whether to recommend it and send the contract forward for approval.

Until that happens, writers have been instructed not to return to work by the WGA. However, that both sides are acknowledging a deal after months of contentious negotiations is seen as the beginning of the end of the strike.

Both sides agreed to terms just after reaching a self-imposed deadline of Sunday evening before the start of the Yom Kippur holiday.

The deal comes after five consecutive days of talks that involved Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Disney CEO Bob Iger, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos and NBCUniversal Studios Group Chairman Donna Langley.

A resolution to the writers’ strike could open the door to a deal with the Screen Actors Guild, the performers’ union that has been on strike since mid-July. It marked the first time both unions went on strike since 1960.

Getting both strikes resolved could salvage at least some of the 2023-24 television season and the summer movie season. Typically in television it takes at least two months of outlining and writing episodes before production starts.

The WGA went on strike May 2, closing writing rooms industrywide. The strike quickly shut down late-night TV shows and stalled work on scripted television shows and films. Members of the union, which represents 11,500 writers, mobilized to form picket lines outside productions with finished scripts to disrupt those shoots.

The Los Angeles economy has been severely hurt by the strike: A spate of productions ground to a halt, and thousands of other Hollywood workers dependent on the industry for their livelihoods have been sitting on the sidelines. The Milken Institute has projected the hit to California’s economy to be in the billions. Other states feeling the pinch from the shutdown include Georgia and New Mexico.

Among the WGA’s demands were a minimum number of writers per television show and guaranteed employment for those writers from conception to postproduction. They also wanted additional residuals from streaming programs and more transparency around how streaming shows fared with viewers.

The use of artificial intelligence and the staffing mandates were particularly difficult areas to find common ground. The studios and streamers were initially against any mandatory staffing, and their unwillingness to negotiate on that point was one of the key reasons talks never really gained any traction last spring.

In recent weeks, the Alliance gave ground on the staffing issues as well as exploring the idea of changing formulas for streaming residuals that would reward success more than the current model.

While a tentative agreement is good news, the strike has already done a lot of damage to the industry. Movie studios began delaying major film releases, networks changed fall prime-time lineups, and entertainment companies put talent deals on hold. Some executives began questioning the viability of the 2023-2024 television season and planned theatrical releases early next year if the strike dragged on into October.

Negotiations between the WGA and AMPTP initially restarted on Aug. 11, which gave some in the industry hope that the dispute would soon be resolved. Those talks stalled, and relations between the two sides grew nastier.

The AMPTP in late August made public its latest offer to striking writers. The WGA criticized the offer and the AMPTP’s decision to make it public, which some viewed as an attempt to undermine the union’s hold on its membership.

In early September, some top showrunners reached out to the union to express concern about the lack of negotiations, which put more pressure on the WGA to get back to the table. “Shameless” producer John Wells, “Riverdale” producer Greg Berlanti and Ryan Murphy, whose credits include “Dahmer—Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” were among those showrunners, the Journal previously reported.

Around that time, daytime talk show host Drew Barrymore and HBO’s Bill Maher said they planned to resume shooting so that their staff could work, but reversed the decisions after industry backlash.

In a statement, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists applauded the tentative pact.

“SAG-AFTRA congratulates the WGA on reaching a tentative agreement with the AMPTP after 146 days of incredible strength, resiliency and solidarity on the picket lines,” the statement said. “While we look forward to reviewing the WGA and AMPTP’s tentative agreement, we remain committed to achieving the necessary terms for our members.”

While the WGA talks have been the primary focus of the AMPTP, there have been some talks with the actors guild in the hopes of wrapping up a deal as quickly as possible, people close to the Alliance said.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

193,stocks,"Dear Redditors,

I have a question for those of you with experience investing in stock markets of developing countries. Perhaps you reside in one of these countries and possess firsthand experience in your day trading activities. Specifically, I'm referring to countries grappling with significant inflation rates and erratic currency fluctuations. How do you perceive investing in stocks in such countries in terms of risk assessment, ranging from mild to a stay-away level?

For instance, the Argentine Peso experienced a consistent increase in exchange rates from January to mid-August, going from approximately 180 to about 280. During the same period, the MARVEL index surged from around 200k to roughly 550k, representing a gain of about 175%. However, the devaluation of the currency by the government from approximately 280 to about 350 after mid-August was far from favorable.

A similar scenario unfolded in Turkey. From July to almost the end of September, the currency depreciated from 25.80 to 27.20, indicating a 5% loss in its value. Conversely, the BIST index witnessed an upward trend, rising from about 6k to roughly 8.2k, marking a 36% increase.

In both these countries, one can observe a pattern in the exchange rate behavior where it remains steady for a while, experiences sudden spikes, plateaus, and then stabilizes for a period before spiking again. It's as if the government decides to adjust the bar a little higher one morning while sipping their coffee—of course, the reality is more complex. The point is the highly unpredictable nature of the risks involved. How do investors manage these risks in such countries?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Redditors,&lt;/p&gt;

195,stocks,"E-commerce giant Amazon on Monday said it will invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic and take a minority ownership position in the company.The move underscores Amazon’s aggressive AI push as it looks to keep pace with rivals such as Microsoft and Alphabet’sGoogle.

Anthropic was founded roughly two years ago by former OpenAI research executives and recently debuted its new AI chatbot called Claude 2. Amazon is looking to capitalize on the hype and promise of so-called generative AI, which includes technology like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as well as Anthropic’s Claude chatbots.

The two firms on Monday said that they are forming a strategic collaboration to advance generative AI, with the startup selecting Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. Anthropic said it will provide AWS customers with early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning capabilities.

Anthropic will also use custom AWS-designed semiconductors to train the foundational models that underpin its AI applications. Foundation models are large AI programs trained on vast amounts of data so that they can be adapted to solve a wide range of tasks. 

This year, chip firm Nvidia is the chip firm that has seen the biggest gains from the generative AI boom. Nvidia’s key product is a type of semiconductor known as a graphics processing unit, which can be used to train huge AI models. At one point Nvidia’s stock had rallied more than 200%, as the company smashed through financial forecasts on the rising adoption of AI.

To an extent, Amazon’s deal with Anthropic aims to show that there are alternative chips that can be used for AI applications. AWS customers will be able to build on Anthropic’s AI models via Amazon Bedrock — a service that lets customers build generative AI applications in the cloud via existing models, rather than train their own models.

Amazon is looking to position itself as the one-stop shop for AI. The e-commerce giant designs its own chips for training huge AI models. Through Amazon Bedrock customers can also design their own generative AI applications using existing models, which are all run on the Amazon cloud. The company sells its own AI applications too.

Anthropic already counts some high-profile backers, including Google and Salesforce Ventures. This support comes as tech giants continue to make massive bets on AI companies, a move sparked by Microsoft’s multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI in January.

196,stocks,"The stock of PepsiCo is up year to date, exceeding Coca-Cola, but behind the S&amp;P 500. With a solid business strategy, PepsiCo continually grows sales and profits while responding to shifting consumer behaviour. They are ideally situated to expand in the years to come. Future growth is fueled by the omnichannel strategy, which also incorporates e-commerce and away-from-home activities, the previously mentioned brand adaptability, and the pep+ plan. For instance, 53% of beverages are sugar-reduced. Targets for reducing salt have been met by 66% of convenient foods. This is consistent with customer ""zeitgeist"" and might encourage brand loyalty.  
Unfortunately, the stock price has already factored in a significant portion of the expected earnings. As a result, the adjusted PE ratio would still be higher than 20 based on an adjusted EPS of $8.74 in 2025. But PepsiCo stock has never been inexpensive, so investors hoping for significant price drops are probably better off staying away from the market for good. Only the extreme Corona crisis crash in the previous five years experienced a greater share price loss than the current one. Pepsi's adjusted P/E ratio for the past 15 years has hovered around 20.5, which is high for a company with a very cautious growth strategy. The valuation is considerably more pricey right now, at 25. The P/C ratio and the current dividend yield both fit this description.  
Although Pepsi is a superb firm with fantastic global brands, its price is still high. Pepsi is on my radar as an investment if there is any additional weakness, even though it is still pricey.

208,stocks,"**Company Overview**  
  
Brady Corporation makes identification solutions and workplace safety products. This includes a variety of products such as RF tags, barcode scanners, identity labeling, and safety signs. Their products are used in warehouse automation, building security, hospitals, and other industrial buildings. The company goes back to 1914, and still has members of the founding family on the board of directors. By the 2000s the company had grown stagnant. In 2014 they brought in a new CEO and began to turn the company around.The company has a $2.7 billion market cap, is trading at 15.8x earnings, and 2x sales. They made $657 million of profit on $1.33 billion in sales last year. 
  
Brady’s products fill various niches. For example, in the hospital you now get a barcode bracelet that gets scanned prior to administering medicine. Chances are, that system was made by Brady. They also make RF readers and labels for automation. Generally they make a lot of products people use, but don’t think about. They also have building security and access controls, something that will, sadly, continue to be a necessity going forward.  
  
**Management**  
  
The current CEO is Russell Shaller. He has been with the company since 2015 and CEO since 2022. He has a degree in electrical engineering and keeps the company on a technological focus. Insiders own over 3% of the company.   
  
**Mine Safety Disclosures**  
  
None  
  
**Growth Strategy**  
  
Since 2014 the company has been turning itself around. It reports primarily in GAAP earnings, as opposed to previous vague accounting. They started increasing R&amp;D spending and eventually sales spending. At the time, the company had negative growth, but by 2018 revenues and earnings started to increase. They view industrial automation as their best growth market and have been adding software applications to compliment their RF technology. From their most recent 10K:  
  
 *“Our strategy for growth includes an increased focus on certain industries and products, streamlining our product offerings, expanding into higher growth end-markets, improving the overall customer experience, developing technologically advanced, innovative and proprietary products, and improving our digital capabilities.”*  
  
The company continues to allocate 4.% of sales to its R&amp;D budget and growing. This is up from  3.2% in 2016 (on increased revenues). They view it as a priority to develop new and innovative products to continue to grow the business. They have also been improving the company cost structure, as evidenced by their profit margins. Their net margins have improved from -13% in 2013 to +13% in their latest filings. Management continues to look for ways to lower SG&amp;A expenses.  
  
The company also engages in acquisitions, historically doing about 1 per year. They finance this with cash flows, as opposed to debt. Having diverse end markets helps BRC to weather downturns. No customer makes up more than 10% of their business.  
  
**Balance sheet and efficiency**   
  
BRC has a stellar balance sheet, with a net cash position. They pay a dividend, which has increased every year for 34 years. They also use their cash flows to buyback shares, last year reducing share count by 3.45%. The total shareholder yield (dividend &amp; buybacks) is just over 5%.  
  
BRC boasts a ROIC of 16.7%, which has increased almost every year since 2014 when they had negative returns. Their gross margins are 49.4% and net profit margins are 13%. The company has used all this to grow EPS at a 15% CAGR for the last 5 years.  
  
**Risks**  
  
EPS has grown much faster than revenues, which only have a 5 year CAGR of 2.56%. Brady is investing into growing their sales force, and anticipates being able to grow sales faster than GDP growth. If they are not able to continue their increasing efficiency, it is possible their EPS growth will slow.  
  
Almost half of the company’s business is done overseas, so they are subject to exchange rate fluctuations. They have also experienced supply chain issues during the last few years, though these appear to be normalizing.  
  
**Valuation &amp; Technicals**  
  
BRC has a 5 year average P/E ratio of 20.07, P/B of 2.84, and P/FCF of 16.6. Currently its trading at a P/E of 15.89, P/B of 2.72, and P/FCF of 13.3.  
  
Given that all its metrics are below its historical norms, the stock is likely slightly undervalued.   
  
Morningstar has a Q value of $59.37 vs its current trading price of $55.77, which backs up that theory. Guru focus has a fair value of $55.86.  
  
The stock is trading right at strong resistance of $56, where it has been since it announced earnings in August. I would wait until the stock moved up or down before buying. Picking up shares at $52 or even $48 would provide an extra margin of safety. 

**Conclusions**

In my opinion, Brady corporation is a company that has a lot of niche products that support growing fields. Medical care, security, and automation are areas with secular tailwinds. This is in the package of a company trading at low multiples and has a great history of returning cash to shareholders. BRC does not receive a lot of coverage (only 2 analysts cover it) and has quietly built a solid, growing, and durable business.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

ADBE actually did pretty good these past month relative to other tech companies (excluding Nvidia). I suspect this might be due to its new features involving AI like the generative fill took in photoshop. I work in VFX and it is frankly quite incredible. I see new innovations in Image creation with AI, most recently the one where you can costumize text or shapes that the AI replicates, that can be implemented in the future. After effects is also benefiting from AI with their roto rush tool. Adobe is a company that actually currently offers something tangible with AI. 

So my question is, are there other public media creation companies that could potentially offer stuff using AI in the near future? Nvidia is offering new ways to raytrace and generate 3d environments, but I'm seeking  companies other than NVIDIA and ADOBE.

For example, if you take a look at two minute papers, the text to video is progressing pretty fast. I'm particularly surprised by how good the particle simulation is advancing, which may eventually be an viable option for particle/smoke effects rather than using houdini.

&gt;Credit card companies are racking up losses at the fastest pace in almost 30 years, outside of the Great Financial Crisis, according to Goldman Sachs. Credit card losses bottomed in September 2021, and while initial increases were likely reversals from stimulus, they have been rapidly rising since the first quarter of 2022. Since that time, it’s an increasing rate of losses only seen in recent history during the recession of 2008. It is far from over, the firm predicts.

&gt;Losses currently stand at 3.63%, up 1.5 percentage points from the bottom, and Goldman sees them rising another 1.3 percentage points to 4.93%. This comes at a time when Americans owe more than $1 trillion on credit cards, a record high, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. “We think delinquencies could continue to underperform seasonality through the middle of next year and don’t see losses peaking until late 2024 / early 2025 for most issuers,” analyst Ryan Nash wrote in a note Friday.

&gt;What is unusual is that the losses are accelerating outside of an economic downturn, he pointed out. Of the past five credit card loss cycles, three were characterized by recessions, he said. The two that occurred when the economy was not in a recession were in the mid ’90s and 2015 to 2019, Nash said. He used history as a guide to determine further losses. “In our view, this cycle resembles the characteristics of what was experienced in the late 1990s and somewhat similar to the ’15 to ’19 cycle where losses increase following a period of strong loan growth and has seen similar pace of normalization thus far this cycle,” Nash said. History also shows that losses tend to peak six to eight quarters after loan growth peaks, he said. That implies the credit normalization cycle is only at its halfway point, hence the late 2024, early 2025 prediction, he said. Nash sees the most downside risk for Capital One Financial, followed by Discover Financial Services

228,stocks,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/22/mcdonalds-to-raise-royalty-fees-for-new-franchised-restaurants.html

* McDonald’s franchise royalty fees for U.S. restaurants will rise from 4% to 5% for operators opening new locations.
* The fast-food giant hasn’t hiked royalty fees in nearly three decades.
* While the change won’t affect many operators initially, backlash will likely come, due to the company’s rocky relationship with its U.S. franchisees.

McDonald’s franchisees who add new restaurants will soon have to pay higher royalty fees.

The fast-food giant is raising those fees from 4% to 5%, starting Jan. 1. It’s the first time in nearly three decades that McDonald’s is hiking its royalty fees.

The change will not affect existing franchisees who are maintaining their current footprint or who buy a franchised location from another operator. It will also not apply to rebuilt existing locations or restaurants transferred between family members.

However, the higher rate will affect new franchisees, buyers of company-owned restaurants, relocated restaurants and other scenarios that involve the franchisor.

“While we created the industry we now lead, we must continue to redefine what success looks like and position ourselves for long-term success to ensure the value of our brand remains as strong as ever,” McDonald’s U.S. President Joe Erlinger said in a message to U.S. franchisees viewed by CNBC.

McDonald’s will also stop calling the payments “service fees,” and instead use the term “royalty fees,” which most franchisors favor.

“We’re not changing services, but we are trying to change the mindset by getting people to see and understand the power of what you buy into when you buy the McDonald’s brand, the McDonald’s system,” Erlinger told CNBC.

Franchisees run about 95% of McDonald’s roughly 13,400 U.S. restaurants. They pay rent, monthly royalty fees and other charges, such as annual fees toward the company’s mobile app, in order to operate as part of McDonald’s system.

The royalty fee hikes probably won’t affect many franchisees right away. However, backlash will likely come, due to the company’s rocky relationship with its U.S. operators.

McDonald’s and its franchisees have clashed over a number of issues in recent years, including a new assessment system for restaurants and a California bill that will hike wages for fast-food workers by 25% next year.

In the second quarter, McDonald’s franchisees rated their relationship with corporate management at a 1.71 out of 5, in a quarterly survey of several dozen of the chain’s operators conducted by Kalinowski Equity Research. It’s the survey’s highest mark since the fourth quarter of 2021, but still a far cry from the potential high score of 5.

Despite the turmoil, McDonald’s U.S. business is booming. In its most recent quarter, domestic same-store sales grew 10.3%. Promotions such as the Grimace Birthday Meal and strong demand for McDonald’s core menu items, such as Big Macs and McNuggets, fueled sales.

Franchisee cash flows rose year over year as a result, McDonald’s CFO Ian Borden said in late July. The company said average cash flows for U.S. operators have climbed 35% over the last five years.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/22/mcdonalds-to-raise-royalty-fees-for-new-franchised-restaurants.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/22/mcdonalds-to-raise-royalty-fees-for-new-franchised-restaurants.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Bankrupt home goods retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond  (BBBY) - Get Free Report has released a new document, which a court has approved. The ""Plan"" outlines the actions to be taken regarding the company and its assets as part of its bankruptcy proceeding.

The Plan primarily involves a controlled winding down of the company's operations and the transfer of its assets to the ""Wind-Down Debtors.""

According to the most recent financial information, the company still has $42.4 million in total assets and a significant debt of approximately $1.5 million.

According to the plan, there were 782 million outstanding BBBYQ common shares on July 20.

The Plan clarifies that all these shares will be effectively canceled and no longer have any value once it takes effect. This is expected to occur ""on or about"" September 30.

Put simply, the company's shareholders will be left with absolutely nothing — not a dime.

**Could Cohen Get Involved (Again)?**

Surprisingly, even though the funeral date for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond appears to be set, some shareholders are holding out hope for a last-minute savior who could turn the company's fortunes around.

There's speculation that Ryan Cohen, GameStop's  (GME) - Get Free Report executive chair and an erstwhile investor in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, might make a new investment in the company. This optimism has pushed BBBYQ up by nearly 30% in the last five days.

However, the situation involving Cohen and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is far from ideal.

According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking into Cohen's ownership of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares and his unexpected decision to sell them.

Back in March 2022, Cohen announced that he had acquired a nearly 10% stake in the retailer. He mentioned that he was urging the company to explore different options, including going private.

However, in August of the same year, a regulatory filing revealed that Cohen bailed on his Bed Bath &amp; Beyond position when the stock made an impressive rally.

The SEC is reportedly seeking details from Cohen about his trades and his conversations with top executives at the now-defunct home goods retailer.

They've also requested records from some of the company's past and present board members, according to sources familiar with the matter. (Cohen appointed three members to the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond board and replaced its then-CEO, Mark Tritton.)

Cohen's legal troubles aren't limited to the SEC investigation. He's also facing a class-action lawsuit led by Belgian investment firm Bratya SPRL. The suit alleges that Cohen engaged in a ""pump and dump"" scheme involving his Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares.

The suit also claims that Cohen collaborated with former Bed Bath &amp; Beyond CFO Gustavo Arnal, who released ""fraudulent and misleading SEC filings."" Tragically, Arnal died by suicide a few months after the lawsuit was initially filed.

The suit is requesting $1.2 billion in damages for shareholders.

In a rare interview last year, Cohen briefly explained why he sold his Bed Bath &amp; Beyond position: ""In general, it's rare to see a company that goes from aggressively repurchasing shares to losing a lot of money. So when I saw that, and I saw the results, my views of the business changed, and ultimately, I sold.""

Considering this challenging situation, it's likely that the last thing Ryan Cohen wants right now is further involvement with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.

**Moving On and Getting Over It**

There will be something of an afterlife for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Overstock.com (OSTK) has purchased the intellectual property of the home goods retailer and is awaiting the demise of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's stock to take on the BBBY ticker.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

236,stocks,"# INTRODUCTION:

Uniqlo is a clothing retailer which uses a Specialty Store Retailer of Private Label Apparel (SPA) business model meaning they manufacture all their product lines and control the entire production process. Their products are mainly designed to be basic, timeless and able to fit into any outfit. Due to the nature of their products, it fits the taste and preference of Asian countries where consumers prefer products which don’t make them unnecessarily stand out. Uniqlo positions itself away from fast fashion which frees up cash as they do not have to constantly purchase more and more inventory to purchase newer more trendy flavor of the month clothes.  


**INVESTMENT THESIS 1:**  
*COST ADVANTAGE*  
Uniqlo is not in the business of fast fashion unlike their competitors, this means that Uniqlo is able to buy in bulk as they are not worried about their products going out of style with their customers, meaning that clothes stay on the rack for longer periods of time. This affords Uniqlo very large economies of scale as they are able to offer higher quality products at the same or even lower price than their competitors.   
  
**INVESTMENT THESIS 2:**  
*BUSINESS MODEL*  
Uniqlo does not need to spend as much on getting more inventory freeing up more cash for R&amp;D, as evident from their recent innovations like HeatTech and AIRISM. Focusing on not only a basic look but also a clothing line that provides for a lot of utility.  
  
**INVESTMENT THESIS 3:**  
*DIFFERENCE IN AREA OF OPERATIONS*  
Uniqlo operates mainly in Asia, whereas H&amp;M and Zara in Europe and the US. Which may be good because Asia is an upcoming economy where they have a large need for smart casual and as these countries get wealthier, their disposable income increases as well. So the potential addressable market for Asia is very big and Uniqlo is situated perfectly to capitalize on that.  
  
**REVENUE:**  
*UNIQLO*  
When forecasting Number of Stores, I followed this statement made by management   
“We plan to accelerate store openings, targeting 30 new stores annually each in North America and Europe, 100 annual store openings in the Greater China region, and 70-80 annual openings in Southeast Asia &amp; Oceania” - 2022 Earnings Report. AND “In FY2023…We plan to open…40 UNIQLO Japan stores”.   
For Japan, following historic Y/Y growth trend I’ll assume that Uniqlo grows aggressively for the next 3 years as they have been very conservative for the entire covid episode before this growth tapers off.  
For international, as international stores include a large number of countries e.g. China, Europe etc. These are areas where Uniqlo’s management have stated they want to plant the seeds of growth in. Focusing on expanding before fully monetizing the stores. So I’ll assume aggressive growth at more than double of historic amount for 4 years.   
When forecasting Revenue/Store, given that Uniqlo prides itself as being a brand that is “made for all”. And customers have grown to associate Uniqlo as being affordable yet high quality.  
For Japan, I’ll assume that most of the revenue growth per store does not come from prices being elevated but rather premium clothing that can be charged a higher price. I don’t think that much of the growth will be driven by quantity sold as well given that Uniqlo is not a fast fashion clothing store. So, given that R&amp;D is uncertain and takes time I’ll assume that Revenue/store has a meager growth.  
For the entire of my forecasted period having a CAGR of 1% Y/Y  
For International, as Uniqlo enters the market through quick expansion by offering lower prices at the store at the very beginning of the growth period. Past the aggressive growth phase I’ll assume that revenue grows at an elevated pace as Uniqlo begins monetizing the stores.  
*GU*  
When forecasting Number of Stores, the GU brand is a new brand that isn’t as mature as the Uniqlo brand. With very little management guidance other than a 2016 growth strategy slides presentation by management where they want to “open 40\~50 stores annually” ([SOURCE](https://www.fastretailing.com/eng/ir/library/pdf/20161013_GU_en.pdf)). However, in reality this goal was missed by a very large margin in very recent years. So, taking a mix of this optimistic expectation by management and actual historic numbers I came up with a growth forecast for GU. Assuming aggressive expansion for 6 years before it tapers off.  
When forecasting Revenue/Store, GU is positioned as a fast fashion ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-gu-fashion-clothing-brand#:~:text=GU%2C%20a%20sister%20brand%20of,trendy%20pieces%20like%20cargo%20pants)) business so the Revenue/Store of Uniqlo stores is an inaccurate proxy to use for what GU’s revenue/store could look like at a mature state. So, I looked at competitors’ numbers as a proxy instead. Zara had an average Revenue/Store of 860M Yen and H&amp;M had an average Revenue/Store of 600M Yen. So, I assume that in a mature state GU had an average Revenue/Store of 750M Yen.  
*Other Brands*  
When forecasting Number of Stores, as the other brands are not as profitable and in fact as of FY22 have negative operating profits. I’ll assume that the trend of stores closing down continues for the next 2 years before slow and meager organic expansion continues.   
When forecasting Revenue/Store, as the less profitable business with little traction are closed down. Only the profitable ones with higher traction are left around which bumps up our Revenue/Store. In fact, this trend has been true for the past few years. But, as Other Brands slow down the rate of store expansion and focus more on organic growth the Y/Y growth in Revenue/Store will slow down too.   
**COST:**  
*Cost of Sales*  
Cost of Sales I’m assuming it is the cost of producing the shirts, as Uniqlo operates more stores and is required to buy more materials in bulk to stock their stores.  
When forecasting Cost of Sales, I’ll assume that they enjoy some economies of scale and their cost of sales goes down.  
*SG&amp;A*  
When forecasting SG&amp;A, I believe that the human to human interaction in stores will still play a very big part in the next 10 years. SG&amp;A is unlikely to shift drastically, however I believe that AI could be used alongside human workers to lower the necessary labor needed per store, bringing down SG&amp;A.  
*Others*  
When forecasting Others, opting for less granularity I followed historic trends.  
**CHANGE IN NWC:**  
*Receivables*  
When forecasting Receivables, as historically Day Receivables remained more or less constant over time opting for less granularity I followed historic trends.  
*Inventory*  
When forecasting Inventory, given that during Covid-19 Day Inventory was raised due to shipping constraint. In fact, the effects of Covid-19 is still prevalent in Day Inventory as of 2022. I’ll assume that Day Inventory remains elevated for 1 year due to residual Covid-19 effects before tapering down to 2019 levels.  
*Receivables*  
When forecasting Payables, Uniqlo gets a lot of leverage over suppliers given that they are buying in a large bulk. As Uniqlo opens up more stores they are able to buy in even larger quantities allowing them to negotiate for a more favorable term. So Day payable has a meager increase overtime.  
**CapEX and D&amp;A:**  
*D&amp;A*  
Opting for less granularity I followed historic trends.  


*CapEX*  
Management has been getting capital efficient due to Covid-19 for the past few years. And due to the aggressive expansion, I’ll assume management is at an elevated CapEX for 5 years before tapering to being capital efficient.  
**SANITY CHECK:**  
Looking at the ROIC from ([SOURCE](https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry_ManagementEffectiveness.php?ind=1301)) and Historic ROIC, at expansion phase ROIC is in line with these numbers. But at the monetization phase, ROIC is slightly elevated to reflect the growing premium or how much more valuable the Uniqlo brand will become.  
**WACC:**  
Because Japan is a country that experienced a significant stagflationary issue before Covid-19. It’s hard for me to come up with a WACC as it’s hard for me to pinpoint what exactly would be the terminal growth rate for Japan moving out of Covid-19.   
The risk free rate is also another issue. From 2019 onwards, Japan’s 10Y T-Bond actually yielded negative because of how chronic deflation had became in their society.   
So, I’ve decided to take the average WACC for apparel industry from ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/wacc.html)) at 9.15%  


**CONCLUSION:**

Ultimately, I valued Fast Retailing at JPY 38,420 for my base case. I believe that there is still much room for Fast Retailing to grow and the business will only get more profitable from here once they decide either to cut the Other Brands loose or find a way to turn them around. Uniqlo is tackling a growing middle class Asian economy where its offerings addresses the needs of these economies as compared to their rivals. However, the uncertainty revolving Fast Retailing is that one of their largest revenue driver Japan is undergoing stagflation so a significant portion of their business could be affected, explaining the less favorable valuation.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;INTRODUCTION:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniqlo is a clothing retailer which uses a Specialty Store Retailer of Private Label Apparel (SPA) business model meaning they manufacture all their product lines and control the entire production process. Their products are mainly designed to be basic, timeless and able to fit into any outfit. Due to the nature of their products, it fits the taste and preference of Asian countries where consumers prefer products which don’t make them unnecessarily stand out. Uniqlo positions itself away from fast fashion which frees up cash as they do not have to constantly purchase more and more inventory to purchase newer more trendy flavor of the month clothes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INVESTMENT THESIS 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COST ADVANTAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniqlo is not in the business of fast fashion unlike their competitors, this means that Uniqlo is able to buy in bulk as they are not worried about their products going out of style with their customers, meaning that clothes stay on the rack for longer periods of time. This affords Uniqlo very large economies of scale as they are able to offer higher quality products at the same or even lower price than their competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INVESTMENT THESIS 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BUSINESS MODEL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniqlo does not need to spend as much on getting more inventory freeing up more cash for R&amp;amp;D, as evident from their recent innovations like HeatTech and AIRISM. Focusing on not only a basic look but also a clothing line that provides for a lot of utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INVESTMENT THESIS 3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DIFFERENCE IN AREA OF OPERATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniqlo operates mainly in Asia, whereas H&amp;amp;M and Zara in Europe and the US. Which may be good because Asia is an upcoming economy where they have a large need for smart casual and as these countries get wealthier, their disposable income increases as well. So the potential addressable market for Asia is very big and Uniqlo is situated perfectly to capitalize on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REVENUE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

* In a policy statement after its September meeting, the Bank of Japan said it would maintain short-term interest rates at -0.1%.
* The BOJ also capped the 10-year Japanese government bond yield around zero, as widely expected.

Japan’s central bank maintained its ultra-loose policy and left rates unchanged on Friday, mindful of the “extremely high uncertainties” on the growth outlook domestically and globally.

In a policy statement after its September meeting, the Bank of Japan said it would maintain short-term interest rates at -0.1%, and cap the 10-year Japanese government bond yield around zero, as widely expected.

“With extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, the Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing, while nimbly responding to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions,” the Bank of Japan said in its policy statement Friday.

At its previous policy meeting in July, the BOJ loosened its yield curve control to allow longer term rates to move more in tandem with rising inflation in Governor Kazuo Ueda’s first policy change since assuming office in April.

The yield curve control is a policy tool where the central bank targets an interest rate, and then buys and sells bonds as necessary to achieve that target.

The move to broaden the permissible range for 10-year JGB yields of around plus and minus 0.5 percentage points from its 0% target to 1% was seen as the start of a gradual departure from the yield curve control policy enacted by Ueda’s predecessor.

Many economists brought forward their forecasts for a quicker exit from the BOJ’s ultra-loose monetary policy to sometime in the first half of 2024 after Ueda told Yomiuri Shimbun in an interview published Sept. 9 that the BOJ could have sufficient data by the end of this year to determine when it could end negative rates.

**Sustainable inflation**

Despite core inflation exceeding the Bank of Japan’s stated 2% target for 17 consecutive months, BOJ officials have been cautious about exiting the policy, which was put in place to combat decades of deflation in the world’s third-largest economy.

This is due to what the BOJ sees as a lack of sustainable inflation, deriving from meaningful wage growth that it believes would lead to a positive chain effect supporting household consumption and economic growth.

Core inflation — which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices — came in at 3.1% in August, supporting the BOJ’s projection.

Wage growth, output gap — which measures the difference between an economy’s actual and potential output — and price expectations are among factors the Bank of Japan has prioritized as meaningful inflation drivers.

“Japan has the best chance in a generation to move from a deflationary environment to one that is a bit more inflationary and one which has a degree of permanence,” said Oliver Lee, client portfolio manager at Eastspring Investments. 

“The key thing is wages. Japan needs to see meaningful and sustained wage inflation, which can have a psychological impact on consumption,” he said. “Hopefully this could be the start of a virtuous cycle for economic growth, but it’s still too early to say whether that will pan out. We probably need another six to 12 months to see where we are on that front.”

Raising interest rates prematurely may derail growth, while an excessive delay in tightening policy would weigh further on the Japanese yen and raise the risks of financial fragility.

Any delay would also also put more pressure on Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who pledged to help consumers cope with rising living costs at a cabinet reshuffle last week. He also vowed to ensure the world’s third-largest economy will emerge meaningfully out of deflation with wage growth that consistently exceeds the rate of inflation.

Japan’s gross domestic product growth for the April-June quarter was revised down to an annualized 4.8% from the preliminary 6% print due to weak capital spending.

While output gap grew 0.4% in the second quarter to mark the first increase in 15 quarters, uneven domestic economic data and an uncertain global economic outlook have made it more complex for policymakers.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/22/bank-of-japan-september-2023-interest-rates-meeting-monetary-policy.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/22/bank-of-japan-september-2023-interest-rates-meeting-monetary-policy.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Japan has the best chance in a generation to move from a deflationary environment to one that is a bit more inflationary and one which has a degree of permanence,” said Oliver Lee, client portfolio manager at Eastspring Investments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The key thing is wages. Japan needs to see meaningful and sustained wage inflation, which can have a psychological impact on consumption,” he said. “Hopefully this could be the start of a virtuous cycle for economic growth, but it’s still too early to say whether that will pan out. We probably need another six to 12 months to see where we are on that front.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raising interest rates prematurely may derail growth, while an excessive delay in tightening policy would weigh further on the Japanese yen and raise the risks of financial fragility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any delay would also also put more pressure on Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who pledged to help consumers cope with rising living costs at a cabinet reshuffle last week. He also vowed to ensure the world’s third-largest economy will emerge meaningfully out of deflation with wage growth that consistently exceeds the rate of inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s gross domestic product growth for the April-June quarter was revised down to an annualized 4.8% from the preliminary 6% print due to weak capital spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While output gap grew 0.4% in the second quarter to mark the first increase in 15 quarters, uneven domestic economic data and an uncertain global economic outlook have made it more complex for policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

**BLUF**: Amneal Pharmaceuticals (AMRX) is a pharmaceutical company that is poised for a significant upside following a slew of new drugs approved by both the FDA and China. I wanted to share my bullish thesis on why AMRX looks like a strong investment opportunity right now.  
I want to disclose that I remain fully convinced this stock will continue appreciating in value, even after making a significant amount of money form it so far. I purchased 2,500 shares on April 19 at $1.62 per share (166% gain) and 546 contracts (x100) of the Dec 15 '23 $5 calls, which are now worth 0.45 per contracts (128% gain).  
So how did I know Amneal was primed to pop? Huge credit goes to my girlfriend - she's a nurse practitioner and tipped me off in April about a drug that was being discontinued by one of Amneal's competitors (this is all public info if you know where to look). This piqued my interest, so I started analyzing Amneal as the company likely to ramp up production of that drug.  
Right away, I noticed strange after-hours price action - the stock would jump 10% during the day, then shed 8% after hours. Upon closer inspection, it became clear someone was buying up discounted shares after-hours as the price incrementally crept higher.  
**Known Drugs that are popping:**  
Colestipol:  Colestipol is used with diet adjustments to reduce 'bad cholesterol' in people with high cholesterol. It belongs to a group of medications called bile acid sequestrants and works by binding bile acids in the intestines, which are then removed from the body.   
Vyvanse: Some of you are probably aware that  ADHD drugs are in high demand right now and that there’s a shortage, well Amneal received approval for the generic drug.

Now, onto the fundamentals:

**Business Overview:**

* Fully integrated pharma company focused on generics, specialty drugs, and government distribution. 4th largest generics maker in the U.S.
* A diversified portfolio of \~270 complex products like injectables, inhalants, and topicals.
* Growing specialty segment targeting CNS and endocrine disorders.
* AvKARE acquisition expanded presence in government channels.

**Recent Catalysts:**

* Q2 beat on revenue ($599M, +7% YoY) and EPS ($0.19).
* Launched authorized generic of Xyrem - key new complex product.
* Got FDA approval for 5 complex generics, including 3 injectables. On track for 30+ launches in 2023.
* Continued biosimilars momentum with 3rd launch, FYLNETRA.
* Submitted ANDAs for 3 more high-value complex products.
* Raised full-year guidance on revenue, EBITDA, and EPS due to robust performance.

**Growth Drivers:**

* Deep pipeline of pending ANDA approvals for complex generics and biosimilars.
* More authorized generics partnerships like Xyrem.
* Expanding injectables and biosimilars into higher-value products.
* Continued government distribution penetration via AvKARE.
* International expansion is underway in China and Canada.

**Financials**:

* Solid revenue growth - new 2023 guidance of $2.3B-$2.4B (+11% YoY at midpoint).
* Expanding EBITDA margins, with 2023 EBITDA of $525M-$540M (+18% YoY at midpoint).
* EPS growth from operating leverage. 2023 EPS guidance raised to $0.45-$0.55 (+29% YoY at midpoint).
* Strong cash flow to fund growth and potential shareholder returns.

**Valuation**:

* Trades at just 7x 2023 EPS guidance midpoint of $0.50. Very reasonable given expected growth.
* EV/EBITDA of 5.5x on 2023 guidance midpoint of $532.5M is a discount to peers.

Institutional Movements:  
Several institutional investors adjusted their holdings in AMRX during Q1:

* Swiss National Bank increased its shares by 8.6%.
* Bank of New York Mellon Corp increased its stake by 1.1%.
* MetLife Investment Management LLC grew its position by a notable 169.4%.
* Panagora Asset Management Inc. raised its stake by 109.5%.
* BlackRock Inc., a major player, increased its position by 1.3%.
* Collectively, institutional investors and hedge funds own about 31.82% of the company.

**Stock Performance:**

* AMRX's shares started at $4.32 on a recent Wednesday, with a recent trend above their average: 50-day average is $3.75 and 200-day average is $2.68.
* Over the past year, the stock ranged from a low of $1.24 to a high of $4.74.
* The company's market cap stands at $1.32 billion, and its stock metrics include a PE ratio of -216.00 and a beta of 1.31.
* Financial ratios include a debt-to-equity of 17.18 and liquidity ratios of 1.12 (quick) and 1.83 (current).

**Good Vs. Bad:**  
Positive Signs:

* Insider Ownership: A significant portion of the company's stock (26.56%) is owned by company insiders. This is typically viewed as a vote of confidence from those who understand the company best.
* Institutional Interest: Various reputable institutional investors have increased their stake in the company, which could indicate a positive sentiment among major players
* Performance Metrics: The company beat its earnings estimates and posted higher revenues than expected in its recent quarterly earnings, which is a bullish sign.
* Strong Return on Equity: Despite a negative net margin, the company has a robust return on equity of 101.26%.

Concerns:

* High Debt-to-Equity Ratio: A ratio of 17.18 suggests that the company is heavily leveraged and may have significant interest payments.
* Negative PE Ratio: The negative PE ratio indicates the company is not profitable from an earnings perspective, which might be a concern for some investors.
* Stock Volatility: A beta of 1.31 suggests that the stock is more volatile than the market. This might lead to more significant price swings.

**TLDR**: Amneal is an undervalued, high-growth pharma play with multiple near and long-term catalysts, due to it’s fundamentals and new drugs. The disconnect between strong fundamentals and low valuation multiples positions the stock for a breakout.

Engineering teams working on Apple’s modem chip have been slowed by **technical challenges, poor communication and managers split** over the wisdom of trying to design the chips rather than buy them, these people said. Teams were siloed in separate groups across the U.S. and abroad without a global leader. Some managers discouraged the airing of bad news from engineers about **delays or setbacks, leading to unrealistic goals and blown deadlines.**  
“Just because Apple builds the best silicon on the planet, it’s ridiculous to think that they could also build a modem,” said former Apple wireless director Jaydeep Ranade, who left the company in 2018, the year the project began.

248,stocks,"I've done day trading in the past (and I did ok... considering I made more money than I lost), but I kind of lost interest in it.

I want to get back into it, but one of the things that annoyed me with my last run of day trading, was not being able to use a specific strategy, due to technical limitations of my broker.

So here is the question:

Is it possible to do THIS, when setting up a ""OTO"" (One Triggers the Other) Stock Buy / Order:

Place a OTO buy order, which happens if the stock hits a certain price (for example, it drops to $20).

Once OTO buy is ordered (once said stock hits $20), I would want 2 things to happen automatically / immediately: 

\- STOP LOSS Placed (IE: for 2% Below the $100 Buy Price)

\- Trailing Stop Price (For Selling the Stock, if it Reaches a Certain HIGHER Price - IE:  2% ABOVE the $100 Buy Price)

But here is the tricky part:  I wouldn't want the Trailing Stop Price to Happen UNLESS the Stock went up to a certain price  (IE:  $102, which would be about 2% Higher than the buy price of $100)

And then I would have the Trailing Stop Amount Be for like $0.20 or something.

This would be similar to the common technique where you set a OTO with a STOP Loss Price, Paired With a SELL Limit Price, but it would add in the potential for a much higher profit, if the stock price kept rising, and your trailing stop followed it.

The problem is, I don't think it is possible to pull this off using a ""OTO"" order.

Or IS it???

And if not, are there any similar orders that I would do, that would have the same effect????

Otherwise, I am limited to just the OTO with a hard set STOP LOSS and SELL Limit....","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done day trading in the past (and I did ok... considering I made more money than I lost), but I kind of lost interest in it.&lt;/p&gt;

“This IPO is not about raising money for us. It's really about making sure that all employees can have liquidity on stock that they worked very hard for,” Instacart CEO Fidji Simo told CNBC’s Dierdre Bosa on Tuesday. Receiving an equity stake is a major sell to entice top talent to join a startup venture, with the promise that they could one day see a big payout if the company succeeds. Stock offerings are expecially popular in tech compensation, comprising about 86% of a Silicon Valley worker’s net worth, according to Secfi, a company that helps startup employees manage their equity.

Instacart employees certainly stand to benefit. The grocery delivery business opened trading at $42 per share on Tuesday, placing it at a $14 billion valuation, but closed at $33.70 per share the same day. The company included a provision in its S-1 filing where, if the stock trades at more than 120% of its IPO price for five of at least 10 consecutive trading days (one of which must be after Instacart’s quarterly earnings announcement), employees can sell their stock sooner than the 180-day lock-up period most companies opt for.

Instacart’s delicate relationship with its gig workers could also impact its success post-IPO. In its S-1 filing, the company said that failure to attract or retain these workers could hurt its business, as workers may leave the platform for reasons like displeasure with the company’s pay structure, which was recently cut from a minimum base pay of $7 to $4 per order.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/instacart-ceo-says-ipo-employees-122754504.html""&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/instacart-ceo-says-ipo-employees-122754504.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Nike's shares have faced a third consecutive session of decline, bringing its year-to-date losses to over 20%. The downturn makes Nike the second worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for 2023. Several factors contribute to this trend, including broader market volatility, margin pressures, and challenges in the Chinese market, where Nike does about a third of its business.

&lt;p&gt;Nike&amp;#39;s shares have faced a third consecutive session of decline, bringing its year-to-date losses to over 20%. The downturn makes Nike the second worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for 2023. Several factors contribute to this trend, including broader market volatility, margin pressures, and challenges in the Chinese market, where Nike does about a third of its business. Despite the decline, the outlook isn&amp;#39;t entirely grim. &lt;/p&gt;

276,stocks,"Currently TSLA is trading close to $265/share, or about an $880B market cap.

It's a reasonable argument that if an asset can beat the S&amp;P 500 CAGR, then it's a good investment. Given that the S&amp;P typically provides a 5% CAGR, let's see what would be needed for Tesla to achieve a 10% CAGR by, let's say.. end of 2030.

$880B \* 1.10\^7 = $1.71T market cap, or about $512/share

So how does Tesla make it to a $1.7T market cap in 2030? I'm going to assume a 30 P/E, which everyone will bitch and complain about beause they hate Tesla, but I think there's reasonable arguments for and against 30. The ""for"" argument being that I believe they'll still be growing EV sales and energy storage products. If a 30 P/E, then Tesla needs:

$1710B / 30 = $57B in gaap earnings

So how much gaap earnings does Tesla make per EV sold? I'll link to a graph of the ""TTM avg gaap earnings per EV sold"" in the comments

Tesla's current earnings profitability is about $5,600 per EV sold, and it continues to go up over the long term, even if rates have caused a recent drop (earnings per EV maxed out at $10.3k in q1 2022). Let's just assume a long term profitability of $5,700 per EV (super conservative imo). Tesla will need to sell about

$57B earnings / $5,700 earnings per EV = 10M EVs annually

Conclusion: If Tesla sells 10M EVs in 2030, then it is not overvalued today, in fact.. it beats the S&amp;P.

278,stocks,"For long term capital gains, you pay 0% tax rate on the first $44,625 of income from long-term capital gains. In general, should gains in non-retirement taxable accounts be harvested at regular intervals to lock in tax-free income?

In my current case I'm looking at rolling some existing assets from one thing to another so a wash sale wouldn't apply since they're not similar in nature. Also the wash rule only applies to losses, and harvesting losses at 0% tax rate would be counter productive.

I'd be making this move anyway, but my question is that I have the option of unloading the current asset in either long- or short-term holdings, and since I have ordinary income it would seem bad to sell off via LIFO as that would be taxed whereas FIFO would not.

Is there anything I'm overlooking?

Edit:

Yes I am overlooking at least one thing - You don't pay 0% tax on capital gains in a separate bucket from ordinary income. Your total taxable income is considered and investment income stacked on top of that.

So if you're working full time you're probably earning over $44k, therefore any LTCG you realize will pay a 15% LTCG tax rate, or perhaps at 20% if you have a huge taxable income.

So probably not worth doing on a regular basis every year, but perhaps at specific instances where you're selling an asset anyway and can be selective, or a year when your income is really low for some reason.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For long term capital gains, you pay 0% tax rate on the first $44,625 of income from long-term capital gains.

Microsoft is looking to acquire Nintendo “at some point”, and it believes that the Mario maker’s future “exists off of its own hardware”. Through a flurry of leaked documents involved in the court case between the FTC and Microsoft, it has been revealed that the software giant has been looking to acquire Nintendo since the year 2020. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes that the acquisition of Nintendo by Microsoft would be a “career moment” for him, and he believes it would be a good move for both companies.

In his email to Microsoft’s Executive Vice President and Commercial Chief Marketing Officer, Takeshi Numoto, and Chief Marketing Officer, Chris Capossela, Spencer stated that it’s just taking a long time for Nintendo to see that its future “exists off of their own hardware”, but he is firm in his belief that the acquisition will happen “at some point”, and that Nintendo will eventually see things the way Microsoft does. Nintendo has yet to comment on the leaked statement from Phil Spencer.

Addressing Numoto, Spencer stated that he totally agreed that Nintendo is the prime asset for Microsoft in the Gaming business, and that, today, Gaming is the company’s most likely path to consumer relevance. He mentioned that he has had numerous conversations with the LT of Nintendo about tighter collaboration and felt that if any US company would have a chance with Nintendo, Microsoft would probably be in the best position. According to him, the unfortunate (or fortunate for Nintendo) situation is that the Mario maker is “sitting on a big pile of cash”. He said that Nintendo has a Board of Directors (BoD) that, until recently, have not pushed for further increases in market growth or stock appreciation. He clarified that he said “until recently”, as Microsoft’s former BoD member, ValueAct, has been heavily acquiring shares of Nintendo.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://twistedvoxel.com/microsoft-looking-to-acquire-nintendo-future-exists-off-of-its-hw/""&gt;https://twistedvoxel.com/microsoft-looking-to-acquire-nintendo-future-exists-off-of-its-hw/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

[https://i.imgur.com/RKHteqB.png](This is how my portfolio looks like vs sp500 since March 2019)

* 2020: -6%
* 2021: -7.5%
* 2022: -6.2%
* 2023: -15% Ytd (mostly etf, energy and tech) 

I started investing in individual stocks and etfs with the strategy of ""taking profits if it looks too good and selling off if I lose more than 50%""

My major trades:

- sold 50 tsla with 200% in 2020. It looked too good to be true especially when the whole economy was contracting due to covid. Luxury tech cars would be the first to go. If I had waited 2 years it would be +2000%. 
- bought 2x inversed sp500 in January 2020 but forgot that 15% unemployement and all the shops closed is  like nothing for US economy. A milion deaths here and there doesn't change anything. 
- bought 100 GME in 2019 and sold them for a loss just before the short squeeze because the stock has been on a downfall ever since. I hoped for a pivot of the whole strategy of gamestop for more than a year and finally sold not seeing any upward movement. Instead of +3800% got -27%
- BYND -92%. I broke my rule here because I was on holidays when it dropped. 
- Sold CDR before Cyberpunk release and got +120% because I knew it will be reciebed badly by critics but then bought back ""at sale"" shortly after the fall and sold at a loss seeing how it trends down. 
- sold 100 NVDA in 2020 with +60%. Now it would be  +1000%

My overall realized gains is  -$8,000 and ytd is -15%

There is no hope at all for me. I tried to understand the stock market and can't. Since 2020 there is no logic. Penny stocks are doing +1000%, strong companies that have positive cash flows and very low liabilities are just cruising or going down. Bad companies not bringing any profits are exploding because they are being memes.

And I dont know what to do because it looks like the stock market will be flat for the next couple of years and interest rates for real estate are so humongous I don't qualify. I thought the stock market is the way to park money but this + inflation = I'm losing money left and right.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical analysis (TA)&lt;/strong&gt; uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;priced in&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security&amp;#39;s price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.&lt;/p&gt;

287,stocks,"Chevron's earnings have been boosted by soaring energy prices in FY 2022, but as prices consolidate, the company's earnings prospects have deteriorated. CVX is now already deep into an earnings contraction and their Q2'23 free cash flow did not cover shareholder returns. With falling EPS estimates and valuation risks, investors should be cautious.  
Chevron profited in FY 2022 from rising prices for petrol and oil due to favourable market developments. Chevron was able to achieve record profits last year as a result of rising oil prices, but as those prices have begun to stabilise, the energy company's profitability prospects have gotten worse. Given the downward trend in the price of oil and natural gas and the sharp drops in earnings and free cash flow reported by Chevron in Q2'23, I think the company could experience significant losses in a world with lower prices.  
Chevron set forward a bold strategy to increase its free cash flow (estimated 10% FCF growth yearly, Source), but in my opinion, this objective will only be feasible if energy prices continue high. Long-term energy costs have never sustained 10-year highs and have instead consistently stabilised. Because of this, I think investors should prepare for more pressure on Chevron's earnings projections, which have already started to decline significantly. In the past 90 days, analysts have reduced their EPS forecasts for Chevron's fiscal year 2023 twenty times, compared to three upward EPS revisions.  
The largest threat to Chevron is the continuation of the production segment price realisations fall, which had a negative impact on the company's financial results in the second quarter. A severe recession could make this issue worse. Additionally, if Chevron does not comply with Australian unions' pay demands, the company's liquefied natural gas facilities could be shut down, which could put additional pressure on revenues in the near future.  
However, it's possible that a recession won't actually happen, which would be good for Chevron and oil prices. Reuters reports that the likelihood of a recession has just decreased. Energy prices may rise if a recession is avoided, which would reverse Chevron's profitability and free cash flow trend.

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/18/homebuilder-sentiment-goes-negative-for-the-first-time-in-7-months.html

U.S. homebuilders are feeling pessimistic about their business for the first time in seven months, thanks to stubbornly high mortgage rates.

Builder confidence in the single-family housing market fell 5 points in September to 45 on the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index. The decrease follows a 6-point drop in August. Anything below 50 is considered negative.

The index’s three components all declined. Current sales conditions fell 6 points to 51, and sales expectations in the next six months also dropped 6 points to 49. Buyer traffic decreased 5 points to 30.

Builders cite weaker affordability due to higher mortgage rates. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage has been over 7% since June.

As a result, builders are starting to offer more incentives again. In September, 32% of builders said they cut prices, compared with 25% in August. That’s the largest share of builders reducing prices since December 2022, when 35% were doing so.

The average price cut was 6%.

“High mortgage rates are clearly taking a toll on builder confidence and consumer demand, as a growing number of buyers are electing to defer a home purchase until long-term rates move lower,” said Robert Dietz, NAHB’s chief economist, in a release.

A shift is also occurring among those buyers who are still in the market. The NAHB added a new question to this month’s survey and found that 42% of new single-family home buyers year to date were first-time buyers. That is much higher than the historical norm of around 27%.

While builders are still benefiting from the lack of supply on the existing sales market, they are also facing hurdles other than higher interest rates.

“On the supply-side front, builders continue to grapple with shortages of construction workers, buildable lots and distribution transformers, which is further adding to housing affordability woes. Insurance cost and availability is also a growing concern for the housing sector,” said NAHB Chairman Alicia Huey, a homebuilder and developer from Birmingham, Alabama.

Regionally, on a three-month moving average, sentiment in the Northeast fell 2 points to 54. In the Midwest it dropped 3 points to 42.

In the South it declined 4 points to 54, and in the West it decreased 3 points to 47.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

Hello r/stocks

The thesis is simple, Dollar general is not struggling any more or less than others in its industry from shrinkage and inflation.

Yet it’s P/E is 1/3 the industry average even though it outperforms others in the industry that have a 2x or 3x higher PE.

This is a long term investment for about 5-10 years

They have a rapid expansion plan to increase footprint by 50% in 2030 and many cost saving moves in the future. For example self checkout or making their internal trucking service more robust.

Shares of semiconductor firm Arm experienced a whirlwind of market activity recently. The company made an impressive debut on September 14, with its stock surging 25%, taking its valuation to a robust $65 billion. The strong showing provided a much-needed boost to a lackluster IPO market and also encouraged delivery company Instacart to raise its own IPO target price.

Despite Arm's appeal as a significant player in Artificial Intelligence and cloud computing, analysts are cautioning investors to temper their enthusiasm. The company's high valuation has drawn skepticism, given that it represents a significant premium on a price-to-earnings basis compared to other chipmakers.

OXY is my largest holding, with a market cap of  58 Billion, it is massively undervalued. This is my investment thesis and I am interested if anyone else has concluded the same.

What they have:  Using chatgpt, assuming an equal distribution of oil in the Permian Basin, the values of their holdings is over 250 billion dollars. This alone is multiples over the existing market cap, but no where near it’s potential.

What they are building: 

Stay with me….

A few years ago Berkshire Hathaway purchased Pilot Flying J, the largest network of interstate diesel pumps in the US. Bill Gates exited the board of Berkshire. Then over the last 2 years Berkshire has built a 25% position in OXY. 

Early this year Gates himself visited Joe Manchin to lobby (successfully)  for Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Buried in it is a unique 45q direct pay tax credit. Essentially the companies that sequester CO2 will be paid directly from the IRS $180 per ton, for 12 years. After it’s passage, OXY immediately began construction of the worlds largest DAC project. Capable of sequestering one million tons per year. Then the DOE granted a billion dollars in grant funding for carbon capture. OXY received half. They turned around immediately and purchase Gate’s Carbon Engineering. 

But the planned DAC facilities are not for sequestration in the long run.  Rather, and this is my theory, they are using gov funds to subsidize the build out of Global e-fuel production network. This is why Berkshire has taken such large positions in OXY and Pilot. Cars will go electric, truck will stay diesel, but it will be produced from the air, not pulled from the ground. And Occidental Petroleum will dominate selling a “green” drop in solution for truckers worldwide.

312,stocks,"A Chinese persons look into the growing indian market. 

With a booming population and a growing economy, I can't help but believe that India is on the cusp of what china experienced during the 1990s-2010s. Large economic leaps and lifting people out of poverty. 

Here's just the 2 cents of some random guy, but here's just a few factors I think should be considered. 
More and more manufacturing jobs are moving to India (and other SEA countries) and out of china. China is currently experiencing an internal crisis, where the population is getting older, university graduates can't find jobs and a low morale in many young people. An economy in steady decline, collapsing companies and an authoritarian government on the verge of war. 

To me, this seems like a huge niche that needs to be filled in the market. No better candidate than India, a larger and younger population, growing economy and honestly quite an optimistic future. I admit, there are certain things which probably needs to be quickly fixed, such as quality control issues, especially in larger tech giants. 

Indians have also become a force to be reckoned with overseas, over the course of a few short decades, they have quickly become the highest earners in any country they immigrate to. Often receiving the highest levels of education, in the most difficult and sought after degrees in sectors such as stem, technology etc etc. Regardless of that, indians in India, in general are becoming more and more educated with more opportunities to be able to pursue a better life. All this considered, I feel like I am witnessing the sprouting of what could be the next economic superpower. It's only the beginning and it's hard to tell if this is actually gonna happen, but I will personally be closely looking at the indian stock market over the next decade or so. 

All this considered however, this is not gonna be a fast process, its probably gonna take a few decades as we won't ever witness another insane growth of GDP like china did in the early 2000s

Intel Corporation is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Intel is an integrated device manufacturer (IDM). As a result, Intel designs and manufactures its own chips.

In recent years, Intel has struggled with innovation. Competitors such as TSMC, AMD, and Nvidia have chipped away at Intel’s market share. The previous CEO, Bob Swan, failed to foster a culture of innovation vital to operating in the semiconductor industry. After being replaced in 2021, Bob Swan’s successor, Pat Gelsinger, immediately shifted the company’s focus towards IDM 2.0, focusing on technology and manufacturing capacity. This initiative comes at significant capital costs partially offset by Western nations’ subsidies in the aftermath of global COVID-19 supply chain disruptions.

While risks remain within the plan, IDM 2.0 creates a unique value proposition for potential clients. First, Intel’s current node roadmap is technologically superior to its main competitor, TSMC. Furthermore, Intel will have a geographic monopoly on advanced semiconductor nodes. TSMC’s announced expansions in the United States will no longer be generations behind Intel’s at the estimated time of release.

As a result of these factors, Intel trades at a discount to its Intrinsic value. The market and intrinsic value gap exists due to poor short-term business performance and execution risk.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;**I have a position in INTC**&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, two of Silicon Valley’s most high-profile venture firms, are poised to take a massive hit on their last investment in grocery delivery company Instacart, a deal that closed in 2021 as tech stocks were soaring. In its latest IPO prospectus update, filed Friday, Instacart said it plans to sell shares at $28 to $30 apiece, valuing the company at around $10 billion at the top of the range. That’s more than 75% below where Sequoia and Andreessen invested in early 2021. At that time, Instacart sold shares at $125 a piece for a $39 billion valuation. The delivery economy was booming because of Covid shutdowns, and Instacart’s services were seeing record demand.

&gt;“This past year ushered in a new normal, changing the way people shop for groceries and goods,” Instacart finance chief Nick Giovanni said in a press release at the time. In the more than two years since then, Instacart and its investors have learned that growth during that period was anything but normal. Instacart was closing out a quarter in which revenue surged 200%. In the quarter before, sales jumped almost sevenfold. Instacart said it was preparing to increase head count by 50% and bolster investment in advertising.

To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, [making up almost 7% of his portfolio](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc#tabholdings_tab_link). Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead?  
  
Historically, [Pepsi's total return has been higher than Coca Cola's](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). That's been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let's take a look at the latest earnings.

# Latest Earnings 

At the end of July, [Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. Meanwhile, [Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and revenue estimates by 2.7% while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi's stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then. 

# Valuation Metrics

Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. [Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), whereas [Pepsi stands at 24](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke's 9.6. 

# Margins

The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. [Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) than [Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola's margins are more stable than Pepsi's, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that's a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that. 

# Capital Structure

The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of \~$250B and debts of \~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B).   
  
However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke's $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it's nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.

Since that's the case, let's look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. [Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi's outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, [Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi's stock price has been doing better than Coke.

# Dividends 

Coke does have [a better dividend of 3.2%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that's not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don't see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there's just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster.  
  
That's exactly what we see with Pepsi. [Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), that's true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke's at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list. Pepsi's payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don't think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%.   
  
At this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but ***they are almost identical***. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it's raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.

# Technical Analysis

Now, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can't really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi's price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn't closed below it. I think that's a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn't been doing too well. It's down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola's price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we've see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola's price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.

# Price Targets

My personal valuation models put Coca Cola's fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that's somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. The [Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.

On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That's a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi's free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That's why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can't say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. [Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.

# Final Verdict

Now, what's the verdict here? To me, it looks like **the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke**. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. **Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation**. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I'm not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don't have any positions in either of these and I don't think I'll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%. 

That's my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?  
  
**TLDR; Pepsi looks better technically, Coke has a better valuation, but neither are really at a good price point for new entrants.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke or Pepsi? These two companies have dominated the soft drinks industry for over a century. Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. 
A famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that &lt;a href=""https://www.marketingdive.com/news/coke-vs-pepsi-rivalry-brand-marketing-metaverse/621711/""&gt;some argue they have shaped modern marketing&lt;/a&gt;. Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, &lt;a href=""https://awario.com/blog/coke-vs-pepsi-analysis/""&gt;it&amp;#39;s hard to say that today&lt;/a&gt;. Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, which company is the better investment choice?
 We all know that &lt;a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052615/why-did-warren-buffett-invest-heavily-cocacola-ko-late-1980s.asp""&gt;Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties&lt;/a&gt; and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, &lt;a href=""https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc#tabholdings_tab_link""&gt;making up almost 7% of his portfolio&lt;/a&gt;. Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi&amp;#39;s total return has been higher than Coca Cola&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;#39;s been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let&amp;#39;s take a look at the latest earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Latest Earnings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of July, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%&lt;/a&gt;, but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. 
Meanwhile, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6%&lt;/a&gt; and revenue estimates by 2.7% while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi&amp;#39;s stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Valuation Metrics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22&lt;/a&gt;, whereas &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi stands at 24&lt;/a&gt;. However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke&amp;#39;s 9.6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Margins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi&lt;/a&gt; which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola&amp;#39;s margins are more stable than Pepsi&amp;#39;s, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that&amp;#39;s a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Capital Structure&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of ~$250B and debts of ~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke&amp;#39;s $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it&amp;#39;s nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that&amp;#39;s the case, let&amp;#39;s look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases&lt;/a&gt; (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi&amp;#39;s outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares&lt;/a&gt;. Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi&amp;#39;s stock price has been doing better than Coke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dividends&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coke does have &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;a better dividend of 3.2%&lt;/a&gt;. Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that&amp;#39;s not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don&amp;#39;t see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there&amp;#39;s just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s exactly what we see with Pepsi. &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;#39;s true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke&amp;#39;s at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list.
 Pepsi&amp;#39;s payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don&amp;#39;t think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;they are almost identical&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it&amp;#39;s raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Technical Analysis&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can&amp;#39;t really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi&amp;#39;s price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn&amp;#39;t closed below it. I think that&amp;#39;s a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn&amp;#39;t been doing too well. It&amp;#39;s down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola&amp;#39;s price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we&amp;#39;ve see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola&amp;#39;s price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Price Targets&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal valuation models put Coca Cola&amp;#39;s fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that&amp;#39;s somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. 
The &lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars&lt;/a&gt; and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That&amp;#39;s a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi&amp;#39;s free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That&amp;#39;s why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can&amp;#39;t say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. 
&lt;a href=""https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D""&gt;Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi&lt;/a&gt; with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Final Verdict&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what&amp;#39;s the verdict here? To me, it looks like &lt;strong&gt;the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke&lt;/strong&gt;. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. &lt;strong&gt;Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation&lt;/strong&gt;. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I&amp;#39;m not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don&amp;#39;t have any positions in either of these and I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR; Pepsi looks better technically, Coke has a better valuation, but neither are really at a good price point for new entrants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

319,stocks,"PDD engages in accounting fraud and is less profitable than it claims. It's engineered to reward insiders at the expense of the public equity investor.  
  
\#1 - they are generating revenue for items refunded to pad their profitability numbers  
  
Like some other companies (looking at PayPal here), they take a percentage of the sale even if the item is refunded. In the case of PDD, they use this as an opportunity to misrepresent their revenue and earnings in China significantly. They claim to be subsidizing the Chinese consumer in their marketing. They advertise merchandise at impossibly low prices to generate sales, then they refund the customers. All of this shows up as revenue, and each of these refunded orders has a high profit margin to PDD.  
  
Given their use of other entities to misrepresent their financials, and given that no merchant would go into business on the platform just to lose massive amounts of money to PDD by fulfilling none of the orders, this is another case of moving money from the left hand to the right hand to make their financial look more solid than they are.  
  
A buyer in China talked about this, with regard to Apple iPhones: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vxaihh/pinduoduo\_potential\_1billion\_usd\_financial\_fraud/ - ""PDD started its dramatic promotion activities 'Billions Subsidies', which means that PPD promises that they will spend more than a Billion RMB as Subsidies to help lower price of goods sold on their platform as a strategy to attract customer and supplier, in 2019. ... They do not ship the product. I waited for more than a month. They just refuse to ship the product. PDD customer service guy even ask me to apply for refund. I searched on 'Baidu', a popular search engine in China, millions of PDD cases like this happened, most of them are related to 'Billions Subsidies' Activity. They just make 'Fake Sales'. ... Even if the order is canceled, refunded or in other situations, the transaction fee is not refundable to suppliers. This means that PDD can infinitely recogize its transaction revenue as they want, through 'Fake Sales'.""  
  
And a seller in China reported on seeing phantom orders collecting their 0.6% cut for PDD, quoted in the Grizzly report: https://grizzlyreports.com/we-believe-pdd-is-a-dying-fraudulent-company-and-its-shopping-app-temu-is-cleverly-hidden-spyware-that-poses-an-urgent-security-threat-to-u-s-national-interests/ - ""There were also comments on the investment forum that one purported seller on the Pinduoduo platform observed that in the early morning and in the evening, a large number of orders would emerge from the back end of PDD, which would then be canceled. Even though those orders were canceled, Pinduoduo would still collect 0.6% of those payment transactions. It is unclear about the scale of these kinds of activities, but it gives the indication that large and repeating numbers of 'abnormal transactions' are part of the PDD culture.""  
  
\#2 - PDD's main reported revenues come from online marketing services, which is inflated both by insiders and outsiders  
  
Given the way they handle transaction revenue and market non-existent products, PDD is also directly misrepresenting their marketing revenue with ads from their own entities. There is also marketing and transaction volume from fake orders by third parties.  
  
Because PDD is focused on cheap white label mercandise, from many merchants with similar products, sellers seek to generate fake transaction volume, generating fees for PDD, that can help catapult their products to the top of the results: ""Based on our conversation with the order brushing 'expert', when people opened new shops on Pinduoduo’s platform, the owner of the shop could grant access to the order brushing expert. Depending on the terms set between two parties, for example, the new shop owner could ask for how many transactions happened during a certain time period, how many positive reviews that shop would receive, etc. The owner will need to pay fees to the order brushing expert, depending on the terms."" (from the Grizzly report)  
  
As to the economics of how it would make sense to generate all these fake orders, there is evidence of a link between ""brushing"" and money laundering: ""According to the article, two criminals controlled thousands of 'empty package' websites and there were about 600 million of these logistics orders \[for empty package\]. It was later found that these empty packages were actually used as the transaction payments of cross-border gambling. In early June \[2020\], police from Wuxi city arrested 40 people involved in 15 cities. The police from Wuxi compared those empty package order numbers and many of these orders appeared in two cross-border gambling money laundering cases with the total amount of funds of 7 Billion RMB.""  
  
\#3 - they have an undisclosed captive entity (Leqee), established by the founder of PDD, that allows them to underreport headcount, which was more than 4x what they put on financial statements  
  
Blue Orca Capital revealed this a while back: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a81b554be42d6b09e19fc09/t/5bec448e562fa7b00abd26f5/1542210719984/Blue+Orca+Short+Pinduoduo+Inc+%28NASDAQ+PDD%29.pdf  
  
Leqee put out job advertisements on behalf of PDD. Their own website contradicted their filings regarding headcount. Then they edited the website to reduce the number and match their filings.  
  
\#4 - accounting discrepancies overreport revenue and underreport losses significantly  
  
Also in the Blue Orca Capital report. Misrepresentation by 30% to 100% for important figures are estimated. This includes explicit misrepresentation on different financial reports, one from PDD, the two others from entities (VIE) that it controls. The difference is a discrepancy in revenue of 36% between those reports from PDD.  
  
\#5 - their prospectus states that they're counting unsold items as 'merchandise sold'  
  
So they intentionally inflate their figures. There's plenty of orders with unsold items, because anything that doesn't create a team purchase or anything just placed into the equivalent of a shopping cart gets counted as merchandise sold. This is to mislead an unskeptical investor about the volume of business at PDD.  
  
\#6 - they spun off the lucrative payments processing business with ownership by the executives, instead of rewarding the owners of PDD  
  
From the Grizzly report: ""Shanghai Fufeitong was formed to 'supplement' (e.g. 'displace') the payment services that Tencent has been providing to PDD. We believe the eventual goal for PDD is to use Shanghai Fufeitong to control and cash in on as much as possible of the payment transactions that Tencent is currently providing. ... This game of 'hide-the-ball' allows a large amount of the cash flow generated by TEMU to be siphoned off to TEMU executives with little to no oversight or financial accountability. This is a rerun of the AliPay playbook! ... Eventually shareholders found out that Alipay was worth hundreds of billions of USD, but they were not able to enjoy the fruits of that part of business as Alibaba’s shareholders. If you follow investing in Chinese companies, this sounds familiar!""  
  
\#7 - more accounting fraud and misrepresentation of revenue  
  
The Grizzly report also notes that the figures provided regarding payments revenue and transaction services show another likely instance of accounting fraud: ""How can PDD increase its transaction services revenue at a 95% annual rate, yet its transaction processing services received from its two main payment processing companies declined 10.6%? This just doesn’t make sense to us.""  
  
The Blue Orca report shows that PDD claims third party transaction revenue as part of its own revenue figures: ""PDD explicitly tells merchants that it collects no commissions, and that the 0.6% transaction fees are collected on behalf of third -party payment services such as WeChat Pay and Alipay. ... We think in this case that accounting rules clearly prohibit PDD from recognizing transaction fees collected on behalf of third parties on a gross basis. But that, it appears, is exactly what they do. ... This is material because it demonstrates PDD’s aggressive approach to accounting rules. It is also material because firms like PDD trade on a multiple of sales. Even if it is zero margin revenue, PDD can inflate its stock price by recording a higher top line.""  
  
\#8 - shenanigans regarding where billions in stock went  
  
From the same report: ""It was reported (Link) that the main reason for the shareholding decrease was that Chairman Huang donated many shares to different charities. However, the article below was questioning these donations because they were unable to find any information about those charity funds, either in Chinese or in English. ... The takeaway from all these sources is that the correct amount of Chairman Huang’s shareholding in PDD is undisclosed. That holding is worth appx $12 Billion USD in value, at the current price of PDD. Investors don’t know if Mr. Huang really owns those PDD shares, or perhaps he is just a proxy for another party or entity, be that PDD or an undisclosed person or entity. There’s no way to know whether whoever is controlling them is waiting for the right moment to dump these shares on the market.""  
  
\#9 - it's an open secret that nobody outside the company knows the real accounting numbers at PDD  
  
From the Grizzly report: ""Even the usually promotional sell side analysts have pointed out that PDD’s accounting is akin to a 'Black Box' as disclosure becomes ever more opaque. Despite being a company with a market cap of appx $135 billion, PDD has not had a CFO since 2018. The key financial positions are a revolving door. There seems to be no accountability. The local audit partners from Ernst&amp;Young Hua Ming LLP are in our judgment untrustworthy and have audited numerous Chinese companies whose shares have proven next to worthless in the past. ... There have been at least 3 people employed as VP of Finance since 2018, plus the company didn’t even have a VP of Finance (not to mention CFO) for over a year! How can any prudent investor trust the financials of a company which had this lack of financial oversight since the day it went public in 2018? This is governance worthy of a small-cap OTC company.""  
  
The report also notes: ""Ernst &amp; Young Hua Ming LLP has been PDD’s auditor since it went public in 2018. According to PCAOB, E&amp;Y Hua Ming’s Engagement Partner Wei Liu was in charge of PDD’s audit for the fiscal year 2021 and 2022, but before that, another engagement partner Congyue Song was in charge of the audit from 2018 to 2020. Through searching Wei Liu’s audit history, it can be found that Wei Liu only audited another China-based company LightinTheBox (NYSE: LITB) from 2019 and 2020. Congyue Song was in charge of 21Vianet Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: VNET) from 2016 to 2018, Molecular Data Inc. (OTC: MKDTY) from 2018 to 2019, and BEST Inc. (NYSE: BEST) from 2019 to 2022."" All of the companies audited by these firms have lost more than 90% in shareholder value.  
  
\#10 - growth in China has stalled  
  
PDD in China initially gained users from marketing and 'subsidies', which operated at a loss, and from an initial wave of people recruiting peers for deals (also at a loss with promotional freebies). It benefited from the regulatory action against Alibaba, which constrained their marketing spend. PDD is now in a weak position in China, unable to keep operating at a loss and under increased competition from Alibaba and JD. It's now reporting a profit, but it's hiding key numbers on market share and growth.  
  
PDD stopped reporting many different relevant figures during 2021 and 2022: ""GMV, active monthly active users, active buyers in the twelve-month period, annual spending per active buyer in the twelve-month period."" Not reporting the figures is both another indictment of the culture at PDD and of the veracity of their recent growth in China.  
  
The Grizzly report mentions: ""PDD’s quarterly averaged DAU has taken a big drop in Q2 2023. Because in the article, PDD’s estimated DAU in the month of March should be about 354 million (=380m – 26m), but for Q2 2023, the quarterly averaged DAU is only 238 million. There seems to be over 100 million DAU drop from Q1 2023 to Q2 2023. As we just mentioned, different analytic companies might have slightly different numbers when calculating DAU, but we do not believe a difference of over 100 million can be attributed to this. The trend is clear: PDD is sliding while Taobao is gaining ground. ... The decline in PDD's DAU has also been corroborated by some other sources. For example, an account on Snowball (a popular and widely used investor forum) posted a screenshot of a part of Goldman Sachs research report from July 19th 2023, which shows that PDD’s DAU in month of June 2023 'continues to decline at -21% YoY post its app version update'. ... In addition, this article ( Link ) also shows that both Taobao and JD have positive year-over-year growth in their DAUs since February 2023. Yet PDD’s DAU growth rate kept decreasing since February 2023 and its year-over-year growth rate reached over 20% decrease in month of June.""  
  
\#11 - TEMU props up the share price as it sinks the company  
  
Just when it needs to defend its position in China, PDD is operating at an enormous loss to expand internationally. This is costing the company across several fronts: online advertising to acquire users and bring them back to the app, promotional freebies given to users, taking orders at tiny receipt sizes despite all the costs of processing an order, and of course paying for shipping by air. This might even be a decent strategy, in spite of generating massive losses, if it could be turned into a profitable segment of the business.  
  
As reported in this article - https://www.wired.com/story/temu-is-losing-millions-of-dollars-to-send-you-cheap-socks/ - ""In the US, most of Temu’s subsidies come in the form of free international shipping. WIRED looked at multiple analyses of shipping costs, including data from financial research company Haitong International Securities Group, which suggests that the cost of shipping even a small package from Guangzhou, where Temu has its warehouses, to the US is around $14. Haitong’s analysis—confirmed by the Temu insider—shows that J&amp;T Express, the company’s logistics partner, bears some of the costs, but that Temu is on the hook for $9 or $10 per shipment. ... J&amp;T Express is due to go public soon. Analysts say the company has also been subsidizing its own clients to build its market share, but, once public, may need to reduce its incentives to improve its own profitability, with a knock-on impact on Temu’s costs. ... Taking into account other costs beyond shipping—including discounts and cash coupons that Temu gives to customers, and service and administrative costs—the average amount that Temu loses on each order to the US is around $30. These figures were confirmed by the company insider, who, speaking on condition of anonymity, says that the company’s long-term target is for Americans to purchase 30 times per year from Temu, with an average order size of $50, meaning each user spends on average $1,500 a year.""  
  
There's already a company that Americans use to purchase 30+ times a year, one of the world's most valuable brands, with higher quality products, a higher average order size, and exceptional logistics providing extremely fast shipping that is ""free"" -- obviously, that's Amazon.  
  
It's impossible for a company on the other side of the world, without the logistics network, built on the back of freebies and cheap stuff to get there. As soon as the 'subsidies', freebies, and marketing spend punch bowl goes away, the TEMU app becomes less and less relevant to American consumers. If customers in China are fickle about their platform of choice for cheap stuff with goofy marketing, Americans will be even less interested in this second rate company and its third rate products, with a quickness.  
  
\#12 - unsustainable business models, rewarding insiders, and fraudulent accounting are all from the same playbook  
  
The cases of accounting fraud are too many to list them all. Luckin Coffee is a famous one. The goal is to defraud the investor.  
  
The cases of rewarding insiders at the expense of the company are also common. PDD's payment company carve-out is a repeat of AliPay in destroying shareholder value.  
  
The cases of unsustainable business models are found everywhere, but you'd think maybe people would see it when it's ""the same picture."" The TEMU app and wish.com will have the same fate. This has propelled PDD to its highest market cap yet, all on the tale of an e-commerce company with unprecedented growth. Short-term growth that comes by borrowing from tomorrow, impairing whatever long term value could have been built instead.  
  
An evident motive for the management at PDD is to enrich a few at the expense of those investing in the stock. Are you buying it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDD engages in accounting fraud and is less profitable than it claims. It&amp;#39;s engineered to reward insiders at the expense of the public equity investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#1 - they are generating revenue for items refunded to pad their profitability numbers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like some other companies (looking at PayPal here), they take a percentage of the sale even if the item is refunded. In the case of PDD, they use this as an opportunity to misrepresent their revenue and earnings in China significantly. They claim to be subsidizing the Chinese consumer in their marketing. They advertise merchandise at impossibly low prices to generate sales, then they refund the customers. All of this shows up as revenue, and each of these refunded orders has a high profit margin to PDD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given their use of other entities to misrepresent their financials, and given that no merchant would go into business on the platform just to lose massive amounts of money to PDD by fulfilling none of the orders, this is another case of moving money from the left hand to the right hand to make their financial look more solid than they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A buyer in China talked about this, with regard to Apple iPhones: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vxaihh/pinduoduo%5C_potential%5C_1billion%5C_usd%5C_financial%5C_fraud/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vxaihh/pinduoduo\_potential\_1billion\_usd\_financial\_fraud/&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;quot;PDD started its dramatic promotion activities &amp;#39;Billions Subsidies&amp;#39;, which means that PPD promises that they will spend more than a Billion RMB as Subsidies to help lower price of goods sold on their platform as a strategy to attract customer and supplier, in 2019. ... They do not ship the product. I waited for more than a month. They just refuse to ship the product. PDD customer service guy even ask me to apply for refund. I searched on &amp;#39;Baidu&amp;#39;, a popular search engine in China, millions of PDD cases like this happened, most of them are related to &amp;#39;Billions Subsidies&amp;#39; Activity. They just make &amp;#39;Fake Sales&amp;#39;. ... Even if the order is canceled, refunded or in other situations, the transaction fee is not refundable to suppliers. This means that PDD can infinitely recogize its transaction revenue as they want, through &amp;#39;Fake Sales&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a seller in China reported on seeing phantom orders collecting their 0.6% cut for PDD, quoted in the Grizzly report: &lt;a href=""https://grizzlyreports.com/we-believe-pdd-is-a-dying-fraudulent-company-and-its-shopping-app-temu-is-cleverly-hidden-spyware-that-poses-an-urgent-security-threat-to-u-s-national-interests/""&gt;https://grizzlyreports.com/we-believe-pdd-is-a-dying-fraudulent-company-and-its-shopping-app-temu-is-cleverly-hidden-spyware-that-poses-an-urgent-security-threat-to-u-s-national-interests/&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;quot;There were also comments on the investment forum that one purported seller on the Pinduoduo platform observed that in the early morning and in the evening, a large number of orders would emerge from the back end of PDD, which would then be canceled. Even though those orders were canceled, Pinduoduo would still collect 0.6% of those payment transactions. It is unclear about the scale of these kinds of activities, but it gives the indication that large and repeating numbers of &amp;#39;abnormal transactions&amp;#39; are part of the PDD culture.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#2 - PDD&amp;#39;s main reported revenues come from online marketing services, which is inflated both by insiders and outsiders&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the way they handle transaction revenue and market non-existent products, PDD is also directly misrepresenting their marketing revenue with ads from their own entities. There is also marketing and transaction volume from fake orders by third parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because PDD is focused on cheap white label mercandise, from many merchants with similar products, sellers seek to generate fake transaction volume, generating fees for PDD, that can help catapult their products to the top of the results: &amp;quot;Based on our conversation with the order brushing &amp;#39;expert&amp;#39;, when people opened new shops on Pinduoduo’s platform, the owner of the shop could grant access to the order brushing expert. Depending on the terms set between two parties, for example, the new shop owner could ask for how many transactions happened during a certain time period, how many positive reviews that shop would receive, etc. The owner will need to pay fees to the order brushing expert, depending on the terms.&amp;quot; (from the Grizzly report)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the economics of how it would make sense to generate all these fake orders, there is evidence of a link between &amp;quot;brushing&amp;quot; and money laundering: &amp;quot;According to the article, two criminals controlled thousands of &amp;#39;empty package&amp;#39; websites and there were about 600 million of these logistics orders [for empty package]. It was later found that these empty packages were actually used as the transaction payments of cross-border gambling. In early June [2020], police from Wuxi city arrested 40 people involved in 15 cities. The police from Wuxi compared those empty package order numbers and many of these orders appeared in two cross-border gambling money laundering cases with the total amount of funds of 7 Billion RMB.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#3 - they have an undisclosed captive entity (Leqee), established by the founder of PDD, that allows them to underreport headcount, which was more than 4x what they put on financial statements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue Orca Capital revealed this a while back: &lt;a href=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a81b554be42d6b09e19fc09/t/5bec448e562fa7b00abd26f5/1542210719984/Blue+Orca+Short+Pinduoduo+Inc+%28NASDAQ+PDD%29.pdf""&gt;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a81b554be42d6b09e19fc09/t/5bec448e562fa7b00abd26f5/1542210719984/Blue+Orca+Short+Pinduoduo+Inc+%28NASDAQ+PDD%29.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leqee put out job advertisements on behalf of PDD. Their own website contradicted their filings regarding headcount. Then they edited the website to reduce the number and match their filings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#4 - accounting discrepancies overreport revenue and underreport losses significantly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in the Blue Orca Capital report. Misrepresentation by 30% to 100% for important figures are estimated. This includes explicit misrepresentation on different financial reports, one from PDD, the two others from entities (VIE) that it controls. The difference is a discrepancy in revenue of 36% between those reports from PDD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#5 - their prospectus states that they&amp;#39;re counting unsold items as &amp;#39;merchandise sold&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they intentionally inflate their figures. There&amp;#39;s plenty of orders with unsold items, because anything that doesn&amp;#39;t create a team purchase or anything just placed into the equivalent of a shopping cart gets counted as merchandise sold. This is to mislead an unskeptical investor about the volume of business at PDD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#6 - they spun off the lucrative payments processing business with ownership by the executives, instead of rewarding the owners of PDD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Grizzly report: &amp;quot;Shanghai Fufeitong was formed to &amp;#39;supplement&amp;#39; (e.g. &amp;#39;displace&amp;#39;) the payment services that Tencent has been providing to PDD. We believe the eventual goal for PDD is to use Shanghai Fufeitong to control and cash in on as much as possible of the payment transactions that Tencent is currently providing. ... This game of &amp;#39;hide-the-ball&amp;#39; allows a large amount of the cash flow generated by TEMU to be siphoned off to TEMU executives with little to no oversight or financial accountability. This is a rerun of the AliPay playbook! ... Eventually shareholders found out that Alipay was worth hundreds of billions of USD, but they were not able to enjoy the fruits of that part of business as Alibaba’s shareholders. If you follow investing in Chinese companies, this sounds familiar!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#7 - more accounting fraud and misrepresentation of revenue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Grizzly report also notes that the figures provided regarding payments revenue and transaction services show another likely instance of accounting fraud: &amp;quot;How can PDD increase its transaction services revenue at a 95% annual rate, yet its transaction processing services received from its two main payment processing companies declined 10.6%? This just doesn’t make sense to us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blue Orca report shows that PDD claims third party transaction revenue as part of its own revenue figures: &amp;quot;PDD explicitly tells merchants that it collects no commissions, and that the 0.6% transaction fees are collected on behalf of third -party payment services such as WeChat Pay and Alipay. ... We think in this case that accounting rules clearly prohibit PDD from recognizing transaction fees collected on behalf of third parties on a gross basis. But that, it appears, is exactly what they do. ... This is material because it demonstrates PDD’s aggressive approach to accounting rules. It is also material because firms like PDD trade on a multiple of sales. Even if it is zero margin revenue, PDD can inflate its stock price by recording a higher top line.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#8 - shenanigans regarding where billions in stock went&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the same report: &amp;quot;It was reported (Link) that the main reason for the shareholding decrease was that Chairman Huang donated many shares to different charities. However, the article below was questioning these donations because they were unable to find any information about those charity funds, either in Chinese or in English. ... The takeaway from all these sources is that the correct amount of Chairman Huang’s shareholding in PDD is undisclosed. That holding is worth appx $12 Billion USD in value, at the current price of PDD. Investors don’t know if Mr. Huang really owns those PDD shares, or perhaps he is just a proxy for another party or entity, be that PDD or an undisclosed person or entity. There’s no way to know whether whoever is controlling them is waiting for the right moment to dump these shares on the market.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#9 - it&amp;#39;s an open secret that nobody outside the company knows the real accounting numbers at PDD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Grizzly report: &amp;quot;Even the usually promotional sell side analysts have pointed out that PDD’s accounting is akin to a &amp;#39;Black Box&amp;#39; as disclosure becomes ever more opaque. Despite being a company with a market cap of appx $135 billion, PDD has not had a CFO since 2018. The key financial positions are a revolving door. There seems to be no accountability. The local audit partners from Ernst&amp;amp;Young Hua Ming LLP are in our judgment untrustworthy and have audited numerous Chinese companies whose shares have proven next to worthless in the past. ... There have been at least 3 people employed as VP of Finance since 2018, plus the company didn’t even have a VP of Finance (not to mention CFO) for over a year! How can any prudent investor trust the financials of a company which had this lack of financial oversight since the day it went public in 2018? This is governance worthy of a small-cap OTC company.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also notes: &amp;quot;Ernst &amp;amp; Young Hua Ming LLP has been PDD’s auditor since it went public in 2018. According to PCAOB, E&amp;amp;Y Hua Ming’s Engagement Partner Wei Liu was in charge of PDD’s audit for the fiscal year 2021 and 2022, but before that, another engagement partner Congyue Song was in charge of the audit from 2018 to 2020. Through searching Wei Liu’s audit history, it can be found that Wei Liu only audited another China-based company LightinTheBox (NYSE: LITB) from 2019 and 2020. Congyue Song was in charge of 21Vianet Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: VNET) from 2016 to 2018, Molecular Data Inc. (OTC: MKDTY) from 2018 to 2019, and BEST Inc. (NYSE: BEST) from 2019 to 2022.&amp;quot; All of the companies audited by these firms have lost more than 90% in shareholder value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#10 - growth in China has stalled&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PDD in China initially gained users from marketing and &amp;#39;subsidies&amp;#39;, which operated at a loss, and from an initial wave of people recruiting peers for deals (also at a loss with promotional freebies). It benefited from the regulatory action against Alibaba, which constrained their marketing spend. PDD is now in a weak position in China, unable to keep operating at a loss and under increased competition from Alibaba and JD. It&amp;#39;s now reporting a profit, but it&amp;#39;s hiding key numbers on market share and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PDD stopped reporting many different relevant figures during 2021 and 2022: &amp;quot;GMV, active monthly active users, active buyers in the twelve-month period, annual spending per active buyer in the twelve-month period.&amp;quot; Not reporting the figures is both another indictment of the culture at PDD and of the veracity of their recent growth in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Grizzly report mentions: &amp;quot;PDD’s quarterly averaged DAU has taken a big drop in Q2 2023. Because in the article, PDD’s estimated DAU in the month of March should be about 354 million (=380m – 26m), but for Q2 2023, the quarterly averaged DAU is only 238 million. There seems to be over 100 million DAU drop from Q1 2023 to Q2 2023. As we just mentioned, different analytic companies might have slightly different numbers when calculating DAU, but we do not believe a difference of over 100 million can be attributed to this. The trend is clear: PDD is sliding while Taobao is gaining ground. ... The decline in PDD&amp;#39;s DAU has also been corroborated by some other sources. For example, an account on Snowball (a popular and widely used investor forum) posted a screenshot of a part of Goldman Sachs research report from July 19th 2023, which shows that PDD’s DAU in month of June 2023 &amp;#39;continues to decline at -21% YoY post its app version update&amp;#39;. ... In addition, this article ( Link ) also shows that both Taobao and JD have positive year-over-year growth in their DAUs since February 2023. Yet PDD’s DAU growth rate kept decreasing since February 2023 and its year-over-year growth rate reached over 20% decrease in month of June.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#11 - TEMU props up the share price as it sinks the company&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just when it needs to defend its position in China, PDD is operating at an enormous loss to expand internationally. This is costing the company across several fronts: online advertising to acquire users and bring them back to the app, promotional freebies given to users, taking orders at tiny receipt sizes despite all the costs of processing an order, and of course paying for shipping by air. This might even be a decent strategy, in spite of generating massive losses, if it could be turned into a profitable segment of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported in this article - &lt;a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/temu-is-losing-millions-of-dollars-to-send-you-cheap-socks/""&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/temu-is-losing-millions-of-dollars-to-send-you-cheap-socks/&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;quot;In the US, most of Temu’s subsidies come in the form of free international shipping. WIRED looked at multiple analyses of shipping costs, including data from financial research company Haitong International Securities Group, which suggests that the cost of shipping even a small package from Guangzhou, where Temu has its warehouses, to the US is around $14. Haitong’s analysis—confirmed by the Temu insider—shows that J&amp;amp;T Express, the company’s logistics partner, bears some of the costs, but that Temu is on the hook for $9 or $10 per shipment. ... J&amp;amp;T Express is due to go public soon. Analysts say the company has also been subsidizing its own clients to build its market share, but, once public, may need to reduce its incentives to improve its own profitability, with a knock-on impact on Temu’s costs. ... Taking into account other costs beyond shipping—including discounts and cash coupons that Temu gives to customers, and service and administrative costs—the average amount that Temu loses on each order to the US is around $30. These figures were confirmed by the company insider, who, speaking on condition of anonymity, says that the company’s long-term target is for Americans to purchase 30 times per year from Temu, with an average order size of $50, meaning each user spends on average $1,500 a year.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s already a company that Americans use to purchase 30+ times a year, one of the world&amp;#39;s most valuable brands, with higher quality products, a higher average order size, and exceptional logistics providing extremely fast shipping that is &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; -- obviously, that&amp;#39;s Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s impossible for a company on the other side of the world, without the logistics network, built on the back of freebies and cheap stuff to get there. As soon as the &amp;#39;subsidies&amp;#39;, freebies, and marketing spend punch bowl goes away, the TEMU app becomes less and less relevant to American consumers. If customers in China are fickle about their platform of choice for cheap stuff with goofy marketing, Americans will be even less interested in this second rate company and its third rate products, with a quickness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#12 - unsustainable business models, rewarding insiders, and fraudulent accounting are all from the same playbook&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases of accounting fraud are too many to list them all. Luckin Coffee is a famous one. The goal is to defraud the investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases of rewarding insiders at the expense of the company are also common. PDD&amp;#39;s payment company carve-out is a repeat of AliPay in destroying shareholder value.&lt;/p&gt;

I know plenty of white hat hackers (those are the good people - black hats are the bad ones). My friends who are white hat hackers say it is unreal how easy things can be breached. The only solution in their eyes is better cybersecurity. I am not sure why so many cybersecurity stocks (i.e. Cloudflare \[NET\], Crowdstrike \[CRWD\], etc) did not continue to run from their highs over the past 24 months. Maybe someone on here would know why that is? 

I see the following stocks having a good run over the next 24 months: 

1) Endava plc \[DAVA\]: Earnings very soon, rated a ""buy"" from sources ([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAVA&amp;ty=c&amp;p=d&amp;b=1](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAVA&amp;ty=c&amp;p=d&amp;b=1)) and is well below its ATH. This company is out of the UK so for those who only want USA stocks be aware. 

2) Cloudflare: This stock along with Palo Alto are good long term holds, well past 24 months. 

The only thing that could hurt these stocks, since AI is booming and with more AI comes more hacking would be if companies like Salesforce, Microsoft, etc completely form a better cybersecurity set of products than the big name cybersecurity companies do. The one stock I like to swing trade in the cybersecurity field is OKTA, have used it to swing trade recently for an 11% gain and did so back in 2021. Feel like there is plenty of money to be made in cybersecurity stocks. 

My current holdings: 31 shares of Cloudflare, 12 shares of Palo Alto, 128 shares of DAVA (swing trade - probably will perform well in upcoming earnings), and exited my position (11) shares of OKTA recently after my gain.

&lt;p&gt;I know plenty of white hat hackers (those are the good people - black hats are the bad ones). My friends who are white hat hackers say it is unreal how easy things can be breached. The only solution in their eyes is better cybersecurity. I am not sure why so many cybersecurity stocks (i.e. Cloudflare [NET], Crowdstrike [CRWD], etc) did not continue to run from their highs over the past 24 months. Maybe someone on here would know why that is? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see the following stocks having a good run over the next 24 months: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Endava plc [DAVA]: Earnings very soon, rated a &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; from sources (&lt;a href=""https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAVA&amp;amp;ty=c&amp;amp;p=d&amp;amp;b=1""&gt;https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAVA&amp;amp;ty=c&amp;amp;p=d&amp;amp;b=1&lt;/a&gt;) and is well below its ATH. This company is out of the UK so for those who only want USA stocks be aware. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Cloudflare: This stock along with Palo Alto are good long term holds, well past 24 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that could hurt these stocks, since AI is booming and with more AI comes more hacking would be if companies like Salesforce, Microsoft, etc completely form a better cybersecurity set of products than the big name cybersecurity companies do. The one stock I like to swing trade in the cybersecurity field is OKTA, have used it to swing trade recently for an 11% gain and did so back in 2021. Feel like there is plenty of money to be made in cybersecurity stocks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current holdings: 31 shares of Cloudflare, 12 shares of Palo Alto, 128 shares of DAVA (swing trade - probably will perform well in upcoming earnings), and exited my position (11) shares of OKTA recently after my gain. &lt;/p&gt;

https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/uaw-strike-tesla-labor-costs-baf8b897

More than a day into the United Auto Workers strike against the Detroit automakers and one thing is clear: Elon Musk has already won.

And the billionaire tycoon isn’t even involved. 

Musk won before the strike began early Friday. He won before negotiations started two months ago. From the get-go, General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis were expected to spend more on wages because of the union’s pressure. The question is just how much of an increase, and so far their offers haven’t pleased the union, igniting this past week’s work stoppage.

**Whatever happens, more money surely will be spent. Any wage increase further advances Tesla’s already tremendous cost advantage in EVs over its older U.S. peers, which are contending with generations of legacy expenses while trying to steer a costly transition to electric from gas-powered vehicles.**

In March, Musk revealed plans to build on his advantage by setting a goal of slashing manufacturing costs for the automaker’s next-generation vehicles by 50%, an ambitious agenda that will depend upon advanced automation, savvy engineering and other changes. 

The Tesla chief executive’s actions this year have shown how Tesla can take advantage of a lower cost structure to engage in price wars with rivals around the world to juice sales.

In July, Tesla reported second-quarter profit that rose 20% even after reducing prices. Around the same time, in the midst of steep losses from its electric vehicles, Ford said it would slow its EV production growth. 

All of this is playing out as the UAW seeks more than what the Detroit automakers say they can afford and remain competitive. The companies have offered wage increases of varying sizes reaching as high as 20% over four years, while UAW President Shawn Fain countered with a mid-30% increase, down from a previous ask of at least 40%. 

**The Detroit companies’ labor costs, including wages and benefits, are estimated at an average of $66 an hour, according to industry data. That compares with $45 at Tesla, which isn’t unionized and was founded 20 years ago. Meeting all of Fain’s initial demands would boost average hourly labor costs to $136 for the Detroit companies, Wells Fargo estimated.**

A key difference between Tesla’s compensation plan and that of the UAW workers revolves around company upside. UAW workers have been getting profit-sharing bonuses while Tesla workers receive stock options, which don’t have a direct cash cost to the company. Over the years, Tesla shares have risen like a rocket, though there have been periods of turbulence. Shares this year have more than doubled.

Fain argues that past contracts haven’t kept up with inflation, hurting the union’s roughly 146,000 auto workers’ spending power, and that members’ sacrifices have helped make the companies profitable in recent years. 

**“This is our generation’s defining moment,” Fain said late Thursday before the walkout. “The money is there. The cause is righteous.”**

Shortly afterward, Ford responded, saying the union’s demands would “more than double Ford’s current UAW-related labor costs, which are already significantly higher than the labor costs of Tesla, Toyota and other foreign-owned automakers in the United States that utilize non-union-represented labor.”

Many analysts, so far, are expecting that the Detroit companies will ultimately absorb the added costs. “The much larger issue is that it adds incremental pressure to their already challenged transition to an EV world,” Dan Levy, an analyst for Barclays, cautioned investors in a recent note 

Fain this past week sounded annoyed when asked about Tesla’s cost advantage. 

“Competition is code word for race to the bottom, and I’m not concerned about Elon Musk building more rocket ships so he can fly in outer space and stuff,” Fain told CNBC on-air Wednesday. “Our concern is working-class people need their share of economic justice in this world.”

Focus on the labor-cost gap is a classic part of Detroit negotiations—raised by executives, investors and analysts every cycle. Before Tesla, there was Toyota Motor and its nonunion pay rates. 

U.S. automakers spent years arguing that Asian rivals, without UAW contracts, benefited from cheaper labor costs that allowed them to plow savings into cars that appealed to consumers. 

Narrowing the labor-cost gap was a key part of the painful restructuring of the auto industry around 15 years ago, when union members made unprecedented concessions to help save their employers and their jobs. 

Art Wheaton, a labor expert at Cornell University, suggests that the UAW’s ability to get higher wages could help put heat on Tesla during any renewed effort to organize there.

“I don’t think Elon Musk has all of that superwonderful, high-polished glow anymore,” he said, noting the controversies the billionaire has had regarding his recent ownership of Twitter-turned-X. “Some of that patina has been wiped clean.”

The UAW had its best shot in years to organize Tesla during labor strife in 2017 and 2018, when workers were feeling the burn of “production hell” at what was then the automaker’s lone assembly plant outside San Francisco as it struggled with the Model 3 sedan.

But the organizing effort failed.

The National Labor Relations Board has ruled that Tesla violated U.S. labor law in its handling of the matter, including statements by Musk that were considered threatening when he tweeted that hourly workers would lose stock options if they joined the UAW. An appeal by the company, which has denied wrongdoing, is pending. 

Musk has suggested that employee stock options make his factory workers the highest compensated in the industry, saying “quite a few” line workers have become “millionaires over the years from company stock grants.” Options allow workers to buy stock at a certain price after working at the company for a set amount of time. 

At Tesla, the average pay for a manufacturing technician can range from $23 to $32 an hour, according to estimates by Glassdoor. Tesla advertises factory jobs in California with expected pay ranging from $24 to $67 an hour plus cash and stock awards and other benefits. 

On Thursday, Musk took another jab at the UAW, after essentially daring the union last year to try again to organize his workers, boasting that his factories “have a great vibe.”

“We encourage playing music and having some fun. Very important for people to look forward to coming to work!” he tweeted recently. “We pay more than the UAW btw, but performance expectations are also higher.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tickers mentioned: GM, F, STLA, TSLA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meeting UAW&amp;#39;s initial demand would increase total average hourly compensation from $66 to $136 an hour vs. $45 at Tesla, according to Wells Fargo.  They are asking for a 32-hour work week but annualized on a 40-hour week that would be approximately $283,000 in total compensation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would further widen Tesla&amp;#39;s tremendous advantage in efficiency as legacy automakers try to steer a costly transition to a future away from carbon emitting gas vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A key difference in compensation is TSLA employees tend to get cheap options that can increase a lot in value if the stock moves up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“This is our generation’s defining moment,” Fain said late Thursday before the walkout. “The money is there. The cause is righteous.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Competition is code word for race to the bottom, and I’m not concerned about Elon Musk building more rocket ships so he can fly in outer space and stuff,” Fain told CNBC on-air Wednesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/uaw-strike-tesla-labor-costs-baf8b897""&gt;https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/uaw-strike-tesla-labor-costs-baf8b897&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a day into the United Auto Workers strike against the Detroit automakers and one thing is clear: Elon Musk has already won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the billionaire tycoon isn’t even involved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk won before the strike began early Friday. He won before negotiations started two months ago. From the get-go, General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis were expected to spend more on wages because of the union’s pressure. The question is just how much of an increase, and so far their offers haven’t pleased the union, igniting this past week’s work stoppage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever happens, more money surely will be spent. Any wage increase further advances Tesla’s already tremendous cost advantage in EVs over its older U.S. peers, which are contending with generations of legacy expenses while trying to steer a costly transition to electric from gas-powered vehicles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, Musk revealed plans to build on his advantage by setting a goal of slashing manufacturing costs for the automaker’s next-generation vehicles by 50%, an ambitious agenda that will depend upon advanced automation, savvy engineering and other changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tesla chief executive’s actions this year have shown how Tesla can take advantage of a lower cost structure to engage in price wars with rivals around the world to juice sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July, Tesla reported second-quarter profit that rose 20% even after reducing prices. Around the same time, in the midst of steep losses from its electric vehicles, Ford said it would slow its EV production growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is playing out as the UAW seeks more than what the Detroit automakers say they can afford and remain competitive. The companies have offered wage increases of varying sizes reaching as high as 20% over four years, while UAW President Shawn Fain countered with a mid-30% increase, down from a previous ask of at least 40%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Detroit companies’ labor costs, including wages and benefits, are estimated at an average of $66 an hour, according to industry data. That compares with $45 at Tesla, which isn’t unionized and was founded 20 years ago. Meeting all of Fain’s initial demands would boost average hourly labor costs to $136 for the Detroit companies, Wells Fargo estimated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key difference between Tesla’s compensation plan and that of the UAW workers revolves around company upside. UAW workers have been getting profit-sharing bonuses while Tesla workers receive stock options, which don’t have a direct cash cost to the company. Over the years, Tesla shares have risen like a rocket, though there have been periods of turbulence. Shares this year have more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fain argues that past contracts haven’t kept up with inflation, hurting the union’s roughly 146,000 auto workers’ spending power, and that members’ sacrifices have helped make the companies profitable in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This is our generation’s defining moment,” Fain said late Thursday before the walkout. “The money is there. The cause is righteous.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly afterward, Ford responded, saying the union’s demands would “more than double Ford’s current UAW-related labor costs, which are already significantly higher than the labor costs of Tesla, Toyota and other foreign-owned automakers in the United States that utilize non-union-represented labor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many analysts, so far, are expecting that the Detroit companies will ultimately absorb the added costs. “The much larger issue is that it adds incremental pressure to their already challenged transition to an EV world,” Dan Levy, an analyst for Barclays, cautioned investors in a recent note &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fain this past week sounded annoyed when asked about Tesla’s cost advantage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Competition is code word for race to the bottom, and I’m not concerned about Elon Musk building more rocket ships so he can fly in outer space and stuff,” Fain told CNBC on-air Wednesday. “Our concern is working-class people need their share of economic justice in this world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on the labor-cost gap is a classic part of Detroit negotiations—raised by executives, investors and analysts every cycle. Before Tesla, there was Toyota Motor and its nonunion pay rates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. automakers spent years arguing that Asian rivals, without UAW contracts, benefited from cheaper labor costs that allowed them to plow savings into cars that appealed to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narrowing the labor-cost gap was a key part of the painful restructuring of the auto industry around 15 years ago, when union members made unprecedented concessions to help save their employers and their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Art Wheaton, a labor expert at Cornell University, suggests that the UAW’s ability to get higher wages could help put heat on Tesla during any renewed effort to organize there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think Elon Musk has all of that superwonderful, high-polished glow anymore,” he said, noting the controversies the billionaire has had regarding his recent ownership of Twitter-turned-X. “Some of that patina has been wiped clean.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAW had its best shot in years to organize Tesla during labor strife in 2017 and 2018, when workers were feeling the burn of “production hell” at what was then the automaker’s lone assembly plant outside San Francisco as it struggled with the Model 3 sedan.&lt;/p&gt;

Am I paying that tax to the US because it’s an ADR ? And if so, shouldn’t I just switch to the non ADR one?

-----------------

Fast-food workers in California are set to receive pay hikes next year after the restaurant industry and unions reached a compromise over a controversial bill.

The deal, brokered with the help of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office, also creates a nine-person council that will decide on future wage hikes for the fast-food industry in California through 2029. The agreement ends a fight between the two sides that threatened to stretch out for years. The restaurant industry was gearing up to spend more than $100 million on the battle.

The deal will mean a wage floor of $20 for California workers at fast-food chains with at least 60 locations nationwide, starting April 1. And from 2025 through 2029, the appointed council will have the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually by whichever is lower: 3.5% or the annual change in the consumer price index.

The council will include four representatives from the fast-food industry, four from the workers’ side and one neutral party who will serve as chair.

While fast-food operators will have to cope with paying higher wages, the agreement thwarts more dire consequences, according to industry analysts.

“I certainly wouldn’t say it’s catastrophic, and certainly not as bad as it could have played out over the next year or two,” said Mark Kalinowski, CEO of Kalinowski Equity Research.

California lawmakers rushed to conclude the matter before the legislative session ends midnight Friday. The state senate passed the bill Thursday, and the state assembly has concurred with the upper house’s amendments. Newsom, a Democrat, has already pledged to sign the bill into law.

**California’s fast-food fight**

Newsom signed AB 257, also known as the FAST Act, into law in January. The legislation would have created a 10-person council that would govern fast-food chains with more than 60 locations, including setting guidelines for working conditions and wages. The initial wage hike could have been as high as $22 an hour.

But the fast-food industry was attacking the bill before it even made its way to Newsom’s desk. State records show that Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chick-fil-A, Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International were among the chains that spent money to lobby California lawmakers to oppose the legislation.

McDonald’s U.S. President Joe Erlinger wrote a letter posted on the company’s website, making a rare public statement on a political issue. Erlinger called the bill “lopsided” and “ill-considered,” attacking lawmakers for not targeting all restaurants. As of 2022, just under 10% of McDonald’s U.S. restaurants were located in California, according to Citi Research. Most are run by franchisees.

The restaurant industry retaliated, gathering enough signatures to create a referendum that would make California’s voters decide on the matter. The Service Employees International Union, which backed the FAST Act, alleged in a lawsuit that the industry misled signatories, but a judge ruled against the union. The referendum was supposed to be on November 2024 ballots.

In response to the referendum, the SEIU backed another bill, AB 1228. The bill would impose joint-employer liability on franchised businesses — including the very restaurant chains that loudly decried AB 257.

Under the bill, franchisors like McDonald’s would be held liable for infractions committed by their franchisees. Opponents said that the bill attacked the very nature of the franchising model. AB 1228′s provisions were originally included in AB 257 but removed before Newsom signed it into law.

The California State Assembly passed AB 1228 in early June. But the state’s Senate never had the chance to vote on that version.

Instead, the restaurant industry and the unions struck a deal, replacing the joint-employer provisions with the terms of their agreement, which also includes repealing the FAST Act and withdrawing the referendum by Jan. 1.

**What’s next for workers?**

Fast-food workers employed by affected restaurants will see pay increases of as much as 25% hit their paychecks starting in April. The current California minimum wage is $15.50 an hour, with a bump to $16 set for January.

Employees of smaller fast-food joints and other restaurants could also reap some benefits from the legislation.

“When you look at the $20 minimum wage, that’s a bar that’s being set,” Joe Pawlak, managing principal of restaurant consulting firm Technomic, told CNBC. “That’s going to make the restaurant industry a lot more competitive for employees, so other industries are going to have to also step up.”

In recent years, Amazon warehouses and retailers like Walmart and Target have lured workers away with higher hourly pay. Now they’ll be forced to compete with fast-food chains, which have traditionally been slower to raise wages due to operators’ razor-thin margins.

Other states, like Minnesota or New York, could also follow California’s lead and craft similar councils to govern restaurants or other industries, Pawlak said.

″[The deal] puts a model in place with a structure that everybody is able to digest,” he said.

Still, labor’s side had to make some trade-offs to get the deal in California. One key concession is that the council won’t have the power to set working conditions. Instead, the Fast Food Council will only be able to recommend proposed standards to state agencies.

But that doesn’t mean that unions won’t keep trying to push for better conditions.

“Fast-food workers’ fight in California isn’t close to over — it has only just begun as they prepare to take their seat at the table and help transform their industry for the better,” SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said in a statement to CNBC.

**What does it mean for restaurants?**

Faced with a mandate to pay higher wages, fast-food operators will have to decide how they plan to deal with elevated labor costs. Some may raise menu prices, although customers may balk at having to foot the bill. Others may try to make do with fewer workers on hand or to invest in automation to handle more tasks.

But it’s not all gloomy for restaurants.

“This agreement protects local restaurant owners from significant threats that would have made it difficult to continue to operate in California. It provides a more predictable and stable future for restaurants, workers, and consumers,” Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs at the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement.

The chief uncertainty resolved by the deal is the referendum slated for November 2024 ballots. The industry had already spent more than $64 million on the referendum, according to California records, and was preparing to spend much more. But it would be difficult to predict which side voters would take.

″[The agreement] shows just how concerned the industry was,” Kalinowski said. “The referendum would have been very challenging, to have it come out their way.”

On top of that, restaurant chains like In-N-Out now save some cash that otherwise would have gone toward the industry’s war chest.

The deal also avoids the change to joint-employer liability that was feared by the broader franchising industry.

“This allows the franchise model to exist,” said Dana Kravetz, a Los Angeles-based labor attorney at Michelman &amp; Robinson.

Fast-food companies with heavily franchised footprints, like McDonald’s, KFC, Taco Bell and Domino’s Pizza, will largely escape the effects of the bill, unless they have company-owned locations in California.

Instead, their franchisees will have to grapple with how to pay higher wages. The National Owners Association, an independent advocacy group of McDonald’s franchisees, plans to push back. In a memo viewed by CNBC, the NOA projects the bill will cost each restaurant in the state $250,000 annually.

Restaurant companies that don’t franchise will have to foot the bill for increased labor costs themselves. That includes Chipotle Mexican Grill, which has 457 locations — or 14% of its total footprint — in its home state of California.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/15/california-fast-food-minimum-wage-deal-what-to-know.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/15/california-fast-food-minimum-wage-deal-what-to-know.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

351,stocks,"Thousands of members of the United Auto Workers went on strike at three U.S. assembly plants of General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis after the union and the automakers failed to reach a deal on a new labor contract Thursday night.

“The UAW Stand Up Strike begins at all three of the Big Three,” the union said in a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, just after midnight Friday.

The facilities are GM’s midsize truck and full-size van plant in Wentzville, Missouri; Ford’s Ranger midsize pickup and Bronco SUV plant in Wayne, Michigan; and Stellantis’ Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator plant in Toledo, Ohio. For Ford, UAW President Shawn Fain said only workers in paint and final assembly will be on strike.

“We got to do what we got to do to get our share of economic and social justice in this strike,” Fain said outside the Ford facility in Wayne. “We’re going to be out here until we get our share of economic justice. And it doesn’t matter how long it takes.”

The selected plants produce highly profitable vehicles for the automakers that largely continue to be in high demand. About 12,700 workers – 5,800 at Stellantis, 3,600 at GM and 3,300 at Ford – will be on strike at the plants in total, the union said. The UAW represents about 146,000 workers across Ford, GM and Stellantis.

# INTRODUCTION:

SPOT has become the largest music streaming platform in the market even outperforming platforms backed by giants such as Apple or Amazon. SPOT users swear by the personalized selection given by SPOT and how seamless their music listening experience is with spotify connect. But, the path to capitalizing on all this for SPOT is a murky one which I’m skeptical SPOT is capable of reaching.   
  
As a general guideline for my forecast, I followed what management laid out in the 2022 investor day where SPOT expects to continue investing in podcasting and audio books, in the short run focus on improving Monthly Active Users(MAUs) rather than Average Revenue Per User(ARPU). The end goal by 2030 should be 1 Billion MAUs and $100 ARPU.   


# REVENUE:

  
The main concern I have with SPOT is their piracy issue. Piracy is still very easily conducted, it could be as simple as turning on an ad blocker or installing the “Cracked” version of SPOT on Android ([SOURCE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/x8ri64/the_ultimate_spotify_ad_blocking_guide_windows/))  
  
Piracy is an ailment of every service, it cannot be eradicated completely. For SPOT to put a meaningful end to Piracy the benefit (Convenience) and cost of SPOT (Legality, Financially and Restrictions) has to far outweigh the cost of Piracy (Risk, Time and Effort).   
  
To quote Gabe Newell the founder of Steam, a platform that distributes video games.   
“Piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem. If a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24 x 7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says the product is region-locked, will come to your country 3 months after the US release, and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store, then the pirate's service is more valuable.""  
  
I believe that SPOT is cheap enough for a monthly subscription and the value of the service far outweighs the cost of piracy. So, when forecasting revenue I’ll assume that Piracy is not a significant factor/consideration that will affect MAU and in turn affect revenue.  
  
When forecasting MAU, I’ll assume churn is not a significant factor based on management's statement, “Year-over-year churn, though, was pretty consistent with where it was at this point last year. So even with the strong growth, we're not seeing any uptick in churn at all.” - Q4 2022 Earnings conference. As SPOT is in the process of rolling out and expanding on their new offerings like Audiobook and Podcast, I’ll assume MAU grows at historic rates as there are a lot of low hanging fruits to pick off at the start of the implementation. Based on 2022 Investor Day, SPOT is expecting a CAGR of 9.4% for the next 7 years.   
  
When forecasting MAU conversion rate, I’ll assume that users have to try the service for a bit before deciding whether to take up SPOT’s services or not. So the conversion rate climbs steadily before holding constant at perpetuity, as there is always a group of consumers whose needs/situation makes subscribing to SPOT not attractive enough.  
  
  
  
When forecasting ARPU, the rationale for the first few years of forecast is slow and meager Y/Y growth based on management’s statement, “we're mostly focused on growth. So that's our general approach.” - Q4 2022 Earnings Conference. During the high growth period, as SPOT is more focused on gaining new MAU they will raise prices at very meager rates before switching to monetizing mode when new features are fully established. But because SPOT is very careful about raising prices too much as they are worried that will drive MAU towards rival products, the overall CAGR is held at about 2% for my entire forecast period.  
  
When forecasting Advertising revenue, SPOT plans on using Audiobooks, Podcast to increase advertising spend to improve advertising revenue. Rationale for this is that by giving larger audio offerings means MAU spends longer on the platform allowing for SPOT to earn more advertising revenue. But, as these offerings are quite new there isn’t much reliable historic data to base the Y/Y growth rate off. So, opting for less granularity. The growth rate of advertising revenue is pegged to growth rate of ad-supported MAU as management showed in 2022 investor presentation that Ad-supported MAU had a direct correlation with Ad revenue. Overall, it had a CAGR of about 6%.  


# COST:

Cost of revenue is mainly consisting of Royalty and Distribution cost. I doubt that SPOT has much room to reduce Royalty as the terms set up by record labels against SPOT are predatory in nature. With monthly payment of royalty from SPOT, certain of these royalty payments are required to be paid upfront in advance or SPOT has to give them a guaranteed minimum royalty. On top of that, certain licensors have a “Most Favored Nation” Clause which is a clause stating that if other licensors perform better than the licensor with the clause, SPOT has to make up the difference. All these Predatory terms ensure that SPOT will always have to burn a hole in its pocket first before it can even start paying downwards to other aspects of the business e.g. R&amp;D. SPOT can’t do anything about it as the big 3 music licensing can just refuse to license their music to SPOT.   
“increase in Premium cost of revenue was driven primarily by increases in new Premium Subscribers, publishing licensing rates”.   
  
When forecasting cost of revenue, some drag on gross margin is experienced as SPOT recently started investing in podcasts which they expect drag to be lifted by 2023 as per 2022 Q4 Earnings Conference. However, as licensing agencies have SPOT at a chokehold, I’ll assume that the needle doesn't shift very much. Cost of revenue holds at historical rates.  
  
  
When forecasting Marketing and R&amp;D, as it’s unpredictable how management will make operating decisions and what to invest in moving forward. I’ll use historic to avoid being overly granular.  
  
When forecasting G&amp;A, as management recently had a layoff I’ll assume that G&amp;A spend remains at historic levels before tapering downwards.  


# CHANGE IN NWC:

When forecasting change in NWC, I made sure to take the historic of the past 4 years. Only the past 4 years was used as SPOT intrinsically changed since 2018, moving past just being a music only business into Audiobooks and Podcasts which may affect Day Receivables and Payables.

# CAPEX &amp; D&amp;A:

CapEX only took into account purchase of physical buildings which I thought was not meaningful in helping to expand SPOT. So, opting for less granularity I assumed historic CapEX and D&amp;A.  
  


# WACC:

  
***Cost of Equity***  
RFR (1M Avg) = 2.81%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPOT/)) = 1.73  
ERP = Unable to find any reliable analyst’s forecast for ERP, the next best alternative is to take US stable market ERP.  
ERP = 6.48%  
COE = 9.16%  
  
***Cost of Debt***  
SPOT has no bond rating so the next best thing to take is a synthetic rating. But SPOT has been mostly EBIT negative for the past 5 years so we’re unable to take a synthetic rating. As SPOT has no actual bond yield, the next best thing we can do is to take book yield.  
Book Interest Expense = 132M + 53M = 185M  
Book Debt = 1683M  
Book Yield = 11.0%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 20.6%  
AT Book Yield = 8.73%  
  
***Weightage***  
Price (5D Avg) = $157.56  
Shares O/S = 193M  
Market Value of Equity = 30409M  
%Equity = 94.8%  
%Debt = 5.2%  
WACC = 9.14%  


# CONCLUSION:

At base case, I value SPOT at $164.55. I believe that SPOT's future is determined by how much they can break free from the music licensors or whether competitors will find any way to regain the upper hand against SPOT. The advantage that SPOT has is personalized music and spotify connect which competitors could make use of existing AI technology to replicate or create an interchangeable system that allows for cross play on different platforms. The future of SPOT is very volatile with my worst case at $39.47 and best case at $357.93 as their future is very reliant on external unpredictable factors. Due to how volatile it is and with negative earnings historically even a sanity check to find ROIC may not add much to accuracy.

When I first got into investing, my boss at the time advised me on a couple index funds including SDIV.

Do I cut my losses, sell, and put into something better (like what?), OR should I wait it out for the long term and see if it goes up, since it's in the Traditional IRA and I can't withdraw it anyway?

Instacart is reportedly planning to increase its IPO target price range to $28–$30 per share, potentially valuing the company at nearly $10 billion. This comes in the wake of chipmaker Arm's successful IPO, which rejuvenated investor optimism in new listings. Arm's share price jumped over 25% on its debut day, elevating its market cap to around $65 billion and sparking a renewed interest in the startup and IPO market.  
  
While the revised IPO target for Instacart is significant, it's worth noting that this is still a reduction from the company's $39 billion valuation in 2021. The grocery delivery giant, which has secured over $2 billion in venture capital across more than 19 rounds, appears to be strategically capitalizing on the current uplift in market sentiment.

Beginner with individual stocks here.

ADBE's Overall financials look super good in my eyes (growth in free cash flow, revenue etc) and I attempted a simple DCF calculation based on that.

My estimated growth is 14% on it's FCF, and a WAAC of 8%, I ended up with a fair value of $630, which is obviously well above it's current price (pre-market around$635). The current price allows for a margin of 15% which makes me wonder if ADBE at its current price might be attractive to enter a small position.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

FRANKFURT, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank raised its key interest rate to a record peak on Thursday and signalled this will likely be its final move in a more-than year-long fight against stubbornly high inflation.

The central bank for the 20 countries that share the euro also raised its forecasts for inflation, which it now expects to come down more slowly towards its 2% target over the next two years, while cutting its expectations for economic growth.

That illustrated the dilemma the ECB faced at the meeting, with prices still rising at more than twice its target rate but economic activity struggling under high borrowing costs and a downturn in China.

Against this backdrop, the ECB sent a clear message it was probably done raising rates.

""Based on its current assessment, the Governing Council considers that the key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target,"" the ECB said,

This was expected to happen more slowly than at the time of the ECB's previous projections in June, with inflation now seen at 5.6% in 2023, 3.2% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025.

The upgrade to the 2024 estimate - which had been reported by Reuters earlier - was likely to have played a significant role in discussions as policymakers weighed the risk inflation, currently still above 5%, would get stuck at a high level.

Thursday's 25-basis-point increase pushes the rate the ECB pays on bank deposits to 4.0%, the highest level since the euro currency was launched in 1999.

Just 14 months ago, that rate was languishing at a record low of minus 0.5%, meaning banks had to pay to park their cash securely at the central bank.

In the run-up to the meeting, money markets had expected the deposit rate to peak at 4.0% before being cut in the second half of next year. 0#ECBWATCH.

In contrast, markets have fully priced in unchanged rates at next week's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which started raising earlier and has moved higher than the ECB.

ECB President Christine Lagarde will hold a news conference at 1245 GMT.

NEW FORECASTS
Supporters of a hike this week are likely to have argued it was needed because inflation, including underlying measures that strip out volatile components, remained too high, with a recent surge in energy prices threatening a new acceleration.

But the brisk tightening cycle - twice as steep as normally envisaged by the ECB's own stress tests of the banking sector - has already left its mark on the euro zone economy.

With the manufacturing sector, which typically needs more capital to operate, already suffering as a result of higher borrowing costs, lending to companies and households has fallen off a cliff.

Services has now also started to struggle following a brief post-pandemic boom in tourism.

The euro zone's biggest economy, Germany, was bearing the brunt of an industrial slump and heading for recession, according to several forecasts.

Once its rate increases end, the ECB is likely to begin a debate on mopping up more of the cash it pumped into the banking system through various bond-buying schemes over the last decade, although no decision on that matter was expected this week.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ecb-considers-lifting-rates-record-high-even-economy-slows-2023-09-13/""&gt;https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ecb-considers-lifting-rates-record-high-even-economy-slows-2023-09-13/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank raised its key interest rate to a record peak on Thursday and signalled this will likely be its final move in a more-than year-long fight against stubbornly high inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central bank for the 20 countries that share the euro also raised its forecasts for inflation, which it now expects to come down more slowly towards its 2% target over the next two years, while cutting its expectations for economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That illustrated the dilemma the ECB faced at the meeting, with prices still rising at more than twice its target rate but economic activity struggling under high borrowing costs and a downturn in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, the ECB sent a clear message it was probably done raising rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Based on its current assessment, the Governing Council considers that the key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target,&amp;quot; the ECB said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was expected to happen more slowly than at the time of the ECB&amp;#39;s previous projections in June, with inflation now seen at 5.6% in 2023, 3.2% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upgrade to the 2024 estimate - which had been reported by Reuters earlier - was likely to have played a significant role in discussions as policymakers weighed the risk inflation, currently still above 5%, would get stuck at a high level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday&amp;#39;s 25-basis-point increase pushes the rate the ECB pays on bank deposits to 4.0%, the highest level since the euro currency was launched in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just 14 months ago, that rate was languishing at a record low of minus 0.5%, meaning banks had to pay to park their cash securely at the central bank.&lt;/p&gt;

When government yields recently soared (i.e., their prices fell), it raised doubts about banks' balance sheets and caused the company's stock to plummet. In principle, this is not an unreasonable fear to have given that BAC has over $106 billion in unrealized securities losses.  
The level of worry, though, might be a little exaggerated. Despite having a large number of unrealized losses, Bank of America has adequate liquidity. Even after bringing them down to fair value, its highly liquid assets still account for around 50% of its deposit base. In other words, the bank could withstand the sudden withdrawal of 50% of its deposits. Furthermore, the bank's liquidity coverage ratio is 119%, exceeding the required level of 100%.  
Bank of America is a strong bank with a fair valuation. It is making significantly more money than it requires to keep paying dividends and increasing them. While the overall picture appears to be quite enticing so far, investors must be aware of a number of risks and difficulties, including a recession and an inverted yield curve.   
In the yield curve, banks borrow on the short end and lend on the long end. Inverse yield curves hence have a tendency to reduce their margins. Bank of America hasn't yet experienced this in this year, although several smaller banks did when their customers withdrew money to invest in treasuries earlier in the year. These ""black swan"" situations compel banks to increase savings/CD interest rates, which lowers their margins.  
Numerous economists predict a recession for the upcoming year. Although there is less agreement now than there was early in the year that a recession is impending, many analysts still hold this view. If that happens, BAC's earnings will likely decrease because bank earnings often decrease during recessions.  
In light of the dangers and difficulties mentioned above, I believe that Bank of America stock is still a good investment for consistent dividend payment in the years to come.

395,stocks,"Hello r/Stocks,

I have a question that I am hoping someone with knowledge about how ETF rebalances work.   
From what I gather, when a new stock is added to something like the S and P 500, there is an effective date given during the press release of the S and P Global.

During the time from the press release and the effective date, is the S and P 500 index having funds reconstitute their compositions to match the % of the newly added fund? Does this reconstitution happen during the duration from the time of announcement to the inclusion date, or does it happen before market opens on inclusion date? But if it happens before market opens, We should expect to see massive volume and price going up due to the new demand coming in. Often times, we do see massive volume, but the stock may trade sideways or even go down. This leads me to think the volume prior to the inclusion date are the index funds buying.

I know there is also a rebalance date. This is where I am a little confused. During rebalance dates, is that also when funds are forced to change their portfolio to match the % composition of the index representation? Or is it just an audit when that day arrives where funds should already be in the correct positional % of the new inclusions.

I hope my question makes sense, and thank you for anyone who has any information / understanding of this for answering.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;a href=""/r/Stocks""&gt;r/Stocks&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

397,stocks,"Markets seem to be brushing off the acceleration in inflation, but I'm concerned investors might be downplaying its potential fallout.

For the first time in six months, we're seeing a rise in core inflation. A 0.3% month-over-month increase might not sound like much compared to 0.7%, but it's still considerably above the Fed's target.

The 0.6% spike in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) caught me off guard as well. The surge in gasoline prices since early July, up by 9.4%, likely contributed to this development.

As oil prices continue their upward trajectory, we might witness gasoline's significant influence on September-October CPI figures. As I’ve previously pointed out, this isn't a scenario the Fed would appreciate.

All of the above suggests that elevated interest rates might linger longer than many of us would like. Cutting rates at this juncture could trigger a sharp inflationary spike, especially when inflation's descent is already proving sluggish.

The repercussions of these sustained high rates are evident in the rising average interest rate on U.S. government debt. After standing at just 1.56% in January 2022, it shot up to 2.92% in August. Now, new Treasury Bills are being issued at rates exceeding 5%.

This implies that, over the next year, the Treasury's interest payments alone could surpass $1 trillion. While the Treasury might weather this storm by borrowing more, those without the Fed's backing could find themselves in a tighter spot.

The longer these rates persist, the greater the chance of significant economic and market disruptions. Ironically, it might take these very disruptions to prompt a rate reduction.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markets seem to be brushing off the acceleration in inflation, but I&amp;#39;m concerned investors might be downplaying its potential fallout.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;**An Important Shift in Fed Officials’ Rate Stance Is Under Way**

&gt;**Central bank is likely to pause rate increases in September, then take a harder look at whether more are needed**

&gt;**For more than a year, Federal Reserve policy makers were unanimous that they would rather raise interest rates too much than too little—that is how serious they considered the threat of persistently high inflation.**

&gt;**That is changing.**


Full story below:

&gt;Some officials still prefer to err on the side of raising rates too much, reasoning that they can cut them later. Now, though, other officials see risks as more balanced. They worry about raising rates and causing a downturn that turns out to be unnecessary or triggering a new bout of financial turmoil.

&gt;The shift toward a more balanced bias on rates is driven by data showing easing inflation and a less overheated labor market. In addition, the unusually rapid rate increases implemented over the past 1½ years are expected to continue crimping demand in coming months.

&gt;Fed officials raised rates at 11 of their past 12 meetings, most recently in July, to a range between 5.25% and 5.5%, a 22-year high. They appear to be in broad agreement to hold interest rates there at their Sept. 19-20 meeting, giving them more time to see how the economy is responding to increases.

&gt;The bigger debate is what would prompt them to raise rates again in November or December. In June, most officials projected they would need to raise rates by another quarter point this year.

&gt;Projections to be released at the end of the September meeting will likely show that an additional increase is still on the table. But whether they deliver such an increase is an open question. 

&gt;For the past year, officials have placed the burden on evidence of a slowing economy to justify pausing rate increases. As inflation cools, the burden has shifted toward evidence of an accelerating economy to justify higher rates.

&gt;This is apparent from how Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently described the risk that firmer-than-expected economic activity would slow recent progress on inflation. Last month, he twice used the word “could” instead of the more muscular “would” to describe whether the Fed would tighten again. Evidence of stronger growth “could put further progress at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy,” he said in Jackson Hole, Wyo.

&gt;One camp of officials is still anxious about inflation and wants an insurance policy against it by raising rates again this fall. These policy makers worry about ending their tightening campaign only to discover in coming months that it didn’t go far enough. It could be particularly disruptive if financial markets are led to believe inflation and interest rates had flattened out only to learn the opposite.  

&gt;Overtightening is a risk, but “we’ve been underestimating inflation,” Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in an interview last month. “Allowing inflation to be up for longer does carry a cost for the economy.”

&gt;If it turns out such an increase had more of a negative impact than expected, “I’d be more willing to [cut] the rate a little bit faster” next year, she said.

&gt;“I don’t think one more hike would necessarily throw the economy into recession if we did feel that we needed to do one,” Fed governor Christopher Waller said last week. Skipping a September rate rise “does not imply stopping,” Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said.

&gt;Another camp is more supportive of pausing increases. They want to shift the focus from how much higher rates have to go to how long they can stay at current levels. While the economy grew a robust 2.1% annualized in the second quarter and might grow above 3% in this quarter, these officials are skeptical this will be sustained, particularly given slower growth in China and Europe and the lagged impact of past rate rises.

&gt;“The risk of inflation staying higher for longer must now be weighed against the risk that an overly restrictive stance of monetary policy will lead to a greater slowdown than is needed to restore price stability,” said Boston Fed President Susan Collins in a speech last week. “This phase of our policy cycle requires patience.”

&gt;Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note have climbed to around 4.25% from 3.9% since the Fed’s meeting in July, raising an array of borrowing costs, including mortgage rates, which recently hit a 22-year high. That, in effect, does some of the work that a Fed rate increase would be intended to achieve.

&gt;These officials also worry that if one more increase proves unnecessary, reversing it would be more confusing and costly than their more hawkish colleagues appreciate. 

&gt;Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic last month said he would prefer to hold rates at current levels for the next year. As inflation comes down, inflation-adjusted, or “real,” rates will rise. “If we are appropriately cautious, we have the opportunity to minimize the damage that we see on the employment side. That’s not to say there won’t be damage,” he said.

&gt;Measures of underlying inflation that strip out the most volatile price changes have shown a sustained decline this summer. One from the New York Fed dropped below 2.8% in July from a high of 5.5% in June 2022. Other data show the frequency and magnitude of price increases, which accelerated in 2021, have also retreated.

&gt;To be sure, the difference between one more rate increase and none might not be that great in the scheme of things. “Is one going to be right and the other demonstrably wrong? I’m very doubtful,” said Nathan Sheets, a former senior Fed economist who is now chief economist at Citigroup. “What’s left now is fine-tuning.”

&gt;Other economists outside the Fed say spending and growth data can overstate the economy’s strength ahead of a slowdown. “This is how policy accidents always occur: a fixation on backward-looking data,” said Daleep Singh, chief global economist at PGIM Fixed Income.

&gt;“Most of the forward-looking indicators now suggest that while restrictive policy may still be appropriate,” the degree of restraint being delivered by high real rates might soon be “more than this economy can handle,” he said.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known on Wall Street as the &amp;quot;Fed Whisperer,&amp;quot; Nick Timiraos and his news reports at the Wall Street Journal are closely followed due to his deep relationships with officials at the Fed.

416,stocks,"Howdy everyone.

I'm looking to sell a specific stock of mine that I've held for over a year now, but it has an upcoming dividend, so I was wondering...

If I was to hold the stock during its ""ex dividend date &amp; record date"" and the sell it the following day, would I still recieve the dividend in the following weeks when its paid out?? 
I would presume so, and the limited research ive done says yes, but I'd like to hear from others directly :) 
Thanks

Edit: Thanks for all the in depth replies, has been helpful reading them all. I admittedly wasn't aware of the (now noticable) effect dividends have on the shareprice of many stocks, especially ones with high yields. The stock I was referring to dropped a staggering -6% post dividend, which is a decent amount considering the history graph for the stock. I'm wondering if it's a combination of both the effect of the dividend being given out and simply market movement, as that seems like a lot, especially when comparing it to past dividend % and the correlating share price drop.

424,stocks,"I agree with you that IonQ is a speculative stock, but I believe that it has the potential to change the world and impact almost every industry. Here are some of the reasons why:

IonQ is one of the leading companies in the development of trapped ion quantum computers. Trapped ion quantum computers are considered to be one of the most promising types of quantum computers, and they have the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers.

IonQ has made significant progress in developing its quantum computers. In 2022, the company announced that it had achieved quantum supremacy, which means that its quantum computer was able to solve a problem that would be impossible for a classical computer to solve.

IonQ has a strong team of scientists and engineers. The company's founders are all experts in quantum computing, and they have assembled a team of world-class scientists and engineers to help them develop their technology.

IonQ has a number of partnerships with major companies. These partnerships will help IonQ to bring its technology to market and to develop applications for its quantum computers.

Some of the industries that IonQ could impact include:

Drug discovery: Quantum computers could be used to simulate the behavior of molecules, which could help scientists to design new drugs more quickly and efficiently

Materials science: Quantum computers could be used to design new materials with desired properties.

Finance: Quantum computers could be used to develop new financial algorithms that could improve trading strategies and reduce risk.

Cybersecurity: Quantum computers could be used to break current encryption algorithms, which could have a major impact on cybersecurity.

Artificial intelligence: Quantum computers could be used to develop new AI algorithms that are more powerful and efficient than current AI algorithms.

These are just a few of the ways that IonQ could change the world. The company is still in its early stages but progressing much faster than anticipated via tech metrics and logistics therefore it has the potential to make a major impact on many industries.

Of course, there are also risks associated with investing in IonQ which is why you have a well diversified portfolio with some speculative stocks imo.  However, I believe that the potential rewards outweigh the risks.

CorVel Corporation (NASDAQ: CRVL) today announced the release of its initial Generative AI module. A new addition to CorVel’s CogencyIQ® service offerings, the module will leverage machine learning to interpret medical records for adjusters and prompt immediate actions.

Interpreting medical data and determining the next steps in managing a case is critical and time-consuming for adjusters. CorVel’s generative AI model will now read and summarize this often-complex information, provide the summary to the adjusters, and propose actions to be taken. Simultaneously, the extraction of unstructured data from the reports will be highlighted for the claims staff to quickly and efficiently update claim fields in CareMC and ensure the key stakeholders are notified. This innovative solution significantly reduces the adjuster's time commitment to objective tasks and allows them more time to interface directly with injured workers, be more strategic, and ultimately improve outcomes.

The generative AI module is the latest addition to CorVel’s award-winning CareMC claims platform integrated technology system, which delivers a holistic view of all data on a claim and automates routine processes for speed and efficiency.

“Our approach to Generative AI is marked by intentionality, fostering collaborative efforts with our team and partners. Our unwavering commitment lies in leveraging technology to elevate the efforts of our professional staff and improve the outcomes delivered. We also see generative AI as an efficient approach to mitigate labor-related challenges by offering guidance to upcoming generations of professionals,” said Michael Combs, President and CEO, of CorVel.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;CorVel Corporation (NASDAQ: CRVL) today announced the release of its initial Generative AI module.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

They even sell brooms and mops back in the day for $1. Those mops and brooms are still around. When I went off to the dorm room to start 4 years on campus my mom stopped at none other than Dollar Tree and we got some small glass cups with hanldes that I still use to this day regularly.

This was over a decade ago. I love Dollar Tree and the one in my small city is always packed, as is the one I go to monthly in the bigger city 25 miles away. 

My point with this short real life story about DLTR is that whenever you need to save money and not pay $12 for a broom or $18 for each glass (the going rate at what I just found out doing an average of similar glass cups from higher end stores). We are in tough times right now in this market and economy. I am working more hours, as is everyone else I know, and even working 70-80 hours on average a week I barely have enough to break even because cost of living is high.

434,stocks,"Strictly speaking, *Thinking Fast and Slow* is not an investing book, but I've seen it referenced and quoted so many times in other investing books that I simply had to go read it for myself. I'm very glad to say that I had not wasted my time and this is an excellent book on all aspects of decision making. Daniel Kahneman is the foremost expert in the field of decision-making and judgement, even receiving a nobel prize in 2002 for his contributions to the field of behavioural economics. Kahneman covers a lot of ground in this book, but for the purposes of this post, I'll be focusing mainly on what he has to say about our money decisions.  


* ***Anchoring***

The anchoring effect is the tendency for a given number to affect people's estimation of an unknown value, regardless of whether the given number resulted from a dice throw or in-depth calculation.   
Kahneman and his research partner Amos Tversky rigged a wheel of fortune to only land on 10 or 65.

Then they invited university students in for an experiment. First, they spin the wheel, then had the student write down the number it landed on. Afterwards, Kahneman and Tversky asked the students ""Is the percentage of African nations among UN members larger or smaller than the number you just wrote? What is your best guess of the percentage of African nations in the UN?"" Students know that the number was produced by random, the written number should not have any influence on the students' estimation of African nations in the UN. Yet on average, those students who got 10 estimated 25% while those who got 65 estimated 45%. 

In the instance of estimating the intrinsic value of a stock, we are similarly persuaded. **The given number (stock price) will inevitably influence our estimation of the stock's true worth unless we're exceedingly wary. It's for this reason that overpriced stocks look attractive while underpriced stocks look risky.** Despite the fact that we should not let the actual price of a stock influence our calculation of its intrinsic value, most of us can't help but do so due to the anchoring effect. For example, imagine you have a normal plastic bag. If asked, we might say it's worth a nickel at most. However, if the store priced the plastic bag at $1000 and hundreds of people purchased it for that price, we might be persuaded that the plastic bag is worth more when it's not.  


* ***Overconfidence***

System 1 is unconscious and therefore, it isn't able to second-guess and self-evaluate its judgements. Paired with a lazy System 2, it's only too easy for people to form beliefs that lack evidence. **Confidence, contrary to what our intuition says, is not an indication of correctness. In fact, the more confident we are, the more vigilant we should be.** In the case of investing, it's important not to be led astray by overconfidence, both your own and that of investing professionals.

Given the danger and prevalence of overconfidence, Kahneman offers us a thought experiment called the postmortem to help diminish the tendency. Postmortem is where you imagine that the project you're about to embark upon or the business you're about to invest in had failed 15 years down the line. You then take 5-10 minutes to brainstorm how this might have happened. In performing this exercise, you inoculate yourself against overconfidence and create opportunity to pre-empt future mistakes.  


* ***Loss Aversion***

At the core of many of our poor money choices lie loss aversion. The idea is that most people feel the loss of something far more acutely than they feel the gain. Through his research, Kaneman found that the ratio of loss aversion measures out to 1:2 or 1:1.5 on average. This means you must earn $200-$150 to offset the psychological pain of losing $100.

Although it's reasonable to protect wealth more fiercely than pursue gains, many people are loss averse to the point of irrationality. When faced with an offer of ""pay $400 for 95% chance to win $1,000"" OR ""pay $700 to win $1,000 for sure"" most of us would go with the second option. Objectively speaking, 95% chance to win $600 is an excellent deal, yet we are willing to pay a hefty premium to eliminate the negligible chance of losing money.

To resolve this in-equivalency Kahneman recommends taking a broadview perspective when investing. **We are not making a single investment, we are making a number of investments that will average out. Waiting until we come upon an opportunity that offers 100% guarantee to make money means we'll never invest at all.** It may also mean we end up relying solely on bank deposits with returns that fail to keep up with inflation, an inevitable result of loss. Yes, it's likely that some investments will come out at a loss, but as long as you make more good investments than bad, your net result will follow the trend of probability. Meanwhile, if you shy away from good deals, these missed opportunities will gradually accumulate into a big loss.   


* ***Attitude to Risk***

In Kahneman and Tversky's Nobel Prize-winning theory called Prospect Theory, they posited that just as there are diminishing returns for gains, there is a similarly diminishing impact for losses.

Kahneman offers two illustrative problems to explain prospect theory:  
***Problem 1****: Which do you choose?*  
*Get $900 for sure OR 90% chance to get $1,000*  
***Problem 2****: Which do you choose?*  
*Lose $900 for sure OR 90% chance to lose $1,000*

As mentioned in the previous point on Loss Aversion, most people would much prefer to get $900 for sure for Problem 1. What's interesting is that this situation is entirely inverted in Problem 2. All of a sudden, people would prefer a 90% chance to lose $1,000 over a guaranteed loss of $900.

The reason is because going from $900 to $1,000 is an insignificant increase in psychological value and the 10% risk of getting nothing at all is a huge loss. We are unwilling to put $900 on the line for a chance to gain an additional $100, even when the odds of success is 90%. When it comes to gains, we are risk averse.

Meanwhile, going from a sure loss of $900 to a potential loss of $1,000 is precisely the opposite. If we are guaranteed to lose $900, the loss of an additional $100 feels negligible. In exchange for the possibility of losing an additional $100, we gain a 10% chance to lose nothing at all, which has much greater psychological value. When it comes to losses, we are risk seeking.

Why is this important?

**Consider we purchased a stock for $80 a share and it has gone down to $30. We know the company is performing poorly and the economy is entering a recession. The odds that the stock will drop to $20 and stay at that price is 90%. The smart decision is to sell the stock at $30 and reinvest in another stronger company, but because we are risk seeking when faced with loss, we hold on to the stock for that slim 10% chance that it will bounce back to $80 a share.** This is the reason why we hold on to losing stocks and refuse to realize a loss. Selling now and losing $50 for sure feels much worse than a 90% chance to lose an additional $10 and a 10% chance to make it all back.

&amp;#x200B;

**The good:** This book is full of excellent psychological concepts presented alongside compelling examples, both in the form of theoretical thought experiments and actual experiments conducted by experts. Kahneman not only taught me lots of new psychology concepts but also explained familiar concepts (priming, availability heuristic, loss aversion) in a new way so I had a truer, deeper understanding. This book will be of great use to anyone who makes decisions on a regular basis.

**The bad:** As you can imagine, this book goes very fast, especially in the later chapters. It sometimes felt like concepts that deserved its own chapter (or even its own book) are allotted only pages and paragraphs, which is a shame. This book also lacks a clear progression of ideas, it very much feels like a bunch of related but disparate concepts packaged together into a book.

**Personal thoughts:** I really enjoyed this book and I highly recommend it. It's a fairly long read (my edition was 499 pages) and at times rather dense, but it's well worth the time and effort. While writing this review I really struggled to choose which concepts to include and which to leave out because all of the ideas from Thinking Fast and Slow feels so fundamental to the way we make decisions.

If you've read this book too, I would really appreciate it if you drop a mention of something from the book I wasn't able to cover because goodness knows there are a lot.

TSLA is up nearly 10% today.

Morgan Stanley's upgrade of TSLA was a target of $400, up from $250.

Excerpt from the article:

&gt; Tesla has been mentioning how Dojo gives it an edge in AI and self-driving technology since at least 2021. In July this year, CEO Elon Musk told investors that the carmaker plans to invest more than $1 billion on the project by the end of 2024.

&gt; “As a point of reference, in 2022, Nvidia spent $7 billion across the entire company on research and development,” Gene Munster, co-founder and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, wrote in a note in July. “In other words, spending $1 billion plus on a single product is aggressive and speaks to Musk’s urgency at making good on this FSD prediction.”

&gt; Seth Goldstein of Morningstar Research Services LLC says that, “while it’s good for Elon to push the team to go as quickly as possible, in reality Tesla usually sees a delay from Elon’s original timelines.”

&gt; “It doesn’t mean they aren’t making progress,” Goldstein said in a phone interview Monday. “Once Dojo is up and running and takes over the software training, it will allow Tesla to update software more quickly and increase subscriptions at software margins, which can be a big value driver.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headline comes from Bloomberg &lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-surge-thanks-dojo-supercomputer-032644640.html""&gt;(yahoo link)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Very excited about potential of Globalstar ($GSAT) with new CEO, Paul Jacobs, former CEO of Qualcomm

I believe Globalstar Inc. (GSAT) is poised for significant growth in the next 6 months, and there are several compelling factors to support my bullish outlook:

Stellar Leadership: Globalstar has made a brilliant strategic move by appointing Paul E. Jacobs, the former CEO of Qualcomm, as its new CEO. Jacobs brings a wealth of experience and a strong network in the technology industry. His leadership can be a game-changer, as reported by Fierce Wireless, Seeking Alpha, and Reuters. His track record suggests he can navigate the company toward innovation and expansion.

SpaceX Collaboration: Globalstar has chosen to collaborate with SpaceX, one of the most renowned companies in the space industry, to upgrade its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation. This partnership, as highlighted in SpaceNews, holds immense promise. It demonstrates Globalstar's commitment to enhancing its infrastructure, which can lead to improved satellite communication services. With the space sector booming, this collaboration puts Globalstar in a prime position to capitalize on the increasing demand for satellite-based services.

Yields are skyhigh, the ECB might hike once more this week as Inflation here is not going down fast enough. And the markets? Well they are pretty damn high, today TSLA went up 10% again, thats just the icing on the cake.

Now nobody can predict if all this will again lead to a repricing, (which looking at all the data in the past is the highly expected outcome...) anytime soon, but what I can say for 100% is that yields are paying you again.

Morgan Stanley has given Tesla's stock a substantial boost, citing the potential of the company's newly launched supercomputer, Dojo. The Wall Street bank believes Dojo could add up to $500 billion to Tesla's enterprise value, primarily by accelerating the development of robotaxis and network services. This optimism led to a more than 5% surge in Tesla’s premarket stock price and prompted the bank's analysts to upgrade the stock from Equal-Weight to Overweight.  
  
Dojo is aimed at enhancing Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology, positioning the automaker at an ""asymmetric advantage"" in a multi-trillion dollar market. The bullish outlook by Morgan Stanley provides a welcome lift for Tesla, which had faced a volatile stock performance and recently cut prices on some models. Despite these challenges, Tesla’s shares are up about 130% in 2023, indicating a strong rebound and promising prospects for further growth.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://tokenist.com/tesla-gains-in-premarket-as-analysts-say-dojo-offers-asymmetric-advantage/""&gt;https://tokenist.com/tesla-gains-in-premarket-as-analysts-say-dojo-offers-asymmetric-advantage/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

454,stocks,"Hey all, I retired recently at age 55 and have been pondering about my investment strategy for the coming years. Specifically, I'm caught between rebalancing my current tech-heavy portfolio, adding AAPL to the mix, or just simplifying life by moving everything into QQQ. 

This particular portfolio makes up around 30% of my total retirement savings, and I plan to start drawing it down slowly in about 2 years.  
  
My Current Portfolio

  
MSFT: \~75%  
AMZN: \~9%  
NVDA: \~8%  
TSLA: \~6%  
GOOG: \~1%  
Some Context:  
I earned my MSFT shares during my career there and am pretty bullish on their future, hence the big slice of the pie they occupy. I added the TSLA in 2016 and sold a few when it had a big gain but again I'm bullish on them. Most of the stocks have been held for at least 3 years.  
  
So, what are your thoughts?  
  
Should I rebalance these existing stocks?  
Should I consider adding AAPL to diversify a bit within the tech sector?  
Or should I just move it all into QQQ for ease of management?

  
Just seeking opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

If I don't simplify now I will need to in the coming years. I have a couple of years of cash equivalents available and will rebalance annually.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not keen to just put it all in in an S&amp;P tracker or whatever as I believe tech will out perform for the foreseeable future. Also much of the rest of my retirement fund is well diversified in managed funds I can't touch yet due to tax/age.

&gt;Jelly maker J.M. Smucker is buying Twinkie owner Hostess Brands for $5.6 billion, or $34.25 a share. Hostess shareholders will receive $30 in cash and .03002 shares of Smucker’s stock for each share of Hostess that they owned. Smucker has also agreed to assume Hostess’s debt.

But the company’s shares had already received a significant boost after Reuters reported in late August that it was considering a sale after fielding interest from large food companies, including PepsiCo and Oreo maker Mondelez International.

Stocks I'm looking for need to have standard market legislative risks and be profitable. This should filter out many where it would be difficult to distinguish an 'unethical' discount versus a legislative risk discount.

Looking at valuations of several of the traditional &amp;#39;sin&amp;#39; stocks though I do not really see this discount being priced in as markets also have to price in legislative risk which is very difficult (based on simple valuation models future expected FCF/earnings yields are not absurdly high in comparison to the legislative risk posed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks I&amp;#39;m looking for need to have standard market legislative risks and be profitable. This should filter out many where it would be difficult to distinguish an &amp;#39;unethical&amp;#39; discount versus a legislative risk discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So fossil fuels, private prisons and tobbaco directly are ruled out while alcohol, pharma, weapons and gambling sector wise should (but up for discussion) follow this framework. What stocks would you include in such an index?&lt;/p&gt;

However, keeping the Wii U in mind, there is a risk of these innovations and novelties not appealing to the wide market. They did believe in the idea though, and refined the Wii U into the Switch. Which in turn is a success.

But there might be some unrefined ideas in the possible VR headset, and possibly this “Switch 2” console.

&amp;#x200B;


I have recently added British American Tobacco to my portfolio as I believe that its current share price presents an exceptionally compelling risk-reward proposition when weighed against alternative investment opportunities. Following is a concise summary of my reasoning that I would like to present for your feedback.

  
**THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES ARE TO BE FOUND IN BEAR MARKETS**  
Sooner or later, regardless of how exceptional they are, companies find themselves in the midst of multi-year downturns. It happened to Coca Cola, PepsiCo, Microsoft, and Apple, just to name a few.  
The only time British American Tobacco has been cheaper than today was at the end of the largest civil litigation settlement in U.S. history, which resulted in the tobacco companies paying the states and territories billions of dollars in yearly instalments. *It went then on to become a* ***15-bagger*** *over the subsequent 17 years,* ***not accounting for dividends***.  
Now, the company does currently face noteworthy challenges (i.e. negative secular trends in smoking and a substantial debt burden), but the current valuation seems to be factoring in a higher level of risk than may actually exist.
  
**DECLINING SMOKING RATES**  
Even though smoking rates continue to decline, the company is effectively offsetting the trend through a successful diversification of its product portfolio. The oligopolistic nature of tobacco markets also gives them significant pricing power, especially since demand for their products is relatively inelastic, resulting in inordinate profitability and robust cash flows.
  
**DEBT BURDEN**  
The company has debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years, and due to higher interest rates, net finance costs are expected to increase as debts are refinanced.  
However, it currently holds about £4 billion in cash, expects to generate at least an additional £5+ billion in post-dividend free cash flow, and had access to an undrawn £5.5 billion revolving credit facility as of 30 June 2023. This sums up to more than £14 billion in liquidity available to meet its debt obligations within the specified time frame. Contrary to claims of insolvency, the company's financials demonstrate otherwise.

  
**HEADS I WIN, TAILS I...STILL WIN**  
It does not happen very often that companies with cash flows so consistent and predictable offer a ***FCF yield of 17%***. Not to mention the fact that they're still growing earnings and that a multiple expansion is not unlikely over the next decade (In 2000, the company traded at just 7x earnings before eventually returning to its historical norm of 13 to 14x).  
This is an ***immensely-wide moat and non-cyclical stock*** ***currently paying a 9% dividend yield*** with a conservative 60% earnings payout ratio and a well-established track record of dividend payments spanning many decades. Investors are getting average stock market returns from the dividend alone.

*""Disney and Charter Communications are locked in what, at first glance, appears to be a simple negotiation over price. But the dispute over how much cable giant Charter should pay to broadcast Disney’s cable channels, which include ESPN, National Geographic, and FX, is unusual and likely to set a precedent for the media industry. ""*

Charter cable is now showing notificaitons to its millions of customers that they **have partnered with $FUBO, and customers get a free trial.** not sure if i can post screenshots here, but stock twits users have been posting all sorts of screenshots for sometime now.

While, Disney and Charter may resolve their dispute and get back to a working deal, this has proven to be a free, targeted (to all ESPN fans) promotion of $FUBO.

And quite a well known tactic in subscription world - free trial to paid subscribers to long term users.

And if the dispute doesn't get resolved, even better for $FUBO.

This company has shown consistent revenue growth from \~$5M in Sep 2019 to \~$313M in Jun 2023 -

[https://ycharts.com/companies/FUBO/revenues](https://ycharts.com/companies/FUBO/revenues)

User base has grown significantly. While costs remain a concern, a sudden influx of users seem likely this quarter and might help it in the future.

Consumers do have other choices as mentioned in the fortune article -

1. switching to other cable that has Disney packs
2. youtube tv
3. hulu + live

So not a huge % of customers will go to $FUBO. But with free trial they will at least get introduced to the service, increasing the probability that they will turn into subscribers.

Also, there is another angle of cable vs streaming -

""

*Charter wants to use Disney to transform its cable business by creating a new type of cable bundle that also includes streaming. If Charter doesn’t prevail it may simply walk away from its cable business, because it says it can’t make the numbers work otherwise.*

*“We have already reached the point of economic indifference with the current model,” the company said in an investor presentation, using jargon that masks the threat of entirely pulling out of one of its core businesses.*

""

If Charter wants to offer cable + streaming, and if they don't want to be hostage to Disney's asks in the future, would they be better off just by buying out $FUBO as it's at lower valuation anyway ? As Charter has already shown trust in $FUBO by partnering with them over other streaming services (apart from $DIS), wouldn't that be logical (while economical needs to be tested) if they anyway want this new business model ?

Was surprised to read in next para that Charter's revenue was $17B in 2022. While cable business is in decline, Charter seem to be quite big enough to acquire $FUBO right away.

What do you think, how will this play out ? Thanks for sharing your thoughts!

Disclosure - I am long $FUBO.

470,stocks,"My portfolio is up 50% this year.  I have a portfolio that is 100% growth stocks and I’ve taken some time to look at valuations to evaluate if I have companies that seem to be over their skis in terms of valuation.

I’ve been looking at lots of stocks in terms of reverse dfc and it seems to me that MercadoLibre is undervalued by about 50%.  They are still growing sales by more than 30% y/y and are improving their operating margin by increasing take rates and reducing costs.  They turn out outstanding results quarter after quarter and when faced with competitive threats from players such as Amazon and Shopee, they just keep coming out on top.

I have a somewhat focused portfolio of 9 stocks, but with the numbers I’m seeing, I just really want to put everything into MercadoLibre (not that I have a big portfolio - just around 30k)

Every other growth stock I evaluate seems either overvalued or reasonably valued, taking into account ten years of reasonable growth assumptions.  Take Nvidia for example.  I own Nvidia and based on my reverse DCF, if they can grow FCF by 30% for ten years, the stock is currently fairly valued.  I think they might be able to pull that off, so Nvidia might be worth owning.

But according to the same model, MercadoLibre only needs to grow FCF 11% annually over the next 10 years to justify their current valution.  This just seems like an absurdly low bar for them.

If my model is off, it would be off in the same direction for all the companies im evaluating.  Part of me thinks I should just invest in this one company that has both amazing fundamentals and low valuation.  Another part of me is just saying “hell no!  Always stay diversified!”

It’s like Cramer vs Munger in my head.  One voice says “5 stocks minimum”. The other says, “why buy anything but your best idea?”  Peter Lynch is also in my head.  I live in Mexico and use Mercado Libre’s services, so it’s a company I can get behind on a personal level.  I think Lynch would approve.

I’ve just never put all my money into one stock before, but this seems like an insane bargain.

Nearly a third of all outstanding US government debt is set to mature in the next 12 months, according to an analysis from asset management firm Apollo. A chart from Chief Economist Torsten Sløk shows that the share of US public debt set to mature in a year or less has steadily risen toward pandemic-era levels and is now at 31%. In terms of dollar amount, that's $7.6 trillion, a high not seen since early 2021. In addition, public debt maturing in the near term accounts for more than a quarter of US GDP. However, this is below its 2020 peak, when it made up a significantly larger share. Still, Sløk said the $7.6 trillion coming due is one source of upward pressure on US rates.

The estimate comes as federal deficits have exploded in recent years, sharply elevating the trajectory of US debt. The Treasury Department has already auctioned $1 trillion in bonds just within this quarter. Meanwhile, borrowing costs have soared in the last year and a half as the Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive tightening campaign, raising the government's debt-servicing costs. As of Friday afternoon, the 10-year Treasury yield stood at 4.25%, and three-month yield was 5.47%. Rates have also been under pressure from the Fed's quantitative tightening program, which removed a top buyer from the bond market.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-6-trillion-us-government-040643412.html""&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-6-trillion-us-government-040643412.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

480,stocks,"Imagine this: You're the CEO of a public company, and those dreaded quarterly reports are just around the corner. But here's the catch — your company's revenue isn't looking so hot. Panic mode sets in! ☠

What do you do? You need extra revenue, and you need it fast! So, you come up with a ""brilliant"" idea. 💡

You find a partner, you invest in them, and in return, they magically **""buy""** your product. Voilà! You've got revenue, albeit a bit inflated.

This nifty maneuver is what we call a **""boomerang"" transaction**, and it fits the name perfectly, right?

Enter Michael Saylor, the current Bitcoin hero, was the unsung hero of the early 2000s internet boom. Many of you may not know but, he ran a tech company that soared to the heavens with a massively successful IPO, making him a billionaire at just 34.

But here's the **twist**:

Behind the scenes, the quarterly and annual reports were like a magician's trick, filled with carefully crafted financial shenanigans like the ""boomerang"" transactions, **made just before the period** ended.

As long as there was no Sherlock Holmes-level auditing, Michael Saylor was living the American dream to the max!

But then came Forbes (yes, they were lit back then). They dropped the bomb, and PwC audited everything, exposing the grand scheme.

Michael called it ""material accounting irregularities,"" but the market wasn't feeling generous. In a single day, the share price nosedived by a jaw-dropping 60%, and it finally hit rock bottom at $1.75. Ouch!

Now, we're left wondering whether Michael Saylor is still pulling these shenanigans. Only time will spill the beans.

**Moral** of the story, my fellow investors: Don't underestimate those SEC filing reports like 10K and 8K's, even if they're a tad bit boring, especially the footnotes and understand their revenue recognition practices. Your hard-earned money deserves nothing less! 💼💰

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

&lt;p&gt;Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you&amp;#39;re holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Shares of AMC Entertainment fell sharply on Wednesday after the theater chain said in a filing that it plans to sell up to 40 million new shares to raise cash.

The stock dropped 36.8%, bringing it to $8.62 per share. On a split-adjusted basis, that is AMC’s lowest close on record, according to FactSet.

AMC was widely expected to sell additional shares after the successful conversion of the preferred APE shares into AMC common stock in August. It followed the settlement of a lawsuit objecting to the move.

The theater chain sold millions of shares of common stock in recent years after becoming one of the so-called meme stocks popular with retail traders. The sales helped AMC stabilize itself after the Covid pandemic effectively halted the theatrical movie business.

However, AMC used up its allotment of stock and needed shareholder approval to issue more. The company issued the preferred APE shares as part of a strategy to change its corporate voting structure and get shareholder approval to sell additional common stock.

AMC said in the filing Wednesday that it will sell the new shares through “at-the-market” offerings, without a specific time frame. Citigroup, Barclays, B. Riley Securities and Goldman Sachs are listed as sales agents in the filing.

The U.S. movie business remains below pre-pandemic levels, and the ongoing strikes in Hollywood have clouded the release slate for the rest of 2023 and 2024. AMC and pop star Taylor Swift announced last week that the theater chain is serving as the distributor for a concert movie of The Eras Tour to be released in October.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link: &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/06/amc-shares-fall-as-it-announces-plan-to-sell-additional-stock.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/06/amc-shares-fall-as-it-announces-plan-to-sell-additional-stock.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That being said I've been fine tuning the valuation metrics I use when deciding on stocks to buy. Learning a bit more every day. The one thing I'm starting to struggle with is weighing them when it comes to decision-making. So I'll start with the metrics I'm using:

Debt to Equity (Generally 2 or less)

Price to book (1.5 or less)

Price to Earnings (15 or less) (or better: Earnings Yield - 1/15 = 6.67 or greater)

Dividend Yield (3% ot greater)

Price to Sales - less than 1

Metrics relative to the industry in terms of percentile the company is in for said metric (P/B, P/E, P/S, EV, FCF, profit margin, and ROI)

Warner Bros. Discovery has lowered its 2023 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) forecast to $10.5 billion to $11.0 billion, a hit of $300 million to $500 million, “predominantly due to the impact of the strikes,” compared with the previously targeted low end of the $11.0 billion to $11.5 billion range. In a regulatory filing Tuesday, the company — led by CEO David Zaslav, who has been very engaged in negotiating with Hollywood unions to end the work stoppage — didn’t detail when it expects the strikes could end, but updated its guidance that had previously assumed they would be resolved by early September, as management had mentioned during its second-quarter earnings conference call.

Here is a detailed look at WBD’s revised full-year 2023 guidance: WBD’s filing said it was now “expecting lower adjusted EBITDA” for the full year in the range of $10.5 billion to $11 billion, “reflecting the company’s assumption that adjusted EBITDA will be negatively impacted by approximately $300 million-$500 million, predominantly due to the impact of the strikes.”  The company also raised its free cash flow expectations for the full year to at least $5 billion. “Further, the company now expects to exceed $1.7 billion in free cash flow for the third quarter of 2023, in part due to the strong performance of Barbie as well as incremental impact from strike-related factors,” the filing said. The company is maintaining its expectation of achieving net leverage below 4.0x by the end of 2023, though, as well as its target gross leverage range of 2.5x-3.0x by the end of 2024.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-strikes-earnings-impact-2023-1235581943/""&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-strikes-earnings-impact-2023-1235581943/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

501,stocks,"**China plans to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in sensitive departments** to government-backed agencies and state companies, a sign of growing challenges for Apple Inc. in its biggest foreign market and global production base.

Several agencies have begun instructing staff not to bring their iPhones to work, people familiar with the matter said, affirming a previous report from the Wall Street Journal. In addition, **Beijing intends to extend that restriction far more broadly to a plethora of state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled organizations**, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter.

If Beijing goes ahead, **the unprecedented blockade will be the culmination of a yearslong effort to root out foreign technology use** in sensitive environments, coinciding with Beijing’s effort to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry. It **threatens to erode Apple’s position in a market that yields about a fifth of its revenue**, and from where it makes the majority of the world’s iPhones through sprawling factories that employ millions of Chinese.

Chinese state firms like oil giant PetroChina Co. employ millions and control vast swathes of a centrally planned economy. Given Apple’s relationship with Beijing and its importance to the economy, it “has historically been viewed as relatively safe in China from government restrictions,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel said in a report Wednesday. “Is the government changing its stance?”

A representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. The State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and the State Council Information Office didn’t respond to faxed requests for comment.

503,stocks,"Block, Inc. (SQ) received a downgrade from UBS, shifting its rating from ""Buy"" to ""Neutral"" and significantly reducing the price target from $102 to $65.   
  
The downgrade was driven by concerns about the limited upside potential for Block, particularly in terms of its digital payment platform. UBS analysts cited a focus on gross profit growth as a key area of concern for investors. They also connected the slowing gross profit growth to a softening in consumer discretionary spending, suggesting that this trend could negatively impact the company's performance.  
  
Despite the downgrade, it's noteworthy that the stock initially saw more significant declines in premarket trading but had stabilized to a 0.25% decrease at the time of the discussion.  
  
The stock's current valuation was mentioned, with shares trading near a five-year low in terms of certain multiples. The downgrade was seen as reflecting the anticipation of a slowdown in gross profit growth, which had already been priced into the stock.  
  
SQ does not look good. Not good at all.. too many times it has sunk below 60 which means 60 will end up becoming resistance and this will drop below, much much below.  
  
I’ve owned this stock for quite a long time, but two things they’ve done since that really bother me:   
1. Changed their name to Block and 2. Responsible for making the world have to tip on EVERYTHING. Seeing a monitor spin around at me with “asking you a question” when buying a brownie or apple juice makes me sour.  
  
I have also owned some small capital fintech stocks and trust me as compared to SQ they have performed better. Stocks like HIVE SOFI OLB have given me a decent return as compared to SQ  
  
OLB is worth just $10.63 million in the stock market, but it made nearly $31 million in sales last year.  
  
Whereas SoFi Technologies had revenue of $1.85B in the twelve months ending June 30, 2023, with 48.01% growth year-over-year.  
  
SQ really needs to hurry up and do a better job of connecting the ecosystems together. They've been talking it up now for well over a year and still, there has not been huge progress in terms of surfacing local square merchants in the cash app and incentivizing more purchases with those merchants either through cash card or through after-pay. Dorsey has spoken recently that he is a bit disappointed with the progress they've made to date there and they really do need to pull the finger out and get moving.  
  
But still, I think SQ will be close to going up. It could go lower and if it does, then it is, perhaps a punchline to set the stage for a stronger rebound I hope, so I think it is an accumulation opportunity.

We define these non-GAAP financial measures as the respective U.S. GAAP measures, excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation expense-related charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We believe that it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expense-related charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies over multiple periods. In periods of net loss, we calculate non-GAAP net income (loss) per share by using non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by basic weighted average shares for the period regardless of whether we are in a non-GAAP net income or (loss) position and assuming that all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive.  
  
In addition, the press release and the accompanying tables contain free cash flow which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software. We believe that free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity as it measures our ability to generate cash, or our need to access additional sources of cash, to fund operations and investments. We expect our free cash flow to fluctuate in future periods with changes in our operating expenses and as we continue to invest in our growth. We typically experience higher billings in the fourth quarter compared to other quarters and experience higher collections of accounts receivable in the first half of the year, which results in a decrease in accounts receivable in the first half of the year.  
  
However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. As a result, our non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP.  
  
Sprinklr has not reconciled its financial outlook expectations as to non-GAAP operating income, or as to non-GAAP net income per share, to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures as a result of the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures; in particular, the measures and effects of stock-based compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our stock price. We expect the variability of the above charges to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP financial results. Accordingly, reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort, although it is important to note that these factors could be material to Sprinklr’s results computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure why there is no rockets AH, it even went down 1% AH.&lt;/p&gt;

Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is hoping to move towards a one-hour settlement cycle as early as March next year and instantaneous settlement by October 2024, SEBI chief Madhabi Puri Buch said on Tuesday at the sidelines of the Global Fintech Fest 2023.  
  
India completed the transition to the T+1 settlement cycle in January this year. For instance, a client buying shares on Tuesday under T+1 system gets his shares credited to his demat account on Wednesday. Under the one-hour settlement, this transaction would take place within an hour.  
  
“The technology for implementing the one-hour settlement cycle already exists. The industry is working on a new technology for instantaneous settlement,” said Buch.  
  
To boot, the ASBA-like settlement mechanism for secondary trades will go for pilot testing in December and will be up and running in January. This is similar to the Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA)-like facility that is operational in the primary market which ensures that investor money moves only when allotment happens.  
  
Cyber security  
SEBI is also beefing up systems to deal with broker and exchange or clearing corporation (CC) failures. The exchanges and CCs have implemented a software-as-a-service model in order to ensure that trading continues in the event one exchange or CC goes down.  
  
Data of one exchange will now physically reside on the premises of the second exchange and will be instantaneously updated in real time.   
“So if one clearing corporation or exchange goes down, that data is taken and actually uploaded into the software system of the second exchange,” the SEBI chief said  
  
The regulator is also working on a mechanism that will allow clients of a broker to have direct access to the exchange in order to manage and close out his positions, in case the broker goes down.  
  
Buch referred to these two mechanisms as non-classical approach to cyber security.  
  
Backing AI usage  
The regulator will turn to artificial intelligence and algorithmic alerts to identify mis-selling in the financial ecosystem. “We have built algos but haven’t applied AI. We are hoping that some of our young colleagues are able to develop it in-house,” said Buch.  
  
The existing financial players are undergoing massive transformation and morphing more and more into fintech companies, Buch said.  
  
  
“To us, a stock exchange is a fintech company. Mutual fund platform MF Central is nothing but a fintech in terms of its substance. This morphing of incumbents has a huge advantage. They have the cash flows, manpower, and the stability of the traditional businesses. Yet, when they put their minds to it and apply the principles of modern technology, they transform into this new rocket ships,” she said.

U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile US said on Wednesday it has authorized a shareholder return program of up to $19 billion that will run through December 31, 2024. The company intends to declare and pay its first dividend of approximately $750 million in Q4 2023, as part of the return program.

Comcast and Disney have modified their Hulu agreement to enable the expected buyout of Comcast’s one-third stake in the streamer to begin on September 30 instead of next January. The news was shared at a Goldman Sachs conference appearance by Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, who said the initial minimum valuation of $27.5 billion for Hulu agreed to in 2019 was “just a hypothetical.” He suggested the final price tag could be much higher. Roberts said both companies “wanted to get this behind us,” so they reached an agreement last week to accelerate the timeline.

On September 30, Disney can “put” and Comcast can “call,” which starts the process of the one-third stake moving to Disney. Each company will have its own appraiser and then there will be third-party appraisers, so the process could take some time. Roberts said both companies “are well-served to have clarity for investors about what this really means,” so it shouldn’t drag on too long. The put/call provision was part of the 2019 operational takeover of Hulu by Disney in 2019 in the wake of the $71.3 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox. Founded in 2007, Hulu was always a joint venture, in its later years among Fox, Disney and Comcast/NBCUniversal. While Disney and Comcast have publicly floated the scenario of Comcast buying out Disney’s share, the process has followed the more widely expected path of Disney rolling up full control.

Roberts emphasized that the $27.5 billion minimum valuation “that people have bandied about was just a hypothetical” and will likely to end up far higher. Hulu is “a scarce, kingmaker asset,” he asserted, and worth “way more today than it was” when the parties agreed to the five-year timeline. “Netflix and Hulu are in a class by themselves” as stand-alone streaming outlets, Roberts said. Citing Nielsen data, he said engagement on Hulu is “two to three times” that of rival streamers except for Netflix.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://deadline.com/2023/09/hulu-disney-comcast-stake-sale-timeline-moved-up-streaming-billion-1235537919/""&gt;https://deadline.com/2023/09/hulu-disney-comcast-stake-sale-timeline-moved-up-streaming-billion-1235537919/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

523,stocks,"The aerospace division of Ball Corporation will be acquired by BAE Systems plc in an all-cash deal valued at $5.55 billion, the company has announced. The multiple, which appears to be reasonable value for a business that is fairly high growth and cash producing and enhances BAE's exposure to intelligence systems with a particular focus on satellite and geospatial intelligence systems, is not being well received by the markets. When a tax gain for BAE related with the purchase is considered, the valuation appears more reasonable. However, when this benefit is taken into account along with Ball Aerospace's growth trajectory, things actually look very excellent. Ball Corporation's accession to the BAE portfolio expands segments that are experiencing secular growth and is not the result of inefficient capital allocation.  
The tax benefits associated with the Ball transaction have caused the projected price to drop from about $5.5 billion to $4.8 billion. Without synergies, the multiple is estimated to be roughly 15.4x EV/EBITDA. If synergies exist, that multiple can decrease by another 10%. Ball's aerospace sector, which focuses on satellites and geospatial intelligence as well as other sensors and intelligence systems, is not particularly inexpensive but its CAGR is strong enough to justify a double-digit multiple.  
However, considering the more than 4% price drops of BAE Systems since opening, investors have some concerns. Based on the current valuation change, that implies dis-synergy and/or overpayment in the acquisition of around $1.7 billion. $3.5% of $4.8 billion is $1.7 billion. Given that even 15.4x is not that far of a stretch, there is no possibility that a reasonable consideration for Ball would be $3 billion, or in other words, that BAE overpaid by 50%.  
Nevertheless, it makes sense for BAE Systems plc to be increasing internal C&amp;I investment while also engaging in some M&amp;A to mature the firm and position them to offer a next-generation suite of defence technology. As a result, the markets' apparent overreaction to the price decline is significant.

However, when this benefit is taken into account along with Ball Aerospace&amp;#39;s growth trajectory, things actually look very excellent. Ball Corporation&amp;#39;s accession to the BAE portfolio expands segments that are experiencing secular growth and is not the result of inefficient capital allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tax benefits associated with the Ball transaction have caused the projected price to drop from about $5.5 billion to $4.8 billion. Without synergies, the multiple is estimated to be roughly 15.4x EV/EBITDA. If synergies exist, that multiple can decrease by another 10%. Ball&amp;#39;s aerospace sector, which focuses on satellites and geospatial intelligence as well as other sensors and intelligence systems, is not particularly inexpensive but its CAGR is strong enough to justify a double-digit multiple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, considering the more than 4% price drops of BAE Systems since opening, investors have some concerns. Based on the current valuation change, that implies dis-synergy and/or overpayment in the acquisition of around $1.7 billion. $3.5% of $4.8 billion is $1.7 billion. Given that even 15.4x is not that far of a stretch, there is no possibility that a reasonable consideration for Ball would be $3 billion, or in other words, that BAE overpaid by 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it makes sense for BAE Systems plc to be increasing internal C&amp;amp;I investment while also engaging in some M&amp;amp;A to mature the firm and position them to offer a next-generation suite of defence technology. As a result, the markets&amp;#39; apparent overreaction to the price decline is significant.&lt;/p&gt;

\*\*\*\*\*

Investors are racing to find the clean-energy startups best positioned to capitalize on last year’s landmark climate law. Many are betting on an industry that is seen as crucial to the U.S. ending its reliance on China for batteries.   
  
Major investors including BlackRock BLK -1.45%decrease; red down pointing triangle and Goldman Sachs Asset Management are pouring money into battery recycling, the nascent business of producing reusable battery parts for electric vehicles from scrap metal or old batteries. They are anticipating the startups will survive a turbulent market for clean-energy companies and remain in demand once government incentives dry up.    
  
“That’s the world these companies have to eventually thrive in commercially: one that doesn’t rely on significant subsidies or government support,” said Meghan Sharp, global head of Decarbonization Partners, a joint venture between BlackRock and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings that has raised $1 billion for its first fund and plans to finish fundraising for it this year.   
  
The latest wager is on Ascend Elements, a battery-recycling startup that said it raised $460 million in a financing round that included Decarbonization Partners, mining giant BHP and Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco. The funding round values the company at roughly $1.5 billion.

Last week, rival recycling startup Redwood Materials said it raised $1 billion in a funding round that included Goldman Sachs Asset Management. That put the Nevada-based company’s valuation at more than $5 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.   
  
The investments are among the largest for clean-energy startups this year after battery companies became seen as big winners from the Inflation Reduction Act. Among the incentives giving recyclers and others a boost: tax credits for electric vehicles that are tied to how much material comes from domestic suppliers or trade partners.  
  
Recycling and processing of battery materials are seen as vital industries for the U.S., where environmental opposition and permitting hurdles make the mining of minerals such as nickel and lithium more challenging. China is the top player in the electric-vehicle supply chain, a dominance the U.S. is hoping to shake.  
  
Like many other clean-energy companies, most battery recyclers aren’t yet profitable.   
  
  
That wasn’t a problem for most startups just a few years ago, when interest rates were low and investors were piling into the clean-energy industry. Much of that money has dried up, leaving many startups in areas including indoor farming and electric cars struggling to survive.   
  
Several have filed for bankruptcy in recent weeks, including electric-truck startup Lordstown Motors, indoor-agriculture firm AppHarvest and electric-bus maker Proterra.   
  
The new bets on recycling show that many investors view it as more promising than other early-stage climate industries. The tax incentives for electric cars using domestically sourced parts are brightening Ascend’s business prospects. Recyclers can also take in scrap material as big battery plants expand their operations, an additional boost.   
  
“All of a sudden, it’s really shifted the demand,” said Ascend CEO Mike O’Kronley. “We see this gigantic wave of battery factories coming soon…There needs to be processing capacity on line available to receive that material.”  
  
The Westborough, Mass.-based company was identified last year as a candidate for roughly $480 million in federal grants for battery-material suppliers that were part of the 2021 infrastructure law. Ascend plans to use the grants and its new funding to complete a factory in Kentucky and become profitable soon after it is fully operational in 2025. The company recently signed a $1 billion supply agreement with an undisclosed U.S. customer.  
  
Ascend’s existing investors include South Korea’s SK, one of the world’s biggest battery makers and a major investor in U.S. factories following the climate law.   
  
Other battery recyclers are expecting to benefit from the climate law as well after getting commitments for government loans. Publicly traded Li-Cycle Holdings is expanding a factory in Rochester, N.Y. Redwood, run by Tesla’s former chief technology officer JB Straubel, is building out its Nevada operations and investing $3.5 billion in a new South Carolina plant.   
  
Another perk for clean-energy startups in the climate law: a new market that lets unprofitable companies sell their tax credits to big banks or other businesses.   
  
Renewable-energy developer Invenergy recently agreed to sell $580 million in wind-energy tax credits to Bank of America and used the transaction to raise debt from a group of banks. Similar deals could give companies more funding options.   
  
“You will see more transactions coming soon,” said Meghan Schultz, Invenergy’s chief financial officer.

The prospect of podcast riches led to aggressive investments in celebrity deals and original programming for what appeared a sky’s-the-limit media frontier  
Spotify spent more than $1 billion to build a podcasting empire. It struck splashy deals with Kim Kardashian, the Obamas and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It paid $286 million for a pair of podcast studios and spent $250,000 and more an episode on exclusive shows to lure new listeners.  
The bet hasn’t paid off.   
Most of its shows aren’t profitable, according to people familiar with the matter, and the company has recently cut staff and programming to slow its losses. The company, which has struggled to report consistent profits, lost €527 million, equivalent to about $565 million, in the six months ending in June, on €6.2 billion in revenue.   
No one in the business is making much money on podcasts, but Spotify, which has spent far more on the medium than its rivals, has more to lose than most. Spotify’s competitors, including Amazon, Apple and Google, tech behemoths with their own audiostreaming services, have other, more profitable businesses.

How can you use this to your advantage? It causes enormous volatility when it happens, and that volatility sometimes makes no rational sense.

Why is the volatility happening? ***Lots of fund managers are nothing more than closet indexers.*** They buy or sell an index for their clients, and make a couple tweaks so they can say ""Look! I'm doing something! You need me.. for some reason!""

[Take a look at this article, which details which stocks were added and which were bumped to a smaller index, or bumped off an index entirely.](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/0f4b116c-8985-3e04-adc1-2783f1691f6e/airbnb-blackstone-rise-on.html)

Look at the winners and losers. It's pretty stark. The ones that got promoted to a bigger index or added to an index are up on the day, some quite a lot. The losers are mostly down, some in the double digits. Some are down 25% !

How does this help you ***as an investor?***

Well, it might or might not. Do you know any of these companies? Have you researched them? Do you own any? I do. I own one. **I know it well enough to know** ***this daily volatility means nothing to the business.*** There's nothing wrong with the business.

But it does mean something to me. It means I get a fat discount on buying more of the business because managers are engaged in forced selling and buying to rebalance portfolios, ETF's, and funds that track these various indices.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

542,stocks,"Wait a second before you have a meltdown over this. Hear me out, then tell me that I'm a dumbass.

It's my belief that most people turn into the Boglehead types over time because of their experiences with paying taxes on short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains. Newer investors don't have the experience with dealing with their taxes as much, so they tend to swing for the fences with shorter-term positions.

More seasoned investors tend to buy and hold, but this is a learned behavior because they know that their absolute worst case tax scenario on a long-term gain is 20 percent (federally). Of course, you only pay the 20 percent on long-term cap gains if you're income is over like 492k or something. Most end up paying about 15 percent federal tax on their long-term cap gains. Short-term cap gains seem to be taxed almost double that amount, obviously it depends on your exact tax bracket situation, but you get the point.

Thus, it's been beaten into the heads of seasoned investors that it's just smarter in the long run to hold positions for at least a year, because your tax bill is often cut in half, or almost in half. You do this long enough, and it becomes ingrained in your investing personality.

All of this makes perfect sense to me.

Ok, now let's talk about Roth IRA's. With Roth IRA's, if you're doing things correctly, there's ZERO taxes on your earnings when you're taking your money out. Obviously you need to be 59 1/2 years old and you need to have passed the 5-year rule, etc., etc.

But if ultimately there's no tax implications whatsoever for investments that are under the Roth umbrella, why do most people tend to hold things for the long-term, and be ultraconservative?

**WAIT!**

I already know what you're going to say, but I'm going to argue that it's nonsensical. You're going to say because Roth IRA's are designed for retirement, and when you get up to that age you should be a lot more risk adverse, because you really need this money for your retirement and you can't be screwing around, taking penitentiary chances.

However, here's my argument to that. Consider all of your investments, Roth and normal brokerages as this large bucket of water. Most ~~people~~ investors will have a Roth account and a regular brokerage account. Due the limitations on how much you can get into a Roth each year, it's likely that most people will have at least 5 to 6 times as much money in their regular brokerage accounts as their Roth accounts. For example.... Imagine somebody has 50k grand total in various Roth accounts. Maybe a standard issue Roth and a 401k Roth. But they have 250k in a ""normal"" brokerage account.

In this scenario, less than 17 percent of their overall investment money is in their Roth. So, the argument that they need to be ULTRA CAREFUL WITH THEIR ROTH MONEY is pretty illogical, because it's such a small percentage of their overall scenario.

**Wouldn't it be tremendously more logical to actually trade that 17 percent of their account more aggressively, when it's the only 17 percent that isn't negatively affected by moving in and out of stocks?**

Think about the guy that has Microsoft stock. Been holding MSFT for years. He knows the ups and downs. The peaks and valleys. He can probably tell you countless times he would have taken profits if only there wasn't a major tax consequence. So, he doesn't take profits when the stock gets ahead of itself, and then buy back in during a retracement. But his reasoning is tax implications. Inside a Roth, there's no tax implications. Thus, this same investor could sell out of MSFT when he thinks it's gotten ahead of itself, and then buy back in during a retracement and end up with more overall shares. All with no taxable implications whatsoever.

Now obviously, nobody can predict the future and sometimes people are going to get it wrong. They'll sell MSFT when they think the stock has gotten way ahead of itself and then it continues to go on a tear and now he can't buy back in and still have the same number of shares.

But by the same token, just talk to any Amazon investor over the last three years. That shit has basically gone pretty much nowhere for a three-year period. So the whole buy and hold forever strategy hasn't worked out that great for AMZN holders. 

It cuts both ways. Don't just cherry pick the example of it hurting.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait a second before you have a meltdown over this. Hear me out, then tell me that I&amp;#39;m a dumbass.&lt;/p&gt;

557,stocks,"Hey, I wanted to share my thoughts on a financial metric: Return On Equity. Return on equity calculation is: *Net income/Shareholders Equity.* **I believe Return on Equity is useful, however it can mislead investors if you do not understand its limits. Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) is better for assessing earning power.**

For example, if company A generates $20,000 in income and has $100,000 in equity, then return on equity is 20%. If company B generates $20,000 in income and has $200,000 in equity, then return on equity is 10%. Based on the above example, Company A is more efficient and requires fewer capital to generate the same profit as Company B.

*However...*

*COMPANY A BALANCE SHEET*

|**Assets**|$1,000,000|
|:-|:-|
|**Liabilities**|$900,000|

For Company A, If we add assets and subtract it by liabilities: Equity is $100,000. However, liabilities represent 90% of total assets (*$900,000/$100,000).* Debt to Equity ratio would be: **9.**

*COMPANY B BALANCE SHEET*

|**Assets**|$300,000|
|:-|:-|
|**Liabilities**|$100,000|

For company B, if we add assets and subtract it by liabilities: Equity is $200,000. However, liabilities only represent 33% of total assets *($100,000/$200,000).* Debt to Equity ratio would be **0.5.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This explains why companies like Caterpillar (42% ROE) appears more profitable than Alphabet (23%). Or Nordstrom (33% ROE) compared with META (18%). ROE is higher for the former two not because they have more earning power, but because they are far more leveraged *(carry more debt).*

**Conclusion:**

Make sure you are checking the health of a company's balance sheet before comparing ROE between two companies in the same industry. This is why I think ROE is overrated and prefer to use ROIC instead.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, I wanted to share my thoughts on a financial metric: Return On Equity.

In that post, I included some very gloomy datapoints about how the UK economy has stagnated relative to its EU / G7 peers. Well, perhaps the gloom was overly stated.

I'll include snippets from the [FT article here](https://www.ft.com/content/50386cc2-003b-4af1-946b-cf3243da810f).

&gt;  Official statistics on Friday **added almost 2 per cent to the size of the UK economy**, in a surprise move that showed the country recovered much faster from the pandemic than previously reported. [...]

&gt; The changes reveal that, by the end of 2021, the country’s economy was **0.6 per cent larger than pre-pandemic levels** — instead of 1.2 per cent smaller, as previously estimated. [...] [And, going to the most recent data in 2023, it is estimated to be 1.6% larger instead of 0.2% smaller]

&gt; In a preview of new national accounts data to be included in official figures from October, the ONS said it had uncovered big sources of growth it had previously not taken account of, particularly as the economy recovered from the pandemic in 2021


&gt; As recently as mid August, official data reflected ONS estimates that the economy had still not reached its pre-pandemic level, even by the second quarter of this year.

 &gt; But, after the revisions are included in official figures in October, they will show that the UK economy recovered from the pandemic in late 2021, **a recovery as strong as France’s and better than Germany’s**.

&gt; That will add the equivalent of **two years of current UK growth** to the country’s gross domestic product. 

There were modifications to the Covid growth plunge:

&gt;  The ONS now says the economic contraction at the height of the Covid crisis in 2020 was not as deep as previously thought. It found that companies had been adding to piles of unsold stocks rather than running them down, as previously thought. 

&gt; That accumulation of stock caused a £14bn upward revision to the level of real gross domestic product for 2022. As a result, **GDP is estimated to have slumped by 10.4 per cent in 2020 rather than 11 per cent**. The fall that year still qualifies as the worst annual contraction since the “great frost” of 1709.

Other mismeasurements found were in health care:

&gt; The ONS also discovered that wholesale companies and the health sector produced much more in 2021 than previously thought.
&gt; 
&gt; The revision was largely due to higher margins as Covid curbs eased, which boosted income, profits and ultimately GDP.
&gt; 
&gt; The ONS update corrects a previous anomaly, in which huge amounts of extra money was being spent in healthcare over the pandemic but measured output did not rise accordingly. This also meant GDP was significantly higher than previously thought.



[Graph 1 of the revisions](https://i.imgur.com/ML374wR.png).

[Graph 2 showing comparisons](https://i.imgur.com/Bvc5goS.png) to other G7 countries. Go to the actual article to hover over the other countries. It's hard to see from the screenshot, but Germany is now the biggest laggard, and ahead of the revised UK is France (barely), Italy, Japan, Canada, and the UK. The UK is now 1.6% higher than pre-pandemic, while the US is up 6.1%, Canada +3.7% (not fully up to date), Japan +3.4%, Italy +2.1%, France +1.7%, and Germany +0.2%.

In my view, this increases my viewpoint that yes, the UK stock market is mispriced. No I don't think there are any shenanigans with the data, simply that measuring the aggregate output of an entire economy is hard.

567,stocks,"I plan on adding a soft drink company to my portfolio, because I don't feel like adding up on my positions, which are quite pricy, nor buying something like the QQQ or any growth fund which would increasingly expose me to tech.

The three choices are obviously Coca Cola, Pespsi and Monster.

Coca cola is the one trading at the lowest multiple, paying the highest dividend, and arguably the one with stronger brand recognition. I really like the fact that they are deleverging and consistently paying off their debt, however the growth has been lagging behind. Has less than half the revenues of Pepsi does (43bln vs 92 bln), but just over twice the net margins. I would say its the safest play.

Pepsi has done I think decent acquistions ( ex, Doctor Pepper ), and is growing slightly faster than Coke with a lower dividend. Very stable growth, a fair amount of debt (nothing too concerning). 

Monster growth has been, well, Monstrous. However the PE is 41 (10 more than pepsi, 16 more than coke), and since they never paid dividend the balance-sheet looks incredible. They have more cash than all liabilities, and are already doing buybacks, which for fast growing company is quite nice,as it means they can already return capital to shareholders while expanding operations, without using debt. I am not saying it is undervalued (PE 41), but given the current multiples and its track record, it doesn't seem too bad. The brand doesn't have the same track record of the other two, but is well known and the managment seems to know how to keep it relevant and in touch with consumers preferences. I don't think its going away (stressed overworked people needs energy drinks haha) but the future might be more uncertain than with the other two.

What are your thoughts on these companies?

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I plan on adding a soft drink company to my portfolio, because I don&amp;#39;t feel like adding up on my positions, which are quite pricy, nor buying something like the QQQ or any growth fund which would increasingly expose me to tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three choices are obviously Coca Cola, Pespsi and Monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca cola is the one trading at the lowest multiple, paying the highest dividend, and arguably the one with stronger brand recognition. I really like the fact that they are deleverging and consistently paying off their debt, however the growth has been lagging behind. Has less than half the revenues of Pepsi does (43bln vs 92 bln), but just over twice the net margins. I would say its the safest play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pepsi has done I think decent acquistions ( ex, Doctor Pepper ), and is growing slightly faster than Coke with a lower dividend. Very stable growth, a fair amount of debt (nothing too concerning). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monster growth has been, well, Monstrous. However the PE is 41 (10 more than pepsi, 16 more than coke), and since they never paid dividend the balance-sheet looks incredible. They have more cash than all liabilities, and are already doing buybacks, which for fast growing company is quite nice,as it means they can already return capital to shareholders while expanding operations, without using debt. I am not saying it is undervalued (PE 41), but given the current multiples and its track record, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem too bad. The brand doesn&amp;#39;t have the same track record of the other two, but is well known and the managment seems to know how to keep it relevant and in touch with consumers preferences. I don&amp;#39;t think its going away (stressed overworked people needs energy drinks haha) but the future might be more uncertain than with the other two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on these companies?&lt;/p&gt;

Cable giant Charter Communications and Disney are in a battle over contract fees that has left millions of people without access to U.S. Open, college football and potentially “Monday Night Football,” with the NFL’s season starting in just days. On Thursday, Disney said that the two companies have been in ongoing negotiations but yet to agree to a new deal. That resulted in Charter’s customers losing access to its networks, including broadcaster ABC and pay-TV channels such as ESPN and FX. Charter and Disney’s stocks were each down more than 2% on Friday. Charter’s Spectrum TV service has roughly 14.7 million customers across 41 states, with some of its top TV markets being New York, Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta.

These sorts of battles, which can lead to so-called blackouts for pay-TV customers, are common in the industry. But, in the age of streaming, this one is different. “This is not a typical carriage dispute,” Charter CEO Chris Winfrey said Friday on a call with investors. Early Friday, Charter executives called the pay-TV ecosystem “broken.” They said they pushed for a revamped deal with Disney that would see Charter cable customers receive access to Disney’s ad-supported streaming services like Disney+ and ESPN+ at no additional cost. This seemed to be the sticking point as Charter said it accepted Disney’s request for higher fees, although Charter executives didn’t provide specifics on the negotiations as they remain hopeful to get a deal done. Winfrey noted that in the last five years the entire pay-TV ecosystem has lost nearly 25 million customers, or almost 25% of total industry customers. “It’s staggering,” he said.

Between the high cost of the traditional bundle and the option to switch to more affordable streaming options – most of which are provided by the same companies behind the networks on pay-TV – the speed at which cord-cutting is only accelerating. Live sports, particularly those shown on ESPN, have long been considered the glue holding the pay-TV bundle together, especially as customers flee for streaming services. The two companies renewed their contract in 2019, which also included Charter integrating Disney+ and ESPN+, as well as Hulu, into its set-top boxes to give customers more seamless access to those apps, CNBC previously reported. Charter, which also provides broadband and mobile services but is not in the content business, has said it values its pay-TV business and wants to see it thrive, even if it takes on a different form than the past.

Disney CEO Bob Iger recently said on CNBC that assessing its traditional TV business is at the top of his list, and opened the door to potentially unloading these assets in a sale. The CEO, who returned to the helm late last year, said he realized the company is facing a lot of challenges, many of which are “self-inflicted.” Iger did note that ESPN is in a different bucket and Disney was instead open to selling a stake in the network while also moving toward a direct-to-consumer streaming service of its live feed.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/01/disney-charter-battle-over-spectrum-blackout.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/01/disney-charter-battle-over-spectrum-blackout.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Matthew Pfau: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to first start on the restatement, and I was just hoping you could better explain to us what happened here from an accounting perspective. It seems a little bit counterintuitive that both inventory and would be overstated while COGS were understated. So what happened that drove that? And then on the cash component, how did that sort of tie out when the accounting was wrong on the other side of the financial statements.

Kevin Buchel: So Matt, the inventory for the quarters that succeeded the June 30, 2022 physical inventory audited statements, the quarters that followed it, which was the September quarter the December quarter and the March quarter of fiscal 2023. The inventory was valued using values from the 6/30/22 audited numbers. What that means is take as an example, if a component was valued at $50 at June 30, 2022. That same $50 was used to value the inventory for the first quarter, and let’s say, the second quarter and let’s say, the third quarter. The cost of that component was coming down, no longer $50, $5 using this one example. You value the inventory at $50, you’re overstating your inventory when you put a valuation on your balance sheet.

If you’re overstating your inventory and your balance sheet, that means the other side of the equation is you’re understating your cost of goods sold. It has nothing to do with cash. This is all book entries Cash is unaffected. Cash flow unaffected cash from ops, none of that is affected. This is strictly overstated your inventory – it means you understated your cost of goods sold. If you understated, your cost of goods sold, that means you overstated your net income. And that’s what it is now. we’re going to fix this, and we’ve begun the process of fixing it. You can’t use the prior year’s physical inventory valuation going forward. normal conditions, it could use it, but in fluctuating pricing times and who knows what the times are going to be going forward times seem to be better now, the fluctuations seem to be gone.

But we’re going to have a system where we measure every fluctuation during the quarters and we utilize that new price if there is a new price to value the inventory in each quarter. We’ll do it at the beginning the first day after the quarter end, so on October 1, let’s say, for the upcoming end of the quarter, we’ll measure every fluctuation that exists up or down and we’ll make sure that the inventory valuation for the quarter utilizes the correct price. And that’s the best way I could explain it, Matt. It’s nothing to do with cash for those that took accounting in school, it’s – you’ve got to credit your inventory, lower your inventory, you’ve got to debit your cost of goods sold, and that reduces profits. That’s what it was.

Matthew Pfau: Got it. And then with the stock down significantly from the highs, are you considering repurchasing any stock or is management team considering any personal purchases themselves?

Kevin Buchel: That’s all on the table. And it’s possible we will do that. The first things first, let’s get the Qs, the restated Qs filed. We expect to do that this week. Let’s get the K filed. We expect to do that next week. And then we could look at buybacks and personal buying all this it’s all on the table. Let’s get this – our house in order with our filings and we go from there.

592,stocks,"# INTRODUCTION:

MTCH the parent company for a large number of successful dating apps e.g. Tinder, Hinge and OkCupid, their growth has grinded to a halt recently with a very unique business model where the more successful/effective their product is the more subscribers they lose. Management has laid out several game plans such as increasing marketing spend, releasing higher priced tier e.g. HingeX and Price &amp; Margin Optimization through removing introduction &amp; discount pricing.   


# REVENUE:

The largest difficulty I faced when forecasting subscribers for MTCH is their unique business model. However, good dating apps are able to grow faster than their subscribers churn as the word of mouth advertisement and successful couples being a walking billboard for them are all a crucial part of the business model of MTCH. So, when creating a revenue model I was under the assumption that the churn isn’t to a significant amount. I believe it's much less accurate to try and forecast churn into my “older” subscribers and project from there as I’d be making far bolder assumptions than simply assuming subscribers grow at a faster pace than churn.  
  
The direction for revenue that management is taking is “longer term…We'll essentially have fewer payers but at higher price points.” - 2022 Q4 Earnings Conference.  
  
Factors affecting the growth rate of revenue/payers and amount of payers is “Prevalence of smartphones in the market” and “affluence of the market”. ([SOURCE](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/App-makers-cash-in-as-Southeast-Asia-falls-for-mobile-dating))   
APAC Payers growth is very dependent on consumers getting smartphones or pivoting from traditional methods of dating e.g. Matchmaker or arranged marriage, which is especially prevalent in India ([SOURCE](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59530706)). So due to the difference in consumption patterns, I’ll forecast America and Europe with similar trends. Whereas APAC and others follow a separate trend.   
But for all regions I'll assume that they follow historic trends of either meager increase or decline for the next 2 years as macro trends continue for the next 2 years, before improving for the better as macro conditions improve.  
  
For America and Europe,  
  
To forecast Y/Y payers,   
As the macro environment changes for the better, America and Europe Y/Y payers will get a slight increase in growth at similar levels as 2021 where economic conditions were the most favorable for the next 3 years before tapering off for the rest of my forecast.  
  
To forecast Y/Y revenue/payers,   
I assume that revenue/payers will get a bump as MTCH better optimize their prices either through a higher paid tier or better pricing/less discounts. Which is a direction management wants to take as stated on their Q4 2022 Earnings Conference.  
  
For APAC and Others,  
  
I believe the explosive growth historically will not sustain as this explosive growth is a low hanging fruit, mainly people who are curious and the most willing to try dating apps. It’ll take about 6 years for MTCH’s products to catch on as consumers will require a cultural shift and overcome the difficulties as stated above facing this region. So from then on, MTCH could start charging a higher price.   
  
For Indirect Revenue, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of subscription revenue as the success of indirect revenue comes from how well subscription does.  
  
REVENUE MODEL: \[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/JIFQay0)\]  


# COST:

COGS comes from e.g. Customer care, hosting fees &amp; in-app purchase fees etc. Given that MTCH's cash cows e.g. tinder and hinge are mainly on the app store, this means that the largest COGS should be in app processing fees. Opting for less granularity, I’ll assume that COGS will tend towards 30% of Revenue as the app store collects 30% from the sale of in app purchases.   
  
***Marketing,***  
Management has stated their intent to increase marketing spend, I’ll assume that they have elevated marketing spend for the next 2 years. Remaining at historic levels for the next 5 years before tapering down. Management does not need to go overboard with marketing spend given that the business model of dating apps is that they spread mainly through word of mouth.  
  
***G&amp;A,***  
Management has stated that they have overhired and would like to optimize margins. I'd assume G&amp;A spend remains at a constant nominal amount for the next 2 years before the economy picks up again and the demand for dating apps rises which allows MTCH to hire more people for the next 3 years before tapering down.  
  
***R&amp;D,***  
I’ll assume that R&amp;D expenditure follows historic trends to avoid being overly granular.  
  
COST MODEL: \[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/m9Db92K)\]  


# CAPEX and D&amp;A:

I’ll assume that the company gets more capital efficient for the next 2 years, reinvesting below or near historic amounts. Before expanding its Earnings Reinvested for the next 3 years to accommodate the higher growth and tapering into capital neutral.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately at base case I value MTCH at $56.94. I don’t necessarily agree with management’s plans moving forward on how they plan on growing through higher marketing spend. A good dating app should mainly grow through word of mouth as it shows that churned users are satisfied with the services provided and are living proof of the effectiveness of the app. I do see higher priced tier being a viable solution especially with users who are impatient or need a bump, but the removal of introductory pricing may cause an issue as a dating app may not be worth spending a lot of money on till users can see its worth proven either through word of mouth or trying their services at a low initial commitment.

&lt;p&gt;As the macro environment changes for the better, America and Europe Y/Y payers will get a slight increase in growth at similar levels as 2021 where economic conditions were the most favorable for the next 3 years before tapering off for the rest of my forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To forecast Y/Y revenue/payers, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume that revenue/payers will get a bump as MTCH better optimize their prices either through a higher paid tier or better pricing/less discounts. Which is a direction management wants to take as stated on their Q4 2022 Earnings Conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For APAC and Others,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the explosive growth historically will not sustain as this explosive growth is a low hanging fruit, mainly people who are curious and the most willing to try dating apps. It’ll take about 6 years for MTCH’s products to catch on as consumers will require a cultural shift and overcome the difficulties as stated above facing this region. So from then on, MTCH could start charging a higher price.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Indirect Revenue, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of subscription revenue as the success of indirect revenue comes from how well subscription does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REVENUE MODEL: [&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/JIFQay0""&gt;INSERT&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COST:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COGS comes from e.g. Customer care, hosting fees &amp;amp; in-app purchase fees etc. Given that MTCH&amp;#39;s cash cows e.g. tinder and hinge are mainly on the app store, this means that the largest COGS should be in app processing fees. Opting for less granularity, I’ll assume that COGS will tend towards 30% of Revenue as the app store collects 30% from the sale of in app purchases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marketing,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management has stated their intent to increase marketing spend, I’ll assume that they have elevated marketing spend for the next 2 years. Remaining at historic levels for the next 5 years before tapering down. Management does not need to go overboard with marketing spend given that the business model of dating apps is that they spread mainly through word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;G&amp;amp;A,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management has stated that they have overhired and would like to optimize margins. I&amp;#39;d assume G&amp;amp;A spend remains at a constant nominal amount for the next 2 years before the economy picks up again and the demand for dating apps rises which allows MTCH to hire more people for the next 3 years before tapering down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;R&amp;amp;D,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll assume that R&amp;amp;D expenditure follows historic trends to avoid being overly granular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COST MODEL: [&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/m9Db92K""&gt;INSERT&lt;/a&gt;]  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAPEX and D&amp;amp;A:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll assume that the company gets more capital efficient for the next 2 years, reinvesting below or near historic amounts. Before expanding its Earnings Reinvested for the next 3 years to accommodate the higher growth and tapering into capital neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASSUMPTIONS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;WACC remains constant at 11.57%, TGR is at 2.0%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change in NWC follows historic trends as shown in this schedule [&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/LfLhTzI""&gt;INSERT&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Churn is not a significant factor that affects growth rate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WACC:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;COST OF EQUITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFR (1M Avg) = 3.82%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market Beta (&lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MTCH/""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;) = 1.59&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings Yield (1M Avg) = 3.98%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 (1M Avg) = $4467.72&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth Forecast (&lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/credit-suisse-ups-sp-500-year-end-forecast-4700-2023-07-18/#:%7E:text=The%20S%26P%20500%20is%20currently,company%20earnings%20and%20to%20buybacks""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4050 = (4700 x 3.98%) / (1+R) + (4700 x (1+7%)) x 3.98% / (1+R)^2 + (5029 x 3.98%) x (1 + 2%) / (R - 2%) / (1+R)^3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R = 9.12% &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ERP = 5.30%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COE = 12.25%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;COST OF DEBT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BB bond yield (1M Avg) = 7%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marginal Tax Rate = 21%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AT-COD = 5.53%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WEIGHTAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll assume that FY22 interest expense carries until the maturity of the relevant debt and remove the consideration of that debt from interest expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FY22 interest expense = 146M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MV Long Term Debt = 1313.32M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lease Liability = 111.91M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Liability = 1425.23M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avg Price (1M Avg) = $45.65&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares O/S = 279.32M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market Value of Equity = 12750.96M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;%Equity = 89.9%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;%Liability = 10.1%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WACC = 11.57%  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SANITY CHECK:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at %Earnings Reinvested, Growth Rate and ROIC. I forecasted even below historic averages to be as conservative as possible   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/srRM7mi""&gt;INSERT&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately at base case I value MTCH at $56.94. I don’t necessarily agree with management’s plans moving forward on how they plan on growing through higher marketing spend. A good dating app should mainly grow through word of mouth as it shows that churned users are satisfied with the services provided and are living proof of the effectiveness of the app. I do see higher priced tier being a viable solution especially with users who are impatient or need a bump, but the removal of introductory pricing may cause an issue as a dating app may not be worth spending a lot of money on till users can see its worth proven either through word of mouth or trying their services at a low initial commitment.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worst Case: [&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Cr3niM2""&gt;INSERT&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is officially recommending that marijuana be moved from Schedule I to Schedule III under federal law—a historic development that means the top health agency no longer considers cannabis to be a drug with high abuse potential and no medical value.  
&gt;  
&gt;After completing a scientific review into cannabis under a directive from President Joe Biden last year, HHS is now telling the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that it believes marijuana should be placed in Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The recommendation is not binding, and DEA has the final say, but the scientific analysis combined with growing political support for cannabis reform may well influence DEA to make the change.

Nearly one year ago (October 2022), Biden tasked the AG and HHS to review cannabis' schedule on the controlled substances act. It has been long speculated that the intention of the Biden administration has been to reschedule cannabis shortly before the 2024 election. Over the past few months, rumors emerged that the federal government is targeting schedule 3 for cannabis. Today, we received confirmation of that intention as well as seeing another domino fall in the process to remove cannabis from schedule 1 status with the HHS officially recommending its move to schedule 3.

Today's action is the most significant move on the federal level for cannabis reform since cannabis became schedule 1 back in 1970. The ball is now in the DEA's court. They typically respond to these review requests in \~3 months, and rely on the scientific and medical research of federal agencies such as HHS for their decision making. This would set us up to see cannabis likely rescheduled in Q1 of 2024, lining up nicely with the election.

This would have tremendous impact on the US cannabis companies which currently face regulatory hurdles that are unheard of in other sectors. These companies are paying 70-80% tax rates as they are unable to deduct normal business expenses due to 280E, which only applies to schedule 1 and 2 substances. Schedule 3 would eliminate this tax burden and make many of these companies profitable overnight. It would also remove hurdles in terms of access to the federal banking system and would ultimately allow these companies to uplist to the major US exchanges such as the NASDAQ and NYSE. Currently these stocks trade on the CSE, a small Canadian stock exchange that is heavily manipulated and illiquid.

On Friday August 25th, [Elon Musk posted a video on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1695247110030119054?s=46&amp;t=0YLBKtmQe8-F_nJ00NQvxg), that now has 44 million views, of him driving a Tesla on autopilot. In the video he has to brake the car himself when it almost runs a red light (at around 19:45). It also received a decent amount of news coverage. 

This appears to have not affected the stock’s value at all and as of the closing today (August 29th) the stock is up over 7%

I’d expect such an incident to have negative effects on a company’s value, but this didn’t. 

Are these sorts of things usually just not big deals? 

If Apple were demonstrating their new iPhone’s amazing app that works perfectly and then it caused the phone to crash, would that negatively affect the value?

Or is it basically all just about the money that the company brings in?

—— 

Thanks to everybody who answered nicely. I’ve gotten some explanations that make sense including:

- Elon’s livestream video wasn’t of current autopilot software on Teslas, but rather a beta FSD which performed very well. 
- 44 million people probably didn’t actually see that moment where “human intervention” takes place. Plus the media blew it out of proportion. 
- Computer trading algorithms don’t care about these minute things. 
- This isn’t exclusive to Tesla. Similar things like this happening to other gigantic companies happen and they barely matter. 
- The market overall went up on the 29th and Tesla has a high beta.

&lt;p&gt;On Friday August 25th, &lt;a href=""https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1695247110030119054?s=46&amp;amp;t=0YLBKtmQe8-F_nJ00NQvxg""&gt;Elon Musk posted a video on X&lt;/a&gt;, that now has 44 million views, of him driving a Tesla on autopilot. In the video he has to brake the car himself when it almost runs a red light (at around 19:45). It also received a decent amount of news coverage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This appears to have not affected the stock’s value at all and as of the closing today (August 29th) the stock is up over 7%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d expect such an incident to have negative effects on a company’s value, but this didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are these sorts of things usually just not big deals? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Apple were demonstrating their new iPhone’s amazing app that works perfectly and then it caused the phone to crash, would that negatively affect the value?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is it basically all just about the money that the company brings in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—— &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everybody who answered nicely. I’ve gotten some explanations that make sense including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elon’s livestream video wasn’t of current autopilot software on Teslas, but rather a beta FSD which performed very well. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;44 million people probably didn’t actually see that moment where “human intervention” takes place. Plus the media blew it out of proportion. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer trading algorithms don’t care about these minute things. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This isn’t exclusive to Tesla. Similar things like this happening to other gigantic companies happen and they barely matter. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market overall went up on the 29th and Tesla has a high beta. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry that my post was so offensive towards Tesla and the Saviour.&lt;/p&gt;

614,stocks,"The world could face a shortage for lithium as demand for the metal ramps up, with some analysts forecasting that it could come as soon as 2025. Others, however, see a longer time frame before that shortfall hits.

BMI, a Fitch Solutions research unit, was among those that predict a lithium supply deficit by 2025. In a recently published report, BMI largely attributed the deficit to China’s lithium demand exceeding that of its supply.

“We expect an average of 20.4% year-on-year annual growth for China’s lithium demand for EVs alone over 2023-2032,” the report stated. 

In contrast, China’s lithium supply will only grow 6% over the same period, BMI said, adding that rate cannot satiate even one third of forecasted demand. 

China is the world’s third largest producer of lithium, which is an integral element in electric vehicle batteries. 

The world produced 540,000 metric tons of lithium in 2021, and by 2030 the World Economic Forum projects that global demand will reach over 3 million metric tons.

I want to start regularly buying IRA stock. I'll just follow the market, so S&amp;P 500 sounds good. But I found out I could buy triple leveraged S&amp;P 500.

&amp;#x200B;

According to google, since UPRO's (triple leveraged S&amp;P 500) inception in June 2009 it's increased 3,592%. Currently, E/R of .91%.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

&gt;*Germany Is Losing Its Mojo. Finding It Again Won’t Be Easy.*

&gt;*BERLIN—Two decades ago, Germany revived its moribund economy and became a manufacturing powerhouse of an era of globalization.*

&gt;*Times changed. Germany didn’t keep up. Now Europe’s biggest economy has to reinvent itself again. But its fractured political class is struggling to find answers to a dizzying conjunction of long-term headaches and short-term crises, leading to a growing sense of malaise.*

&gt;*Germany will be the world’s only major economy to contract in 2023, with even sanctioned Russia experiencing growth, according to the International Monetary Fund.*

Germany’s reliance on manufacturing and world trade has made it particularly vulnerable to recent global turbulence: supply-chain disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic, surging energy prices after Russia invaded Ukraine, and the rise in inflation and interest rates that have led to a global slowdown.

At Germany’s biggest carmaker Volkswagen, top executives shared a dire assessment on an internal conference call in July, according to people familiar with the event. Exploding costs, falling demand and new rivals such as Tesla and Chinese electric-car makers are making for a “perfect storm,” a divisional chief told his colleagues, adding: “The roof is on fire.”

The problems aren’t new. Germany’s manufacturing output and its gross domestic product have stagnated since 2018, suggesting that its long-successful model has lost its mojo.

China was for years a major driver of Germany’s export boom. A rapidly industrializing China bought up all the capital goods that Germany could make. But China’s investment-heavy growth model has been approaching its limits for years. Growth and demand for imports have faltered.

Instead of Germany’s best customers, Chinese industries have become aggressive competitors. Upstart Chinese carmakers are competing with German incumbents such as VW that are lagging in the electric-vehicle revolution.

More broadly, the world has become less favorable to the kind of open trade that benefited Germany. The shift was expressed most clearly in then-President Donald Trump imposing tariffs not only on imports from China but also those of U.S. allies in Europe. The U.K.’s 2016 decision to leave the European Union and Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, leading to EU sanctions, also signaled a shift toward a more hostile environment for big exporters.

Germany’s long industrial boom led to complacency about its domestic weaknesses, from an aging labor force to sclerotic services sectors and mounting bureaucracy. The country was doing better at supporting old industries such as cars, machinery and chemicals than at fostering new ones, such as digital technology. Germany’s only major software company, SAP, was founded in 1975.

Years of skimping on public investment have led to fraying infrastructure, an increasingly mediocre education system and poor high-speed internet and mobile-phone connectivity compared with other advanced economies.

Germany’s once-efficient trains have become a byword for lateness. The public administration’s continued reliance on fax machines became a national joke. Even the national soccer teams are being routinely beaten.

“We’ve kind of slept through a decade or so of challenges,” said Moritz Schularick, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

In March, one of Germany’s most storied companies, multinational industrial-gas group Linde, delisted from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in favor of maintaining a sole listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The decision was driven in part by the growing burden of financial regulation in Germany. But also, Linde, whose roots go back to 1879, said it no longer wanted to be perceived just as German—an association that it believed was depressing its appeal to investors.

Germany today is in the midst of another cycle of success, stagnation and pressure for reforms, said Josef Joffe, a longtime newspaper publisher and a fellow at Stanford University.

“Germany will bounce back, but it suffers from two longer-term ailments: above all its failure to transform an old-industry system into a knowledge economy, and an irrational energy policy,” Joffe said.

“I think it’s important to remember that Germany is still a global leader,” German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said in an interview. “We’re the world’s fourth-largest economy. We have the economic know-how and I’m proud of our skilled workforce. But at the moment, we are not as competitive as we could be,” he said.

Germany still has many strengths. Its deep reservoir of technical and engineering know-how and its specialty in capital goods still put it in a position to profit from future growth in many emerging economies. Its labor-market reforms have greatly improved the share of the population that has a job. The national debt is lower than that of most of its peers and financial markets view its bonds as among the world’s safest assets.

The country’s challenges now are less severe than they were in the 1990s, after German reunification, said Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg Bank in Hamburg.

Back then, Germany was struggling with the massive costs of integrating the former Communist east. Rising global competition and rigid labor laws were contributing to high unemployment. Spending on social benefits ballooned. Too many people depended on welfare, while too few workers paid for it. German reliance on manufacturing was seen as old-fashioned at a time when other countries were betting on e-commerce and financial services.

After a period of national angst, then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder pared back welfare entitlements, deregulated parts of the labor market and pressured the unemployed to take available jobs. The controversial reforms split Schröder’s Social Democrats, and he fell from power.

Private-sector changes were as important as government measures. German companies cooperated with employees to make working practices more flexible. Unions agreed to forgo pay raises in return for keeping factories and jobs in Germany.

Germany Inc. grew leaner. Meanwhile, the world was demanding more of what Germans were good at making, including capital goods and luxury cars.

China’s sweeping investments in industrial capacity powered the sales of machine-tool makers in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. VW invested heavily in China, tapping newly affluent consumers’ appetite for German cars.

Schröder’s successor, longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel, presided over years of growth with little pressure for further unpopular overhauls. Booming exports to developing countries helped Germany bounce back from the 2008 global financial crisis better than many other Western countries.

Complacency crept in. Service sectors, which made up the bulk of gross domestic product and jobs, were less dynamic than export-oriented manufacturers. Wage restraint sapped consumer demand. German companies saved rather than invested much of their profits.

Successful exporters became reluctant to change. German suppliers of automotive components were so confident of their strength that many dismissed warnings that electric vehicles would soon challenge the internal combustion engine. After failing to invest in batteries and other technology for new-generation cars, many now find themselves overtaken by Chinese upstarts.

A recent study by PwC found that German auto suppliers, partly through reluctance to change, have suffered a loss of global market share since 2019 as big as their gains in the previous two decades.

More German businesses are complaining of the growing density of red tape.

BioNTech, a lauded biotech firm that developed the Covid-19 vaccine produced in partnership with Pfizer, recently decided to move some research and clinical-trial activities to the U.K. because of Germany’s restrictive rules on data protection.

German privacy laws made it impossible to run key studies for cancer cures, BioNTech’s co-founder Ugur Sahin said recently. German approvals processes for new treatments, which were accelerated during the pandemic, have reverted to their sluggish pace, he said.

Germany ought to be among the nations winning from advances in medical science, said Hans Georg Näder, chairman of Ottobock, a leading maker of high-tech artificial limbs. Instead, operating in Germany is getting evermore difficult thanks to new regulations, he said.

One recent law required all German manufacturers to vouch for the environment, legal and ethical credentials of every component’s supplier, requiring even smaller companies to perform due diligence on many foreign firms, often based overseas, such as in China.

Näder said his company must now scrutinize thousands of business partners, from software developers to makers of tiny metal screws, to comply with regulation. Ottobock decided to open its latest factory in Bulgaria instead of Germany.

Energy costs are posing an existential challenge to sectors such as chemicals. Russia’s war on Ukraine has exposed Germany’s costly bet on Russian gas to help fill a gap left by the decision to shut down nuclear power plants.

German politicians dismissed warnings that Russian President Vladimir Putin used gas for geopolitical leverage, saying Moscow had always been a reliable supplier. After Putin invaded Ukraine, he throttled gas deliveries to Germany in an attempt to deter European support for Kyiv.

Energy prices in Europe have declined from last year’s peak as EU countries scrambled to replace Russian gas, but German industry still faces higher costs than competitors in the U.S. and Asia.

German executives’ other complaints include a lack of skilled workers, complex immigration rules that make it hard to bring qualified workers from abroad and spotty telecommunications and digital infrastructure.

“Our home market fills us with more and more concern,” Martin Brudermüller, chief executive of chemicals giant BASF, said at his annual shareholders’ meeting in April. “Profitability is no longer anywhere near where it should be,” he said.

One problem Germany can’t fix quickly is demographics. A shrinking labor force has left an estimated two million jobs unfilled. Some 43% of German businesses are struggling to find workers, with the average time for hiring someone approaching six months.

Germany’s fragmented political landscape makes it harder to enact far-reaching changes like the country did 20 years ago. In common with much of Europe, established center-right and center-left parties have lost their electoral dominance. The number of parties in Germany’s parliament has risen steadily.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his Social Democrats lead an unwieldy governing coalition whose members often have diametrically opposed views on the way forward. The Free Democrats want to cut taxes, while the Greens would like to raise them. Left-leaning ministers want to greatly raise public investment spending, financed by borrowing if needed, but finance chief Lindner rejects that. “We need fiscal prudence,” Lindner said.

Senior government members accept the need to cut red tape, as well as for an overhaul of Germany’s energy supply and infrastructure. But party differences often hold up even modest changes. This month the Greens lifted a veto of Lindner’s proposal to reduce business taxes only after they extracted consent for more welfare spending. As part of the deal, the government agreed to pass another law drafted by one of Lindner’s allies, Justice Minister Marco Buschmann, to trim regulation for businesses.

Scholz recently rejected gloomy predictions about Germany. Changes are needed but not a fundamental overhaul of the export-led model that has served Germany well throughout the post-World War II era, he said in an interview on national TV recently.

He cited the inflow of foreign investment into the microchips sector by companies such as Intel, helped by generous government subsidies. Scholz said planned changes to immigration rules, including making it easier to qualify for German citizenship, would help attract more skilled workers.

But Scholz has struggled to stop the infighting in his coalition. The government’s approval ratings have tanked, and the far-right populist Alternative for Germany party has overtaken Scholz’s Social Democrats in opinion polls.

“The country is being led by a bunch of Keystone Kops, a motley coalition that can’t get its act together,” Joffe said.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/germany-is-losing-its-mojo-finding-it-again-wont-be-easy-c4b46761""&gt;https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/germany-is-losing-its-mojo-finding-it-again-wont-be-easy-c4b46761&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

627,stocks,"China Evergrande Group lost $2.2 billion, or 79% of its market value, on Monday after its shares resumed trading in a crucial step for the world's most indebted property firm to restructure its offshore debt.

Evergrande is at the centre of a crisis in China's property sector that has seen a string of debt defaults since late 2021, and its stock has been suspended for 17 months.

The developer, which is in the process of getting approvals from creditors and the courts to implement the debt restructuring plan, said on Monday it would postpone by a month meetings for these creditors to vote on the proposal to give more time ""to maximise creditor engagement and support informed-decision making"".

The scheme meetings will now take place on Sept 26, instead of Monday, but three people with direct knowledge of the matter said many creditors had already registered their vote by a deadline last Wednesday to submit forms.

Evergrande needs approval from more than 75% of the holders of each debt class to approve the plan, which offers creditors with a basket of options to swap debt for new bonds and equity-linked instruments backed by its stocks and those of its Hong Kong-listed units.

Its Hong Kong listed shares closed down 79% to HK$0.35 on Monday. Market capitalisation shrank to HK$4.6 billion ($586.29 million) from HK$21.8 billion ($2.78 billion) from when it last traded.

Additionally, if you're in the camp of ""Only buy US stocks"" don't feel like you need to read the following heresy. At the bottom of this comment I give definitions of the various UK / European indices of relevance. 

First, as I [have written here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/10izb7y/an_update_to_eurous_macro_situation_ft_eurozone/), the macro situation in the UK has been a major disappointment compared to its G7 colleagues. [I put together this album in January](https://imgur.com/a/0KiUXQC) (12 graphs) making this case. Thus, it isn't unexpected that its stock market naturally trails the US/Europe. Up to a point.

The FT had a [recent article](https://www.ft.com/content/726a6188-f04c-40e4-b7d1-a055d75e772c) about the UK's stock market. Some of the graphs and statistics are striking.

- Graph 1: [A decade of sadness for the FTSE 100 versus the S&amp;P 500](https://i.imgur.com/8O6C8ea.png).
- Graph 2: If not bad enough, [here are UK indices versus the rest of the world](https://i.imgur.com/hX4LgRV.png). 

The resulting valuation gap is remarkable:

&gt;  On one crude indicator, price/earnings, FTSE 350 stocks were virtually equally valued to global shares on the eve of the referendum, with both at 18.6 according to Bloomberg data. Now they’re about half the price: as of last Thursday, the FTSE 350 had a price/earnings ratio of 10, while MSCI’s World Index stood at 19.8.

- Graph 3: [PE Ratios for the FTSE 350 vs. Europe (w/ UK included) and the S&amp;P 500.](https://i.imgur.com/NSBxMpE.png).

How extreme are these P/E ratios? According to [Yardeni Research](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/mscipe.pdf), here are some forward P/Es for other countries/region as of last week:

- Japan: 14.3
- US: 19.1
- European Monetary Union (EMU): 11.9 (so countries in the euro-zone, no UK)
- Emerging Markets: 11.9
- World: 16.0
- ACW ex-US 12.6
- Germany: 10.6
- France: 12.9
- Spain: 9.9

And the UK: 10.2.

Maybe Germany/France are also too cheap here. But I'll focus on the UK. Right now emerging markets are more expensive on a forward P/E ratio than the UK. It doesn't add up. Perhaps you think the UK's governance is a disaster. Then sure, avoid domestic UK companies (FTSE 250/FTSE 350). But the FTSE 100 is largely multinationals who derive most of their revenue abroad. Should it really be getting a 10 P/E ratio? In theory, the UK has a ton of advantages: strong property rights, world class universities, and life science research, and some of the oldest financial institutions. Brexit was a self-inflicted wound but there are emerging market countries with much worse governance equipped with richer valuations.

633,stocks,"China lowered the stamp duty on stock trades for the first time since 2008 and pledged to slow the pace of initial public offerings, among a slew of new measures to woo investors back to its flagging equities market.

The levy charged on stock trades will drop from 0.1% to 0.05% as of Aug. 28, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement Sunday, in a move to “invigorate capital markets and boost investor confidence.”

The China Securities Regulatory Commission cited “recent market conditions” as its rationale for slowing the pace of IPOs, without giving details on how it would do so. The CSRC also said restrictions will be set on the frequency and size of refinancing for companies which continuously report financial losses and whose stock prices have fallen below IPO levels or net asset levels. Property developers are exempted from the rule, it said.

Authorities have been trying to dispel worries about the economy triggered by a slumping property market, trust defaults and weak consumer spending. Foreign investors sold mainland China stocks on a net basis for 13 consecutive sessions through Wednesday, the longest stretch ever, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

“Stamp duty cut alone won’t make a difference to the Chinese stocks,” said Neo Wang, Evercore ISI’s New York-based managing director for China Research. “We expect a rally this week, maybe to a less degree than those after China lowered stamp duty in 2008.”

China last cut the stamp duty in April 2008, reducing it to 0.1% to support the market after a plunge, spurring a bull run the following year. The year prior, in May 2007, it raised the rate to 0.3% to cool a rally that was drawing more than 300,000 new investors a day.

Wang added that a turnaround in the A-share market would not happen unless Beijing adopts more “bazooka” measures, such as the 4 trillion yuan stimulus package it rolled out in 2008.

The CSI 300 Index has declined about 4% in 2023 after back-to-back annual losses and is underperforming a broader gauge of Asian equities by about six percentage points. Authorities this month urged pension funds, large banks and other big domestic financial institutions to increase stock investments to support the market.

Regulators have also cut handling fees on stock transactions, prodded mutual fund managers to increase purchases of their own equity funds and encouraged companies to do more share buybacks.

Other highlights of the measures announced by CSRC on Sunday:

    Margin ratio for margin trading is lowered to 80% from 100%, effective from market closing on Sept. 8
        Adjustment will apply to both new and existing contracts of margin trading
    For companies with stock prices fallen below IPO levels or net asset levels, or which haven’t paid cash dividends or which are paying a total cash dividend lower than 30% of average net profit of the recent three years, the controlling share holders and de facto controlling holders will not be allowed to cut holdings in the secondary market

SNAP didn't really have a good way to put ads. They made deals with some companies so they could put ads.

636,stocks,"Live adaptation of One Piece is coming to Netflix on August 31st. For those who don't know, One Piece is the best-selling Japanese manga (comics) series. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, where he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as the ""One Piece"" in order to become the next King of the Pirates. Here's why I think it will *probably* be a big deal:

* One Piece is the second most sold comic book in the world. The first one is Superman with roughly 600m copies sold, One Piece is second with 516.5m, Batman is third with 484m. Also, to give some perspective, One Piece is being sold in copies of \~200 pages, that's 5 to 10 times the size of Batman or Superman comics, and unlike those two it was going for only \~25 years, not 100+ years. So realistically it's already far far ahead of everything else.
* To add some numbers, One Piece has 1000+ manga chapters, 1000+ anime episodes, 15+ movies, 40+ video games and a Disneyland-like theme park.
* This time Netflix won't repeat the Witcher's mistake. The showrunners has shown great respect to the source material. Everyone from the cast are big fans of the manga. One Piece's author has spent a lot of time on overseeing the production.
* The rumors say that Netflix went big here and spent \~$18m on each episode of the adaptation. In comparison, the cost of Game of Thrones season 1 was around $5-6m per episode.
* There are some early reviews already. Everyone is overwhelmingly positive and claims it's the best live adaptation of anime/manga ever. To be fair, I'd be still cautious here since the bar is rather low - all previous adaptations were rather bad, so there is still no guarantee that the series will be on par with regular, non adaptation series.
* Back to #1, One Piece is more popular than Batman, and yet it's less known. Probably every person in the world knows Batman. And most likely every second person reading this post has never heard about One Piece. That's what the live series might change, it will open an already winning IP to an even wider audience.

It seems that the setup is great for the show's success. So, in my opinion, there is a fair chance that Netflix will push One Piece to eventually overstep IPs like Harry Potter/Batman/etc. What do you think, how can Netflix's stock price react to that potential? I feel that due to this weird nature of One Piece being the most popular but yet fairly unknown series, it's completely overlooked and not priced in.

These price increases come on top of those for Hulu and Disney+ Premium (ad-free) that will increase by 20% and 30%, respectively, starting in October 2023. While these initiatives may accelerate the company's top and bottom-line growth, it is still unclear whether they will be able to increase Disney+'s dwindling US streaming market share to 13% by Q2 of 23.   
Long-term, the well-diversified entertainment options provided by DIS, including ESPN and sports betting, across resorts, theme parks, cruises, and streaming, might be a real franchise flywheel.

Although the headset won't be available until early 2024, the media company will probably benefit from its strong IP portfolio and increasingly varied revenue prospects.   
Netflix, unlike Disney, has not yet increased pricing, but it has also subtly discontinued the cheapest ad-free package, thereby increasing overall subscription and advertisement profits. Since more customers are likely to switch to ad-supported rates as a result of less discretionary spending, an elevated interest rate environment, and increased ad-free streaming plans, these moves are undoubtedly deliberate.  
However, Disney investors should also be aware of Disney+'s diminishing streaming market share in the US, which will drop to 13% by Q2 23 (a 5% decrease from December 2022 and a 2% YoY increase). The increased prices could likely result in more churn and market share losses, increasing the stock's volatility during the ensuing two quarters.

&lt;p&gt;However, Disney investors should also be aware of Disney+&amp;#39;s diminishing streaming market share in the US, which will drop to 13% by Q2 23 (a 5% decrease from December 2022 and a 2% YoY increase). The increased prices could likely result in more churn and market share losses, increasing the stock&amp;#39;s volatility during the ensuing two quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

It's common to see people say the S&amp;P 500 returns 8% or 10% or X% annually. In many conversations it's meant to be a rough estimate, which is fine, but many newer investors just pencil it in. 
 
The problem is there are multiple ways to calculate an average.
 
The numbers thrown around when calculating the average return of the index are often the *simple average*. This is the wrong average for investing. 
 
A simple annual average takes all the returns for each year in a period and divides by the number of years in the period. But this is meaningless. 
 
If you bought a stock that returned 100% in the first year and then lost 50% in the second year, then your simple average return in two years is 25%. In reality, you're return is 0% (it doubled, then halved, and now you're back where you started). It's easy to see this with such a ""simple"" example, but the same is true over longer periods of time with less perfect numbers. 
 
For investors, the *geometric average* is what's important. This is what compound annual growth rates (CAGR) reflect. 
 
For example, in the last 25 years (1998 to 2022) the S&amp;P 500 has a simple average annual return of 9.2% and a geometric average annual return of 6.9%. That's a meaningful difference when planning for retirement many years away.
 
And if you account for inflation, then the real geometric average annual return is ""only"" 3.8% in that span (still likely your best option among investments).

He confirmed we could do that and said this was basically free money.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I just don&amp;#39;t really see the benefit of buybacks unless there aren&amp;#39;t any better opportunities. Not at these prices anyway. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

660,stocks,"Overall, my portfolio has been looking great over the past year- but I still have a few stinkers. Some make sense to me, but others leave me thinking there's something else coming or something that I'm not understanding. A few examples-

UBER vs LYFT. I own both but kind of wishing I didn't. They've both been discussed a lot here and on other subs and I think a lot of the sentiment surrounding Lyft has to do with their own personal experience with Lyft and how it's either been slower or more expensive, etc. You obviously can't understate the importance that food delivery has had with Uber and that's something that Lyft didn't capitalize on. But still- I'm up +123% on Uber and down -24% on Lyft. Considering they essentially have the same business model, that's pretty insane. And considering how well Uber is doing, if Lyft can't do well now- can they ever? Should I just be hoping they get acquired?

Speaking of acquisition bait- I foolishly bought Bird (BRDS) a year ago and it's since down a whopping -91%. It's obviously not coming back up and they could get acquired but idk if it's worth holding out for. As much as I believe in scooters as a first/last mile option, it seems like between the local governments not supporting parking programs and people refusing to share space on the sidewalk- the shine has worn off and the startups have fizzled out. Again, if they can't do well now when everyone else is doing well- is it time to cut my losses?

Beyond Meat (BYND) is another one where I'm down -22% and just hoping that someone picks them up and bails me out. I still eat their products but I'm ready to admit that the stock isn't going anywhere.

Last one- CVS. Down -15% after trying to only buy at what I thought was going to be the all-time low (lol). What is happening? It's crazy to me. It's the one stock that I genuinely don't understand. I don't even know where to start or how to end. 

I have quite a few more stinkers- TWOU (-57%), GAN (-56%), HBI (-42%), INND (-96%), OTLY (-56%), PTRAQ (-99%), and VFC (-55%). I'm sure each have their own story.

In August 2023, foreign investors set a new record by divesting $9.8 billion in Chinese stocks, driven by escalating concerns over China's crumbling property market. This historic monthly sell-off highlights the crisis's impact on the local stock market, with offloaded stocks totaling 71.6 billion yuan ($9.8 billion), the highest since the mainland-Hong Kong stock trading link began in 2014.  
  
Despite mainland institutional investors expressing interest in Chinese stocks, the market continues to struggle. While foreign investors hold under 10% of A-shares by market cap, their preference for top-weighted stocks in the CSI 300 index grants them substantial influence. Although the index increased 0.72% to 3,723, it remains down over 7% since July.  
  
Rooted in China's property turmoil, responsible for a quarter of its economy, the sell-off follows Evergrande's bankruptcy protection filing due to a colossal debt exceeding $300 billion.

Rocket Lab successfully reflew an engine on an Electron launch Aug. 23 as the company moves a step closer to reusing the entire rocket booster.

The Electron rocket lifted off from the company’s Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 7:45 p.m. Eastern. The “We Love the Nightlife” mission deployed a Capella Space radar imaging satellite into a 640-kilometer mid-inclination orbit 58 minutes after liftoff.

The launch was originally scheduled for July 30 but scrubbed because of data from a sensor in one engine that indicated low igniter pressure. A second attempt on Aug. 6 was also scrubbed.

Rocket Lab decided to replace the entire booster with one that the company had just completed. The new booster, unlike the original one, was designed for recovery.

“The call was made to bring forward that recovery booster and swap the payload onto this Electron to tighten the turnaround to get back to the pad for Capella and accelerate our efforts to make Electron a reusable rocket at the exact same time,” Rocket Lab spokesperson Murielle Baker said during the launch webcast.

The booster not only was designed for reuse but also, among its nine Rutherford engines, was one that had flown on an Electron launch in May 2022. The engine had gone through what Rocket Lab described as multiple full-duration hotfire tests to confirm it could be flown again.

“The data is in, perfect performance from the reused engine and the stage,” Peter Beck, Rocket Lab chief executive, tweeted after the launch.

During an Aug. 8 earnings call, Beck suggested that reflying a Rutherford engine, then scheduled for some time before the end of the year, was one of the final steps before the company is ready to reuse an entire booster.

“From there we’ll schedule the first reflight of a full stage booster,” he said in the call, but did not offer a timeline for doing so beyond noting that additional improvements to support reusability were planned for the 45th flight of the vehicle.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-reuses-engine-on-electron-launch/""&gt;https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-reuses-engine-on-electron-launch/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I just want to first cover some of the popular rationale for a liquidity discount. Usually the major point is of course in the name, liquidity, being that for many micro caps and small caps, in order to exit your position, you are likely to have to exit a large position at what was previously less than market price or you’re an investor that due to circumstance (say a mutual fund), values liquidity and the ability to sell out of a position in a day without losing a significant amount of value. 

The other main point I’ve seen is really just the positive correlation between illiquidity and volatility of stock price which kind of relates to the previous point but is different. 

The context for me is my investment in Nathan’s Famous (NATH) who has a great business model built by a moat on protecting and expanding their IP while monetizing it through licensing, food distribution, franchising, and company-operated restaurants. They have a low beta of 0.20, of course beta is market-relative volatility but the low volatility is clear, giving a cost of equity under basic formula of 5.70%, if you adjust debt and keep utilized ERP, it is still 8.20%.

&amp;#x200B;

Peloton on Wednesday reported a wider-than-expected loss and a quarterly drop in new subscribers that it blamed on its recall of its Bike seat post and seasonality, sending shares plunging about 20%.

The company fell short of analysts’ earnings estimates but beat sales expectations.

Here’s how the fitness company did in its fourth fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

Loss per share: 68 cents vs. 38 cents expected

Revenue: $642.1 million vs. $639.9 million expected

The company reported a net loss of $241.8 million, or 68 cents per share, for the three-month period that ended June 30, compared with a loss of $1.26 billion, or $3.72 a share, a year earlier.

Sales dropped to $642.1 million, down $678.7 million a year earlier.

The company’s fiscal fourth quarter, which falls during the summer months, is traditionally slow not just for Peloton but also for other fitness retailers. Consumers have a tendency to pull back on workouts during the season as they travel and take part in other summer plans.

In May, CEO Barry McCarthy warned the fourth quarter would be among its most challenging from a growth perspective. For the first time, Peloton projected a decline in subscribers.

It ended the quarter with 3.08 million subscribers, up 4% year over year and in line with the company’s expectations. But compared with last quarter, subscribers declined by 29,000. Peloton attributed the drop to a “seasonal” slowdown in hardware sales and higher-than-anticipated churn.

“Peloton’s FYQ4 performance is a reminder we operate a seasonal business,” McCarthy wrote in a letter to shareholders.

“The slowdown exceeded our expectations through May and through the first three weeks of June as consumer spending shifted toward travel and experiences,” he wrote. “Then eight weeks ago the trend reversed itself, and we began to see a reacceleration in hardware sales.”

Peloton also believes the recall of its Bike seat post, which had a tendency to detach and break unexpectedly during use, created more churn than it expected. The metric stood at 1.4% for the quarter. The company suspects 15,000 to 20,000 people decided to pause their monthly subscriptions during the quarter while they waited for their seat post to be replaced.

The recall, announced in May, impacted more than 2 million Bikes the company had sold since January 2018 and cost $40 million in the quarter, far more than Peloton expected, McCarthy said. To date, the company has received 750,000 requests for replacement seat posts, which is also more than it had anticipated. So far, Peloton has fulfilled 340,000 requests and expects to wrap up the rest by the end of September.

Peloton narrowly reached positive free cash flow status on an adjusted basis, but doesn’t expect that will last during the next two quarters due to expected slowdowns in hardware sales, timing of inventory payments, marketing spending and the cash needed for the seat posts. However, it does expect to reach free cash flow positivity in the second half of fiscal 2024.

In premarket trading, Peloton’s shares plunged about 30%, but they regained some ground after the market opened. McCarthy commented on the stock price during his call with analysts, saying there is “enormous disconnect between the stock price” and the work the company is doing to drive growth.

“I don’t mean to sound like one of those CEOs who’s completely disconnected from the stock price, because it’s not lost on me,” said McCarthy. “But I have never been more optimistic, more excited about the future of the business.”

Strategy changes on the path to growth McCarthy, a former Netflix and Spotify executive, has spent the last three months focusing on new strategies aimed at getting the fitness company back on a path to growth.

The company has been working to capture customers who don’t have thousands of dollars to splurge on a stationary bike or treadmill by offering a rental program and a certified refurbished option. The rental service, which recently launched in Germany, now has more than 48,000 subscribers. The refurbished line brought in 6,500 sales during the quarter.

Both are “proving to be important growth initiatives,” McCarthy told shareholders.

Part of that strategy is the company’s rebrand under the guidance of its new Chief Marketing Officer Leslie Berland, a former Twitter (now known as X) executive. The retailer has positioned itself as a fitness company for all that is just as invested in its app as it is its pricey connected fitness products, such as its Bike, Tread and Row.

In May, it unveiled a series of new pricing tiers for its fitness app that includes an unlimited free membership option (with no credit card required) and levels that cost $12.99 and $24 monthly. The app allows consumers to watch Peloton’s fitness classes and build their own workouts from wherever they are, including their gym.

Since the relaunch, the company has clocked more than 900,000 app downloads, over two-thirds of which were non-Peloton members. It is also seeing more purchases of its higher-priced membership tier than it expected. It ended the quarter with 256,000 free monthly active users.

“The anytime, anywhere, anyplace message is absolutely landing,” McCarthy said on a call with analysts.

“The last objective \[of the relaunch\] was to remind people that, and particularly with the launch of the app, that it’s more than just a stationary bike company and that message is also finding traction.”

Peloton is also seeing “meaningful positive shifts in perception across a range of measures” including gains among Gen Z consumers and others who may be older but still new to fitness. Peloton is also seeing a shift in the types of people who are downloading its app toward men, Gen Z, Black and Hispanic consumers.

As part of the rebrand, Peloton is beginning to offer a variety of “limited edition bike frame colors and graphics to both the consumer and commercial markets,” McCarthy said.

“For the last ten years Peloton has been the Henry Ford of stationary bikes. We sold any color bike frame you wanted as long as you wanted black,” he told shareholders. “I’m excited to announce a change in strategy. ... Expect to hear more about this exciting initiative this fall.”

Peloton has also been leaning into its business-to-business strategy to further drive revenue and capture new customers. Earlier this month, it announced the launch of Peloton for Business, which allows companies to offer access to the app and its connected fitness products through its benefits offerings.

Clients include Volvo, which has Peloton bikes in its company fitness center and offers employees access to the Peloton app, its all-access membership and discounts on hardware, including the Bike, Bike+, Tread and Guide. Dropbox offers a similar package to its employees.

Peloton also launched a new program aimed at partnering with NCAA Division 1 schools. The new strategy kicked off Tuesday with its announcement that it will be partnering with the University of Michigan to create co-branded Peloton bikes that will be used at the school’s various fitness facilities – and along the sidelines at the school’s football stadium, known as the Big House.

“Expect to hear more announcements about additional global partners in the weeks ahead,” McCarthy said.

It also launched a new discounted offering for college students of its “One” tier, which typically costs $12.99 a month but will be cut to $6.99 a month.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/23/peloton-pton-earnings-q4-2023.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/23/peloton-pton-earnings-q4-2023.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I will highlight some notable quotes from the recent interview with former St. Louis Fed James Bullard. He resigned on Aug 14, 2023. Although he was known as one of the most hawkish Fed member, he was also correct over the last 2 years in expecting inflation to be sticky, and expecting the Fed to hike way more than what anyone ever anticipated. He is also one of the most bullish, arguing that the economy is more resilient than people think. He is also in the camp of shorter lag for rate hike, arguing that most of the rate hike effect have already passed through to the real economy (you can observe that when he said the easing of financial condition after SVB is feeding into a stronger 2H 2023).

&amp;#x200B;

There's an interesting statement where he said there're a lot of recession scenarios in the June 2023 FOMC dot plot (not the Fed staff forecast made by economists at the Fed, but the actual dot plot by FOMC members. In June and July, Powell said he disagreed with the Fed staff recession forecast, and the Fed revised up full year 2023 real GDP growth from 0.4% to 1%). No current Fed officials will ever admit they have a recession in their forecast. Only former Fed officials like Richard Clarida and James Bullard can talk openly about these things. To get around using the word ""recession"", Fed officials might use words like ""softish"" or ""bumpy"" landing, which are equivalent to a mild recession. I've even seen big banks like Morgan Stanley consider a mild recession as ""soft landing"", and they were the early soft landing forecasters, along with Goldman Sachs.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Bullard**: I think it’s turning out that the **Fed’s policy has been very successful**, and I think that will be the **buzz at Jackson Hole**. I don’t know what will be in the speeches, but the **talk will be that this has been quite successful**.

&amp;#x200B;

There were a lot of **heavy predictions of recession**. I think those were just **overblown**.

Because of the SVB situation, **rates actually went down in the spring**. And there’s been an unwitting **easing of financial conditions**, which is feeding into a **stronger second half for the U.S. economy**. And now everyone’s scrambling to **reprice based on that stronger economy.**

&amp;#x200B;

The f**aster growth is a bit of a threat** because the **forecast was that you’d have very weak growth or even a recession**, and now that **doesn’t really look like** it is **materializing**. So you’d have to **upgrade your outlook for inflation** probably based on that alone. You still have a **very tight labor market**, and now you have a **reacceleration in the U.S. economy**. The **risks are tilting** a little bit more toward the idea that **inflation won’t fall as fast as anticipated.**

&amp;#x200B;

Bullard: I’m **skeptical that we’re returning** to that **\[pre-pandemic environment of low interest rate and low inflation**\]. You’ve got **inflation above \[the Fed’s 2%\] target**, and it’s probably **going to be relatively sticky above target.** Roughly speaking, the **policy rate** would **have to be higher than** the **inflation rate during that whole period when inflation is above target**. That sounds like a **higher interest-rate regime** than the **one that has existed since 2008.**

&amp;#x200B;

And in the **’70s, you had similar shocks and the Fed didn’t react enough or fast enough.** They **stopped up short**, and you got a **decade of high and variable inflation**. This time **we reacted more appropriately** and more effectively, and now we’re **getting the fruits of that** by **getting inflation down.**

&amp;#x200B;

Bullard: The \[Fed’s rate-setting\] **committee will have to re-evaluate its forecast in September** for the summary of economic projections. And those **projections in June still had a big element of a recessionary scenario**—which at least, as of today, looks like it’s **blown out of the water**. That suggests that the **committee would keep its rate increase in there for sometime this fall**. It seems like you’d **probably follow through on the rate increase** that was **penciled in in June.**

The bigger question for markets, though, is **whether the economy really does accelerate quite a bit in the second half of 2023** and the **committee feels compelled** to, let’s say, **go above 6% on the policy rate**—possibly because some of the **inflation readings turn around and blip up** or maybe have a little bit of a **sustained increase.**

**I don’t think markets** are really **ready for that. But that’s an increasing risk** now.

&lt;p&gt;Because of the SVB situation, &lt;strong&gt;rates actually went down in the spring&lt;/strong&gt;. And there’s been an unwitting &lt;strong&gt;easing of financial conditions&lt;/strong&gt;, which is feeding into a &lt;strong&gt;stronger second half for the U.S. economy&lt;/strong&gt;. And now everyone’s scrambling to &lt;strong&gt;reprice based on that stronger economy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The f&lt;strong&gt;aster growth is a bit of a threat&lt;/strong&gt; because the &lt;strong&gt;forecast was that you’d have very weak growth or even a recession&lt;/strong&gt;, and now that &lt;strong&gt;doesn’t really look like&lt;/strong&gt; it is &lt;strong&gt;materializing&lt;/strong&gt;. So you’d have to &lt;strong&gt;upgrade your outlook for inflation&lt;/strong&gt; probably based on that alone. You still have a &lt;strong&gt;very tight labor market&lt;/strong&gt;, and now you have a &lt;strong&gt;reacceleration in the U.S. economy&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;risks are tilting&lt;/strong&gt; a little bit more toward the idea that &lt;strong&gt;inflation won’t fall as fast as anticipated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullard: I’m &lt;strong&gt;skeptical that we’re returning&lt;/strong&gt; to that &lt;strong&gt;[pre-pandemic environment of low interest rate and low inflation&lt;/strong&gt;]. You’ve got &lt;strong&gt;inflation above [the Fed’s 2%] target&lt;/strong&gt;, and it’s probably &lt;strong&gt;going to be relatively sticky above target.&lt;/strong&gt; Roughly speaking, the &lt;strong&gt;policy rate&lt;/strong&gt; would &lt;strong&gt;have to be higher than&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;inflation rate during that whole period when inflation is above target&lt;/strong&gt;. That sounds like a &lt;strong&gt;higher interest-rate regime&lt;/strong&gt; than the &lt;strong&gt;one that has existed since 2008.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the &lt;strong&gt;’70s, you had similar shocks and the Fed didn’t react enough or fast enough.&lt;/strong&gt; They &lt;strong&gt;stopped up short&lt;/strong&gt;, and you got a &lt;strong&gt;decade of high and variable inflation&lt;/strong&gt;. This time &lt;strong&gt;we reacted more appropriately&lt;/strong&gt; and more effectively, and now we’re &lt;strong&gt;getting the fruits of that&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;getting inflation down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullard: The [Fed’s rate-setting] &lt;strong&gt;committee will have to re-evaluate its forecast in September&lt;/strong&gt; for the summary of economic projections. And those &lt;strong&gt;projections in June still had a big element of a recessionary scenario&lt;/strong&gt;—which at least, as of today, looks like it’s &lt;strong&gt;blown out of the water&lt;/strong&gt;. That suggests that the &lt;strong&gt;committee would keep its rate increase in there for sometime this fall&lt;/strong&gt;. It seems like you’d &lt;strong&gt;probably follow through on the rate increase&lt;/strong&gt; that was &lt;strong&gt;penciled in in June.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger question for markets, though, is &lt;strong&gt;whether the economy really does accelerate quite a bit in the second half of 2023&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;committee feels compelled&lt;/strong&gt; to, let’s say, &lt;strong&gt;go above 6% on the policy rate&lt;/strong&gt;—possibly because some of the &lt;strong&gt;inflation readings turn around and blip up&lt;/strong&gt; or maybe have a little bit of a &lt;strong&gt;sustained increase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t think markets&lt;/strong&gt; are really &lt;strong&gt;ready for that. But that’s an increasing risk&lt;/strong&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

* The new contract includes pay raises for both part-time and full-time workers.
* It also includes other improvements to work rules including an end to forced overtime.

American Airlines also approved 46% increase in compensation and the UAW is also demanding 46% increase in compensation, voting on August 22nd whether or not to authorize a strike.

UPS workers ratified a massive five-year labor deal that includes big wage increases and other improvements to work rules and schedules, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said Tuesday.

The deal passed with 86.3% of votes, the highest contract vote in the history of Teamsters at UPS, according to the union.

“Teamsters have set a new standard and raised the bar for pay, benefits, and working conditions in the package delivery industry. This is the template for how workers should be paid and protected nationwide, and nonunion companies like Amazon better pay attention,” Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien said in a statement.

UPS and the Teamsters union, which represents about 340,000 workers at the delivery giant, reached a preliminary deal last month, narrowly averting a strike that could have rippled throughout the U.S. economy as the previous contract expiration on July 31 approached.

UPS moves $3.8 billion worth of goods a day, about 5% of the country’s gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The parties had until July 31, when the previous labor contract was set to expire, to reach a deal and avoid a work stoppage. Workers began voting on the new contract on August 2. It’s the single largest collective bargaining agreement ever reached in the private sector, according to the union.

Part-time workers will make no less than $21 an hour, up from a minimum of $15.50 currently, according to the union. Part-time pay was a sticking point during labor negotiations. Full-time workers will average $49 an hour. Current workers will get $2.75 more an hour this year and $7.50 an hour more during the five-year contract.

UPS drivers will average $170,000 in pay and benefits at the end of the five-year deal, CEO Carol Tomé said on an earnings call earlier this month.

The company cut its full-year revenue and margin forecasts, citing the “volume impact from labor negotiations and the costs associated with the tentative agreement.”

The union is the latest labor organization to push a major U.S. company for better pay, schedules and other work rules in the wake of the pandemic and decades-high inflation.

On Monday, American Airlines
pilots ratified a four-year deal that includes roughly 46% increases in compensation, including 401(k) contributions, a deal the carrier sweetened after rival United Airlines reached a richer agreement with its pilots’ union. Delta Air Lines

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street tried to build momentum following positive sessions for the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 109 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures both added about 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite posted its biggest advance of the month during Monday’s main trading session, rising 1.6%. The S&amp;P 500 added close to 0.7%. The two benchmarks snapped a four-day slide, and the Nasdaq notched its biggest one-day advance since August. The Dow ticked down 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Notably, the broad market index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were able to post gains even as the yield on the 10-year Treasury reached its highest level since November 2007, gaining about 9 basis points to trade at 4.34%. Tech shares historically struggle in a high-rate environment, making the tandem rise with yields on Monday more striking for Wall Street.
*****
&gt; “We’re seeing a positive return in the stock market, [which] we didn’t see last week. We think rates are going to be higher for longer and maybe the stock market’s okay with it,” Katy Kaminski, chief market strategist at AlphaSimplex, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; To be sure, some on Wall Street are not confident the rally can continue for much longer.
*****
&gt; “Typically, spikes in Treasury yields expose other areas of weakness. The rise in yields will make debt refinancing even more burdensome. … Another reason yields are rising is that investors are beginning to get realistic on the Fed’s path (more rate hikes may come),” said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.
*****
&gt; “This is a risk to tech stocks and growth stocks with high PE multiples. Therefore, we expect additional downside in the equity market is likely,” Horneman continued.
*****
&gt; Consumer retail giants Lowe’s and Macy’s reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday before the bell. Lowe’s gained 2.5% premarket after posting mixed results but reaffirming its full-year guidance, while Macy’s stock price edged lower on a cautious forecast for the full year.
*****
&gt; Investors are keeping a close eye on Nvidia’s earnings due Wednesday. Its shares rose more than 8% Monday, making it one of the largest tech gainers. The company is largely seen as a bellwether on the AI-boom and sentiment.
*****
&gt; On the economic data front, Wall Street will be looking toward the Philadelphia Fed’s nonmanufacturing survey, as well as the Richmond Fed’s manufacturing survey results. Existing home sales data for July is also scheduled for release Tuesday morning.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s remarks at Jackson Hole on Friday for more insight on the central bank’s inflation outlook.

710,stocks,"In the world of finance, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed how trading is conducted. One prominent AI model that has garnered attention is ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI. While AI has shown remarkable capabilities, especially in natural language processing, it is essential to explore whether human stock traders still possess a distinct edge. In this article, we delve into the nuances of stock trading, highlighting the unique qualities that make human traders superior to ChatGPT.


**Intuition and Emotional Intelligence**
Human stock traders possess an innate ability to leverage intuition and emotional intelligence when making investment decisions. They can factor in market sentiment, news events, and global trends that might not be fully captured by AI models like ChatGPT. For instance, during times of economic uncertainty, human traders can intuitively navigate market volatility, adjusting their strategies based on a nuanced understanding of the prevailing emotions. This aspect of human trading can significantly impact decision-making and yield successful outcomes.

**Adaptability to Market Dynamics**
Markets are inherently complex and dynamic, influenced by various factors such as geopolitical events, economic indicators, and unexpected news. Human traders are better equipped to adapt to these changing dynamics, as they can quickly process and interpret new information. Unlike ChatGPT, which relies on pre-existing data and patterns, human traders can apply their knowledge and adapt their strategies in real time to capitalize on emerging opportunities or mitigate risks.

**Contextual Understanding**
Stock trading involves more than just numbers and patterns. It requires a deep understanding of the broader economic and business landscape. Human traders possess the ability to discern contextual cues that might not be evident in datasets used by AI models. This understanding allows them to anticipate market shifts and make informed decisions based on their comprehensive grasp of market dynamics.

**Complex Decision-Making**
The decisions made by human traders often involve multifaceted considerations that go beyond quantitative analysis. Factors like company leadership, industry trends, and long-term growth potential play a vital role in investment choices. Human traders can synthesize various pieces of information, apply critical thinking, and make judgments that are not solely reliant on historical data – a level of complexity that AI models like ChatGPT might struggle to replicate.

**Unpredictability and Black Swan Events**
Financial markets are susceptible to black swan events – rare, unexpected occurrences that can have a profound impact on global economies and markets. The COVID-19 pandemic serves as a recent example of such an event. Human traders have the cognitive flexibility to respond to unprecedented situations and adjust their strategies accordingly. Their ability to think beyond conventional patterns is crucial when faced with these unforeseen challenges.

**Ethical Considerations and Accountability**
While AI models like ChatGPT lack moral agency, human traders are accountable for their decisions. They are bound by ethical considerations and the consequences of their actions. This accountability fosters responsible decision-making and prevents the implementation of strategies that might yield short-term gains at the expense of long-term stability – a restraint that AI models might not inherently possess.

**Subjective Evaluation of Data**
Human traders have the capacity to evaluate data subjectively, considering qualitative factors that might not be directly quantifiable. This allows them to develop a more holistic view of a company's potential and make investment choices that align with their convictions. For instance, they can assess corporate culture, values, and future prospects through a lens that AI models might struggle to replicate due to the inherent subjectivity involved.

While AI models like ChatGPT have showcased remarkable capabilities in various fields, the realm of stock trading remains an area where human traders maintain a distinct edge. The ability to leverage intuition, adapt to dynamic market conditions, understand context, make complex decisions, and respond to unpredictable events sets human traders apart. Furthermore, the ethical considerations, accountability, and the capacity for subjective evaluation of data make human traders an indispensable presence in the financial world.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Evidently they have a lot of orders currently with big deposits, along with a backlog of 1,900,000 orders waiting to be filled with a late 2023 or early 2024 release date.  
According to this article, that is a five-year backlog.  

“Tesla Cybertruck Orders Surpass 1.9 Million, 5 Year Wait Times” 

There are now over 1.9 million orders for the long-awaited Tesla Cybertruck, per a crowd-sourced data tracker. Speaking on an Earnings Call earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that demand for the Cybertruck is ""so off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.”

Given that Tesla plans to produce 375,000 Cybertrucks a year at peak capacity, new orders will technically take around 5 years to arrive. 

It seems to me that Tesla would be a great place to jump in if it falls to $200 per share.  I don’t see it going much lower than $200.00

719,stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- An exchange-traded fund that aimed to track CNBC anchor Jim Cramer’s stock picks is planning to shutter just five months after launching.

The Long Cramer Tracker ETF (ticker LJIM) will stop trading Sept. 11, according to a press release Monday. The fund, which buys stocks recommended by the host of CNBC’s Mad Money show, has only managed to attract $1.3 million in assets amid gains of just 2.2% since its debut in March.

Tuttle Capital Management chief executive Matt Tuttle launched LJIM alongside the $3.4 million Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF (SJIM), which bets against Cramer’s stock calls and will continue to trade. While LJIM has actually outperformed its bearish Cramer counterpart, Tuttle says he is shutting the fund after failing to attract the attention of the CNBC host. 

“We started LJIM in order to facilitate a conversation with Jim Cramer around his stock picks as the other side to the Short Cramer ETF,” Tuttle said in the press release. “Unfortunately, Mr. Cramer and CNBC have been unwilling to engage in dialogue and instead have chosen to ignore the funds, therefore there is no reason to keep the long side going. Going forward we will just focus on the short side.”

A CNBC spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Despite a slide in August, LJIM has gained about 2.2% on a total return basis since inception, with Nvidia Corp., Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Oracle Corp. among its biggest holdings. SJIM, which also short-sells Cramer’s picks in addition to buying companies he recommends against, has dropped 4.4% over that span. 

Tuttle told Bloomberg’s Trillions podcast in March that he and two colleagues monitor Cramer’s television appearances and social media accounts to put together the fund’s actively managed portfolios, which charge 1.2%. A CNBC spokesperson said at the time that Cramer encourages long-term investing through “a balanced portfolio that includes index funds and individual stocks.”

Tuttle is behind some of the $7.4 trillion ETF industry’s more infamous products. In addition to the Cramer funds, he’s also behind the $240 million AXS Short Innovation Daily ETF (SARK), which wagers against Cathie Wood’s flagship fund

----------------------------

According to the latest New York Federal Reserve employment survey released Monday, the average “reservation wage,” or the minimum acceptable salary offer to switch jobs, rose to $78,645 during the second quarter of 2023.

That’s an increase of about 8% from just a year ago and is the highest level ever in a data series that goes back to the beginning of 2014. Over the past three years, which entails the Covid era, the level has risen more than 22%.

The number is significant in that wages increasingly have been recognized as a driving force in inflation. While goods prices have abated since pushing overall inflation to its highest level in more than 40 years in mid-2022, other factors continue to keep it well above the Fed’s targeted rate of 2%.

The New York Fed data is consistent with an Atlanta Fed tracker, which shows wages overall rising at a 6% annual rate but job switchers seeing 7% gains.

Employers have been trying to keep pace with the wage demands, pushing the average full-time offer up to $69,475, a 14% surge in the past year. The actual expected annual salary rose to $67,416, a gain of more than $7,000 from a year ago and also a new high.

Though there was a gap between the wage workers wanted and what was offered, satisfaction with compensation and upward mobility increased across the board.

With markets on edge over what the Fed’s next policy step will be, more signs of a tight labor market raise the likelihood that policymakers will keep interest rates higher for longer. At their July meeting, officials noted that wages “were still rising at rates above levels assessed to be consistent with the sustained achievement” of the 2% inflation goal, minutes from the meeting said.

Monday’s survey results also showed some other mixed patterns in the labor market.

Job seekers, or those who have looked for work in the previous four weeks, declined to 19.4% from 24.7% a year ago. That came as job openings fell by 738,000 to 9.58 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The likelihood of switching jobs fell, dropping to 10.6% from 11% a year ago, while expectations of being offered a new job also declined, to 18.7% from 21.1%.

725,stocks,"Once in a while, I get a message or an email, with a certain company name that has a price/book ratio below 1, and the question at the end is ""What am I missing"" or ""Does this make sense""?

The goal of this post is to elaborate on why a low price-to-book ratio doesn't necessarily mean a company is cheap. The post is divided into the following segments:

\- The theory

\- Example - Big Lots

\- Going concern

\- Conclusion  
**The theory**

The theory is quite simple. If a company has a price-to-book ratio of 1, the market price is in line with the book value of the company.

If the ratio is below 1, you can buy the **book value** of the company for a lower price. Should you buy a company with such a ratio, you get more than what you pay for (**in accounting terms**). 

On the other side, if the ratio is above 1, you'll be paying a premium compared to the **book value**.

I've bolded a couple of words, and that's where the catch is.  
**Example - Big Lots**

Although the theory is simple, the practice is not so much.

Let me introduce you to Big Lots, a furniture &amp; home decor retailer.

Its market cap is roughly $210m. Let's assume that you have the option to buy the entire company for $250 (a premium is often paid for a transaction of this type). **This is the price.**

If you take a look at the book value (which is total assets minus total liabilities), that is equal to $550 million! **This is the book value.**

Based on these two numbers, we can calculate a price-to-book ratio of 0.45.

So, can you not buy the entire business for $250, sell all the assets, pay all the liabilities, and collect the remaining $550? In this case, **we assume that the book value is equal to the liquidation value.**

  
*Imagine that you've done this. You've paid $250 million and now you own Big Lots. Now what?*

Let's see what that would look like in practice: Big Lots has total assets of $3.66 billion and total liabilities of $3.11 billion.

The 3 big buckets when it comes to assets are:

\- $1.1 billion of inventories  
\- $1.5 billion of operating leases (Right-of-use assets)  
\- $750 million of property, plant, and equipment

This explains over 90% of all the assets. So, how can this be converted into cash, so the liabilities can be settled, and you are left with $550 million?

&amp;#x200B;

***Inventories***

  
How can one get rid of $1.1 billion of inventories? There are two main ways:

1. As this is a retail company, you can choose to sell them through regular business operations. The catch? The company is not profitable. Over the last quarter, it sold $730m of inventories for $1.1 billion in net sales and reported a net loss above $200m. To sell $1.1 billion of inventories, it would take around 5 months, and it is quite clear that the outcome will not be $1.1 billion in cash, but closer to $700m (assuming the company losses $400m throughout these 5 months). But imagine what this would look like. You have all the stores with 100% inventory, then 80% inventory, then 50% inventory, then 20% inventory. It is unlikely that the inventory will go down to 0 unless special discounts are offered. Which means the $700m mentioned above, might be an overstatement.
2. You could call a competitor, and offer them the inventory. You'll likely hear a positive answer and an offer of $500m or $600m. Wait, you might ask, isn't the book value $1.1 billion? How come the offer is so low? Big Lots paid $1.1 billion to the manufacturing companies, to buy the inventory and have it delivered to their stores/warehouses. The competitors can do exactly the same, for the same price. In addition, the competitors don't have to order $1.1 billion at once and tie a lot of their capital. They could order a lot less. Therefore, you, as the new owner of Big Lots, have no negotiation power.  


Already, you can see that the **book value is not equal to the liquidation value**. This is only one of the three main assets of the business.

  
***Operating leases (Right-of-use assets)***

The previous owners/managers of the business, have signed numerous leasing contracts (for properties, equipment, vehicles, etc.) and these assets provide value to Big Lots. Canceling these contracts would also remove the lease liability on the other side of the balance sheet.

So, this should be straightforward, right? Not really, no.

To expect that you can ring anyone, and cancel the contract ""as of tomorrow"" is unreasonable.   
There will either be a notice period or a cancellation fee/fine.

  
***Property, plant and equipment***

At least this one should be easy, right? Well, I have some bad news.

Selling land &amp; buildings in today's market might not be the most difficult task. But how about all the equipment and vehicles that the company owns? I'm referring to the small ones such as stalls and cash registers, all the way to their forklifts and delivery vehicles.

To get rid of them on short notice, you'd have to sell them at a discount.

&amp;#x200B;

***What else is missing?***

This is not all. How about the employees? Liquidating a company of this size will not happen without severance pays.    
**Going concern**

So, why do we have those book values if they don't represent the liquidation value? Because there is something called **""going concern""**. It is a fundamental assumption, that the company (in this case Big Lots), will remain operating into the foreseeable future, rather than undergo a liquidation.

Therefore, the financial statements have been prepared on a **""going concern basis""**.  
**Conclusion**

This is a simple example, that illustrates how different the liquidation value might be compared to the book value. Imagine if there was $1 billion of goodwill on the balance sheet. That's not something that you can sell.

Let me be clear, this post has nothing to do with Big Lots and its value. It is solely here for educational purposes. There are plenty of scenarios that could happen to the company in the future. It could become profitable again, it could get acquired, it could go bankrupt, or it could be in a tough spot for a long time.

On the other side, think of companies with high price-to-book value in the tech industry. These companies do not have to invest heavily in assets, so using the price-to-book ratio is completely pointless.

*****
&gt; Stock futures were higher Monday as Wall Street tried to recover from another weekly decline.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.5%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 125 points, or nearly 0.4%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.6%.
*****
&gt; Palo Alto Networks jumped 12.4% in premarket trading after reporting earnings results late Friday that topped analysts’ estimates. As of Friday’s close, the stock was down by 16% this month.
*****
&gt; Investors are coming off a weekly decline as the market struggles through the summer doldrums. The Nasdaq Composite closed the week lower about 2.6%, down for a third straight week for the first time since December. Meanwhile, the Dow closed the week lower by 2.2%, its worst streak since March. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 2.1% and posted its third consecutive losing week, which hadn’t happened since February.
*****
&gt; Investors digested rising bond yields and weakness out of China that put a damper on markets during a typically lackluster season.

&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 is sitting in short-term oversold territory, a technical measure encompassing numerous components including investor sentiment along with a host of more esoteric measures,” Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, wrote on Friday.

&gt; Now, investors are awaiting the latest quarterly results from key artificial intelligence beneficiary Nvidia on Wednesday. They’re also anticipating an address Friday morning from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

# Introduction:

DUOL is a freemium app that offers language learning in a gamified form. It is the largest language learning app by subscriber in the market and the only one which can be used almost entirely free. Management's path forward is well defined, releasing an additional tier that utilizes generative AI to personalize the learning experience and leveraging off any future AI development to help with their business. Management has identified 3 broad areas that they are working on (1) how well they teach, (2) how well they monetize and (3) how well they retain.  


# Investment Thesis 1:

***Advantageous Business Model***  
DUOL is free to use as compared to their competitors, this easy access to DUOL may be advantageous as 67% of people want their language learning app to be free ([SOURCE](https://civicscience.com/the-word-on-language-learning-apps-whats-behind-their-growing-popularity/#:~:text=Single%2Dlanguage%20speakers%20are%20likely,become%20fluent%20in%20another%20language)). Their close competitors such as Rosetta Stone, Babbel and Busuu all require a monthly subscription. DUOL is currently the only language learning app to be able to offer their services for free (excluding in-app purchases) as they are supplemented by their advertising arm of the business. DUOL is the only one able to set up a significant advertising arm due to their very high Monthly Active Users (MAU).  


# Investment Thesis 2:

***Strong Word of Mouth Advertising***  
With the largest MAU out of all of their competitors this advantage snowballs on its own, DUOL is able to save a significant portion on advertising as their MAU helps DUOL to advertise. By posting their ""streaks"" or achievements e.g. year in review it helps to spread the word for DUOL. ""80% of Duolingo’s users were acquired through word of mouth"" ([SOURCE](https://www.adexchanger.com/strategy/organic-marketing-is-duolingos-lingua-franca/))  


# REVENUE:

  
DUOL’s management has recognized 2 sources of revenue  (1) “Bookings” and (2) Revenue. The difference is that Bookings represent the total potential revenue that can be collected from subscribers, whereas revenue is when DUOL has actually given the goods and services and can recognize revenue. I believe that in my forecast I should forecast revenue rather than bookings as subscription revenue is not actual revenue in pocket yet, subscribers could cancel at any point of time so I will apply the conservatism principle here.   
  
For Monthly Active Users(MAU), I’ll use Q4 of each year’s numbers.   
To Forecast MAU, I believe that DUOL’s subscriber growth trajectory will be similar to other subscription based model e.g. NFLX. They will experience explosive growth followed by mediocre growth as they switch to focusing on monetizing existing MAU. As DUOL has just started catching on, I assume that the high growth period will be 5 years followed by mediocre growth of 2 years before tapering to slow growth for the rest of my forecast. High growth Y/Y was taking historic trends, mediocre and slow growth is taking about half of the previous phase’s Y/Y.  
  
For Paid Subscribers, I’ll use Q4 of each year’s numbers.   
To Forecast Paid Subscribers, I took it as a %MAU. Opting for less granularity, I assumed that they follow historic trends and only had a meager increase. The reason for a meager increase is because I believe that consumers taste and preference for subscription remains more or less the same throughout my forecast.  
  
To Forecast Monthly Revenue/Paid subscribers, I’ll assume that the first 2 years the declining trend will continue as management has stated that they “lowered pricing -- prices in several countries to get our prices more in line with each country's GDP per capita.” - Q4 2022 Earnings Conference. After the 2 years, as the economy begins picking up I’ll assume a modest growth in monthly revenue/paid subscribers. And given that DUOL max will be developed and released to a greater extent I’ll assume that this helps the Y/Y as well. Overall Monthly Revenue/Paid Subscribers from 2020 had only a CAGR of 0.8% for my base case which I believe is realistic.  


# COST:

***Cost of Goods Sold***  
DUOL’s 2022 10-K has stated that COGS mainly comes from “third-party payment processing fees charged by various distribution channels”. Apple charges a 30% fee for app purchases. DUOL’s gross margins are slightly above this 30% fee at 73% mainly because there are other revenue sources that circumvent the app store e.g. Advertising. Opting for less granularity I’d forecast gross margins at 70% overtime as DUOL’s revenue sources becomes mainly subscription.   
  
***Operating Cost***  
R&amp;D, the fluctuations in R&amp;D will follow the CapEX cycle of 3 years of being half of historic average and 3 years of ramping up to scale for monetization before tapering off.   
  
Marketing, DUOL has stated that most of their advertisement is organic meaning that they don’t create ad campaigns but rather other users of a social media platform create content about DUOL. I’d assume that DUOL follows historic averages.  
  
G&amp;A, “We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. However, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will remain steady or decrease as a percentage of our revenues as our revenues grow faster than these expenses over the long-term.” - 2022 Q4 10-K. I assume that the nominal amount for G&amp;A grows at a meager rate before holding it constant at the end of the monetization phase.  


# CAPEX:

  
Management wants to capitalize past R&amp;D, “to continue to compound the returns we've seen from our past R&amp;D investments, so we don't plan to hire as many people as we did last year.” - Q4 2022 Earnings Conference. So I'd assume that CapEX has 3 years of being half of historic average and 3 years of ramping up to scale for monetization before becoming capital efficient.  
  


# Change in NWC Schedule:

  
  
***Day A/R and A/P***  
I don’t think that there is much room for DUOL to improve day A/R given that most of their receivables are from the AppStore and PlayStore. And management also has stated their intent to not shift payment methodology off the Stores according to the 2022 Q4 Earnings conference. I assumed the same will happen for Day A/P.  
  
***Deferred Cost of Revenue and Revenue***  
Forecasted as a % of revenue, it’s hard to predict which customers will or will not pay so I opted for less granularity.  


***Others***  
Forecasted as a % of revenue, I opted for less granularity.  


# WACC:

  
***Cost of Equity***  
RFR (1M Avg) = 3.82%  
Market Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DUOL/)) = 0.36  
Earnings Yield (1M Avg) = 3.98%  
S&amp;P 500 (1M Avg) = $4467.72  
Growth Forecast ([SOURCE](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/credit-suisse-ups-sp-500-year-end-forecast-4700-2023-07-18/#:~:text=The%20S%26P%20500%20is%20currently,company%20earnings%20and%20to%20buybacks))  
4050 = (4700 x 3.98%) / (1+R) + (4700 x (1+7%)) x 3.98% / (1+R)\^2 + (5029 x 3.98%) x (1 + 2%) / (R - 2%) / (1+R)\^3  
R = 9.12%   
ERP = 5.30%  
COE = 5.73%  
***Cost of Debt***  
DUOL does not have a bond rating, neither can I use a synthetic rating as DUOL has a negative EBIT. So the best case scenario here is to use management’s discount rate for debt. ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/y2RuXSG))  
COD taken to be 6.92%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21%  
After Tax COD = 5.47%  


Weightage   
Management has broken down operating lease ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/95wZU0H))  
Assuming that 2022 is lease cost is the only interest expense going forward.  
MV Debt = 60.4M   
Average Stock Price (1M Avg) = $123.40  
Shares O/S = 40.6M  
MV Equity = 5010.0M  
%Equity = 98.8%  
%Debt = 1.2%  
WACC = 5.73%  


# SANITY CHECK:

([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/vQV7JAj))  
Worse Case: Subscriber Y/Y 9% CAGR  
Base Case: Subscriber Y/Y 12% CAGR  
Best Case: Subscriber Y/Y 15% CAGR  
Under the base case scenario, DUOL will be reinvesting a very large sum (inclusive of R&amp;D) for below historic ROIC by a significant margin. And I’m assuming a Y/Y CAGR of 12% for subscriber growth compared to 2022’s 40+% Y/Y. I do believe that my assumptions are realistic.  


# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, I value DUOL at $192.29 in my base case. I do believe that management has a clear direction in which they wish to take the firm in and have held true to their belief in AI since the very beginning. I believe that the language learning app is a product where consumers want it to be low maintenance i.e. Logging in daily to continue the streak without having to break the bank. With competitors product having a subscription model it stresses the consumer out having to ""make their moneys worth"".

&lt;p&gt;Management wants to capitalize past R&amp;amp;D, “to continue to compound the returns we&amp;#39;ve seen from our past R&amp;amp;D investments, so we don&amp;#39;t plan to hire as many people as we did last year.” - Q4 2022 Earnings Conference. So I&amp;#39;d assume that CapEX has 3 years of being half of historic average and 3 years of ramping up to scale for monetization before becoming capital efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Change in NWC Schedule:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Day A/R and A/P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think that there is much room for DUOL to improve day A/R given that most of their receivables are from the AppStore and PlayStore. And management also has stated their intent to not shift payment methodology off the Stores according to the 2022 Q4 Earnings conference. I assumed the same will happen for Day A/P.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deferred Cost of Revenue and Revenue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forecasted as a % of revenue, it’s hard to predict which customers will or will not pay so I opted for less granularity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Others&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

4050 = (4700 x 3.98%) / (1+R) + (4700 x (1+7%)) x 3.98% / (1+R)^2 + (5029 x 3.98%) x (1 + 2%) / (R - 2%) / (1+R)^3&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cost of Debt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
DUOL does not have a bond rating, neither can I use a synthetic rating as DUOL has a negative EBIT. So the best case scenario here is to use management’s discount rate for debt. (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/y2RuXSG""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;

Base Case: Subscriber Y/Y 12% CAGR&lt;br/&gt;
Best Case: Subscriber Y/Y 15% CAGR&lt;br/&gt;
Under the base case scenario, DUOL will be reinvesting a very large sum (inclusive of R&amp;amp;D) for below historic ROIC by a significant margin. And I’m assuming a Y/Y CAGR of 12% for subscriber growth compared to 2022’s 40+% Y/Y. I do believe that my assumptions are realistic.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I value DUOL at $192.29 in my base case. I do believe that management has a clear direction in which they wish to take the firm in and have held true to their belief in AI since the very beginning. I believe that the language learning app is a product where consumers want it to be low maintenance i.e. Logging in daily to continue the streak without having to break the bank. With competitors product having a subscription model it stresses the consumer out having to &amp;quot;make their moneys worth&amp;quot;.    &lt;/p&gt;

731,stocks,"Hey everyone! This post is going to breakdown Netflix. I am going to provide a detailed overview of the company and then find out if it meets our four investment principles (Circle of Competence, Competent Management, MOAT &amp; Margin of Safety). This is a very long post because I want to explain my rationale. This analysis is going to be broken down into four sections:

1. History/Overview of the Company
2. Qualitative Analysis
3. Quantitative Analysis
4. Buy Price

**History of Netflix:**

Netflix launched in 1998 as an online movie rental service. When Netflix began, they offered a subscription package allowing members to rent as many movies as they want for $19.95. The deal was that Netflix subscribers can keep DVDs, up to three at any one time, for as long as they wish. At the time, Netflix's largest competitor was Blockbuster, and funny enough, Netflix offered to sell their business to Blockbuster in 2000 and Blockbuster rejected the deal.This turned out to be a huge mistake for Blockbuster because Netflix forced Blockbuster into bankruptcy. How did Netflix go from offering their business to stealing consumers away from Blockbuster? There are four reasons which I will break down but the overarching answer is that Netflix just offered far more favourable options to consumers at a much lower cost. Let me explain.  
*Better deals:* Subscribers can order a movie online with next-day delivery. Netflix subscribers were able to hold on their DVD as long as they needed without late fees. When it's time to return a movie, a subscriber puts it back into the postage-paid mailers that came with and drops it into a mailbox with no shipping fees.  
*Forward thinking:* Netflix was investing in technology and consumers really liked the personalised recommendations by their software (Netflix recommends titles based on user's previous choices). Brick and Mortar stores like Blockbuster relied on store clerks who knew nothing about their customers' movie tastes.  
*Lower operating costs = better value for consumers:* In 2004, Netflix's logistics systems included only 30 distribution centres throughout the United States. A typical Brick and Mortar store like Blockbuster would take more than 500 video stores to serve the Los Angeles area, while Netflix served the same market with only one warehouse. Because of lower operating costs, Netflix were able to pass on those cost advantages to consumers, offering subscription rental around 50% cheaper than same-store subscription rental.  
*Online streaming:* Netflix invested in online streaming since they recognised that video-on-demand was gaining popularity. Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010.  
**Overview:**

Netflix is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 238 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Netflix is available virtually everywhere except in China and Russia. Members can play, pause, and resume to watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.While consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of “winning moments of truth”. In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.  
**Qualitative Analysis:**

Reed Hastings is currently Chairman of the Board and is the founder of Netflix. Reed Hastings has a history of purchasing Netflix shares indirectly and has a good compensation structure.

There is no doubt that Netflix has a lot of competitors. They compete against linear TV such as broadcast and cable television and other video streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Apple TV, Disney/Hulu, Youtube, HBO. However, Netflix does hold competitive advantages:

* *Linear:* Netflix is much more flexible over linear TV. Netflix is not competing for scarce time-slots whereas linear TV present programs only at particular time. Netflix is on demand, whenever someone wants to watch a show.
* *Netflix produces their own content with their own studio and this is becoming a major source of Netflix:* There is an argument that states Apple and Amazon does the same. Firstly Apple TV is operating at a loss in that segment and is relying on its more profitable lines to make up for that segment. Amazon Prime recently started operating at a profit however there are a few things worth noting.

1. Amazon Prime memberships are available in only 27 countries, whereas Netflix is available in over 190 countries. Furthermore, Amazon is very diversified so they have a limited focus, whereas Netflix's only focus is providing entertainment to consumers.
2. Netflix has a successful track record of producing local stories to reflect the different tastes in different countries and made them available and popular worldwide. Think of Netflix originals such as Money Heist (Spain), Squid Game (South Korea), Alice In wonderland (Tokyo, Japan). Without Netflix, a lot of international series and movies would have never achieved global penetration.  

3. Netflix original films bypasses the Cinemas and Netflix gets original access: This also makes Netflix a competitor to theatres, except that theatres have limited seats and time slots, Netflix does not.
4. Furthermore, Netflix licenses from other studios in the first pay TV window (the ""pay one"" window). This means Netflix gets first access after theatrical release of licensed content. Pay-one movies debut very well after theatrical release with a lot of viewership and Netflix has the ability to carry the film for 18-24 months. The result: Netflix has more viewing time than their competitors.

**Quantitative Analysis:**

Although Netflix has a bigger market share compared to other streaming platforms (some countries Youtube has the lead), Netflix market share is just under 10% so there is still significant room to grow.

This is where it is important to pay attention when it comes down to valuing Netflix. At first glance, it looks like membership growth is decelerating from 20% growth to under 10%. However, there are a couple things to consider.

* Last year, Netflix stock price plummeted due to losing memberships in Q1 and Q2. When Netflix reported losing -0.2 million subscribers in Q1, this was because they withdrew there services from Russia that resulted in a -0.7million impact on paid net adds; therefore, excluding this impact, paid net add would have been +0.5m.
* At the time, Netflix just announced paid sharing and there was a lot of initial negative reaction with consumers deleting their Netflix accounts. However, this turned out to be temporary and Netflix subscriber growth quickly improved after that. (One thing to keep in mind is this: *20 years ago, people were paying $5 for a single new rental DVD release, and around $60 for cable. Back then, the general cost of goods and services aren't anywhere like it is today due to inflation*. ***People will always pay for entertainment, so Netflix paid sharing impact on subscriber growth was always going to temporary.***
* Netflix has entered into the advertising business and so far it is proving to be successful. Consumers are benefitting because of lower price points, Netflix is benefiting because of increased subscriber growth and the advertising segment has better margins.  
How did I calculate Free Cash Flow?

Netflix pays a substantial amount each year for content and it is hard to determine what portion of that content spend is considered maintenance capital expenditure and what portion is considered growth capital expenditure. To make this process easy, I have calculated free cash flow by taking:

* Cash Flow from operations + Additions to Content Assets - Amortization of content Assets - Purchases of Property &amp; Equipment = Free Cash Flow.  
I also believe that this is a conservative estimate of Free Cash Flow because amortisation is on an accelerated basis. Over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is amortised within 4 years after it first becomes available. There are tax laws preventing management from speeding up depreciation of tangible property but since intangible assets such as content is extremely difficult to measure, management can speed up the amortization process. ***Management is incentivised to do this because a higher amortization expense (which is a non-cash expense) reduces the amount of taxes Netflix has to pay!***  


**BUY PRICE:** 

If you made it this far in the post then congratulations. My buy price ranges from ***$182 to around $250***. I have used the discount cash flow calculator using the current year free cash flow (2022). The former assumes a growth rate of 15% with a 15% discount rate. The latter assumes a growth rate of 10% with a 10% discount rate. I missed out on a bargain last year but I only began looking into Netflix a few weeks ago.  
I'll end this analysis with this quote.

&lt;p&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;
This is where it is important to pay attention when it comes down to valuing Netflix. At first glance, it looks like membership growth is decelerating from 20% growth to under 10%. However, there are a couple things to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last year, Netflix stock price plummeted due to losing memberships in Q1 and Q2. When Netflix reported losing -0.2 million subscribers in Q1, this was because they withdrew there services from Russia that resulted in a -0.7million impact on paid net adds; therefore, excluding this impact, paid net add would have been +0.5m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the time, Netflix just announced paid sharing and there was a lot of initial negative reaction with consumers deleting their Netflix accounts. However, this turned out to be temporary and Netflix subscriber growth quickly improved after that. (One thing to keep in mind is this: &lt;em&gt;20 years ago, people were paying $5 for a single new rental DVD release, and around $60 for cable. Back then, the general cost of goods and services aren&amp;#39;t anywhere like it is today due to inflation&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People will always pay for entertainment, so Netflix paid sharing impact on subscriber growth was always going to temporary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netflix has entered into the advertising business and so far it is proving to be successful. Consumers are benefitting because of lower price points, Netflix is benefiting because of increased subscriber growth and the advertising segment has better margins.&lt;br/&gt;
How did I calculate Free Cash Flow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix pays a substantial amount each year for content and it is hard to determine what portion of that content spend is considered maintenance capital expenditure and what portion is considered growth capital expenditure. To make this process easy, I have calculated free cash flow by taking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash Flow from operations + Additions to Content Assets - Amortization of content Assets - Purchases of Property &amp;amp; Equipment = Free Cash Flow.&lt;br/&gt;
I also believe that this is a conservative estimate of Free Cash Flow because amortisation is on an accelerated basis. Over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is amortised within 4 years after it first becomes available. There are tax laws preventing management from speeding up depreciation of tangible property but since intangible assets such as content is extremely difficult to measure, management can speed up the amortization process. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Management is incentivised to do this because a higher amortization expense (which is a non-cash expense) reduces the amount of taxes Netflix has to pay!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY PRICE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far in the post then congratulations. My buy price ranges from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;$182 to around $250&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I have used the discount cash flow calculator using the current year free cash flow (2022). The former assumes a growth rate of 15% with a 15% discount rate. The latter assumes a growth rate of 10% with a 10% discount rate. I missed out on a bargain last year but I only began looking into Netflix a few weeks ago.&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll end this analysis with this quote.&lt;br/&gt;

Right now uber drivers make 25-35 an hr on average in SF.

With tesla, they'll probably charge half that,  so let's say 15$ an hr.

If tesla takes a 50% cut, that's 7.50 an hr, let's say they operate for 12 hrs a day


Well go with Roughly 10,000 teslas roaming around SF giving rides 

10,000 teslas giving rides for 12hrs a day at 7.50 an hr equates to about 

300 mill in a year Roughly in net profit. Not bad for 1 city.



At that rate it's most likely going well,  so it'll be approved slowly around the country, so maybe 50 cities 

Multiply 300 mil by 50, you have 16 bil in net profit which should raise marketcap by 160 to 300 bil

Oh and uber will most likely be doomed in the process as this is pretty much their core business.


This is a rough guess and estimate , tesla might change the numbers around in terms of profit sharing

742,stocks,"BP is a dividend-growing stock that is moving towards renewable energy while continuing to produce oil and gas. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the pandemic have affected the company's fundamentals, but they are stabilising and exhibiting growth potential. Due to its low valuation and strong dividend and buyback programme, BP makes an appealing investment. 

  
Although the corporation recognises that renewable energy sources hold great promise for the future of energy, it also takes advantage of business opportunities in the oil and gas industry. The corporation invests substantially in LNG (liquified natural gas), one of the most significant potential, and it will gain more notoriety as Europe stops importing natural gas from Russian pipelines. As Europe switches to renewable energy, BP can support the continent's gas demand.  
Across the board, BP is significantly investing in renewable energy. For customers waiting for their autos, it makes investments in EV (electric vehicle) charging stations and convenience stores. The fuels of the future, hydrogen and biofuels, are also investments. While hydrogen is clean, primarily green hydrogen, biofuels are carbon neutral. Having access to new green fuels and charging infrastructure will put BP in a good position going forward. Electricity will be used for transportation, and hydrogen and biofuels will be used in industries.

  
A recession is a significant risk for energy industries. During recessions, expenditure declines, which lowers demand for fuel and energy. Now that the economy must deal with rising rates, which decrease investments and spending, there is a possibility of a slump. The EPS of BP will be adversely impacted in the near and medium term if the world experiences a recession.  
The oil and gas sector, which makes up the majority of BP, will remain unchanged over the next few decades. The business also hopes to expand by making investments in brand-new areas related to renewable energy and green electricity. The corporation doesn't have the same advantage it does in oil and gas because it lacks knowledge in these areas.

The QQQ and the SPY are equal for the most part except that the QQQ has a higher weighting of tech while the SPY has oil and gas, banks, and various other non tech sectors.

The strongest sector last week was probably oil and gas. Look at XLE, USO, DBC, etc. All were up.

The last time there was a rollover in the QQQ vs SPY ratio was after the August 2022 top. It didn't go back up until after the bottom in December. The one prior to that was the rollover at the end of 2021. 

The entire market is not melting down. The oil and gas sector is bullish. The VIX is tame. Treasury yields are rising. Crypto just tanked. Big tech retail favorites are getting hit. This is more like the beginning of 2022. Not the beginning of 2023. GDP estimates are freaking 5.8% for the 3rd quarter. Headline CPI has bottomed. Energy CPI is going back up.

755,stocks,"What most people do not realize is that the majority of the major studies are owned by larger entities that do not suffer from this. Sure its small term pain knowing that certain projects are on hold. There is a lot of content in the coffers that they can still continue to produce without additional writing.

Most of the major studios also have other revenue streams that power them through. Let's just take Disney to start. They have $8.3B coming in from parks. They have $5.5B coming in from Streaming. They have 1.9 Billion coming in from cord deals.

Look at Comcast, they have Peacock streamers, they have their existing cable business, they have their internet business (mixed with cable subscribers), they have their mobile unit.. they have plenty to keep powering their way through.

Then you have weird companies like Apple and Amazon who can take virtual losses forever in entertainment and not care. Netflix is weird because of all its custom content but has a massive catalog of back content to keep subscribers happy for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

What stocks to look at are the ones that rely only on content to stay alive. Those are the companies to be paying attention too. For instance I'd be very interested in how Warner Bro's/Discovery are going to be doing.  I'd also look at Sony who owes a lot to their entertainment divisions for profits (sure they do electronics and niche other areas), but they own some of the larger studios.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't want to make this a political topic but the Writers guild really needs to re-think their leverage. Sure the major studio's wont have new content coming out and already put a massive backlog and delays to projects. The major studios now are conglomerates that own so many other businesses they can keep moving along. They also don't realize that these studios will keep generating revenue but don't have to pay any of the writers, actors, production, etc... they have a freeze on money coming in but also a freeze on money going out.  The problem with industry consolidation + multi-faceted businesses is you lose your negotiating leverage.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear other peoples thoughts on this. What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

Especially their fear of AI As they know will becoming after their jobs. Netflix already was using it to determine what  shows and themes would be the most productive for returns. Disney/ILM started using it to replace opening credits. Disney even hired the group that for the end of Mando Season 2 were Luke showed up, another group of people showed they could do a better Deep Fake and they hired them. If I'm not mistaken Netflix used AI to write one of black mirrors episodes.

AI is coming and I can see why writers are so fearful. People are so naive on the idea that AI is coming for jobs even creative.

&amp;#x200B;

If anything I'd love to hear from people some of the VFX studios if they are public? That would be were I would start putting money into. Ones that are progressive and have a massive catalogue. It sucks ILM is private (Disney owned), Pixar (Disney Owned), Dreamworks, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish Epic which powers the majority of games but also the Volume that is used in almost all new TV productions.... was public but they are private for now.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

ENERGY TRANSFER TO ACQUIRE CRESTWOOD IN A $7.1 BILLION ALL-EQUITY TRANSACTION 08/16/2023 DALLAS &amp; HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET) (“Energy Transfer”) and Crestwood Equity Partners LP (NYSE: CEQP) (“Crestwood”) announced today that the parties have entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Energy Transfer will acquire Crestwood in an all-equity transaction valued at approximately $7.1 billion, including the assumption of $3.3 billion of debt, based on the closing price on August 15, 2023.

Under the terms of the agreement, Crestwood common unitholders will receive 2.07 Energy Transfer common units for each Crestwood common unit. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023, subject to the approval of Crestwood’s unitholders, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. Upon closing, Crestwood common unitholders are expected to own approximately 6.5% of Energy Transfer’s outstanding common units.

Complementary Assets

Crestwood’s system includes gathering and processing assets located in the Williston, Delaware and Powder River basins, including approximately 2.0 billion cubic feet per day of gas gathering capacity, 1.4 billion cubic feet per day of gas processing capacity and 340 thousand barrels per day of crude gathering capacity. If consummated, this transaction would extend Energy Transfer’s position in the value chain deeper into the Williston and Delaware basins while also providing entry into the Powder River basin. These assets are expected to complement Energy Transfer’s downstream fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu, as well as its hydrocarbon export capabilities from both its Nederland Terminal in Texas and the Marcus Hook Terminal in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

This transaction is also expected to provide benefits to Energy Transfer’s NGL &amp; Refined Products and Crude Oil businesses with the addition of strategically located storage and terminal assets, including approximately 10 million barrels of storage capacity, as well as trucking and rail terminals. These systems are anchored by predominantly investment-grade producer customers with firm, long-term contracts, and significant acreage dedications.

Positive Financial Impact

The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to distributable cash flow per unit as well as neutral to Energy Transfer’s leverage metrics upon closing. Similar to Energy Transfer, Crestwood’s cash flows are supported by primarily fee-based revenues from long-term contracts with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, with the increased scale and strengthened balance sheet, Energy Transfer expects to be able to improve on the current cost of financing for the acquired debt securities. Structured as a 100% unit-for-unit exchange, the transaction is tax-efficient to Crestwood unitholders and is anticipated to position both partnerships for long-term value upside through the combination.

Energy Transfer also expects to achieve at least $40 million of annual run-rate cost synergies before additional benefits of financial and commercial opportunities.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.crestwoodlp.com/investors/news/news-details/2023/Energy-Transfer-to-Acquire-Crestwood-in-a-7.1-Billion-All-Equity-Transaction/default.aspx""&gt;ENERGY TRANSFER TO ACQUIRE CRESTWOOD IN A $7.1 BILLION ALL-EQUITY TRANSACTION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm asking so many questions because you bears are the apparent winners here.

Now I realize that the FED is steamrolling inflation to 2% and they're hell bent on achieving that sooner than later, so companies won't be borrowing at these high costs anymore and growth will slow.

[S&amp;P 500 Earnings by Month](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-earnings/table/by-month) was Dec 2021 @ 216.54 and now it's Mar 2023 @ 177.07 which we haven't seen since Jun 2021 **when QQQ was $358 and now it's $362.52 today.**

So stocks most likely will correct too, I see QQQ going lower to like $330 or even $300 in an over correction.

Hai Di Lao is the most popular hotpot restaurant in China and most of Asia. It's known for the extraordinary customer service and extremely cordial atmosphere. However, it may be tough to continue achieving the impressive Y/Y growth that HDL is used to due to a few reasons such as lack of clear management guidance, tough margins and the nature of the business.  


# Investment Thesis 1:

***Lack of Clear Management Guidance***  


Due to Covid-19, HDL's management had to strategically close down stores. Management recognizes the need to be more conservative and has laid out the ""Woodpecker"" plan. The plan is to close business that (1) have low customer traffic due to a lack of established business district, (2) Unsatisfactory performance (3) Areas with high HDL density.   
But beyond this plan, management did not lay out any other plans going forward. This opacity makes it hard to maintain confidence in management and whether they are steering the ship in the right direction or into an ice berg. With their earnings report usually laying out very vague plans on using technology to enhance the experience for customers or describing R&amp;D with very low barriers to entry.  


# Investment Thesis 2:

***Tough Margins***  


The Unique Selling Point (USP) for HDL may turn out to be a double edged sword. With very strong economic incentive to motivate employees, the margins for HDL may be significantly lower than other restaurants. This problem is temporarily buoyed by the weak housing market in China that allows HDL to buff their margins with very cheap rent. However, the areas for HDL to shave margins are low. This means that HDL's only other way of improving margins is to improve revenue through charging an even larger premium. However, I'm skeptical of whether HDL is able to do that or not as HDL is still a restaurant chain it is not an established restaurant that can command a very high premium.  


# Investment Thesis 3:

***Nature of  the Business***  


HDL's business model is that they would have a very interactive waiting areas e.g. Customers can fold paper cranes while waiting for their table to reduce their final bill. The longer the customers wait, the hungrier they get and the more food they will order. However, this also means that opening up restaurant has negative within firm externality. Customers could choose to simply head to another nearby outlet which is less crowded, which means that opening new restaurants may yield declining ROIC overtime. With the strong 996 culture in China, it may also mean that the restaurant business becomes less viable as customers have lesser time and patience for Hot Pot.   
The room for innovation in the hot pot restaurant isn't a lot and this lack of innovation may severely limit the potential margins for HDL.  


# Revenue:

I've assumed that HDL will carry out its Woodpecker plan for 2 years before proceeding back into growth mode for 5 years before slowing its pace of growth. Revenue/Restaurant will also increase as I assume that due to HDL closing down less effective stores and gaining even more brand goodwill the prices it can charge will increase as well.   


Forecasting number of restaurants to be opened, I followed historic Y/Y trends and overall had a CAGR of restaurants opened at 3%.

Forecasting Revenue/Restaurant, given that less effective restaurants are shuttered I’d assume that revenue/restaurant increases back to 2021 level by the end of the woodpecker plan before decreasing in the expansion years. And in perpetuity holding at higher than pre covid levels.  


Delivery pegged as a %restaurants, rationale being that as the business performs well the goodwill of HDL will carry, improving customer loyalty. Even though more restaurants may mean more convenience to just eat at the restaurant, due to China’s 996 culture it may not be a feasible option, so I purely consider this under the rationale of HDL’s goodwill improving.  
  
Same with the sale of condiments, the main reason for condiments to be sold is because of the strong goodwill for HDL and consumer’s trust in the quality of HDL so I’ve opted for less granularity. (You don’t see HDL advertising their condiments, and mainly sell in their own HDL stores, not supermarkets.)  


Revenue Model: \[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/VK6DiuU)\]  


# COST:

**RENT EXPENSE**  
Rent is significantly cheaper now than 2018 levels because of a myriad of reasons (1) During the property craze before China's 3 red lines was established there was a large influx of funds for property ([SOURCE](http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/PressRelease/202001/t20200119_1723643.html)) leading to supply of properties to increase drastically. (2) The collapse of Evergrande led to demand for property investment cooling off.   
I’d argue that this depressed rent cannot last forever, given that Rent Expense as a % of revenue went from 4% in 2018 to 0.9% in 2022. I’d assume that amount will bounce back to about 2.5%. However, that timing may take a very long while as defaulted property developers have to finish their development and it takes time to rebuild confidence. So I’d assume it takes about 10 years to bounce back to 2.5%.  
  
**STAFF COST &amp; RAW MATERIAL**  
From 2019 - 2021, as HDL was aggressively growing they did not manage their variable cost effectively so their Staff Cost &amp; Raw Material as a % of Revenue started ballooning. I believe at the end of the “woodpecker” plan these costs as a % of Revenue will drop back down to 2018 levels as HDL more effectively manages these costs. During the expansion plan, these costs will balloon back up to 2021 levels before dropping back down to even lower than 2018 as HDL now enjoys a significant amount of Economies of Scale.  
  
**OTHERS**  
Assumed to be a %revenue and opted for less granularity, forecasting it based on historical trends.

# WACC:

ERP = Unable to find any reliable analyst’s forecast for ERP, the next best alternative is to take US stable market ERP + Adding in china’s currency default risk.  
ERP = 6.48% + 1.07%  = 7.55%  
Beta (SOURCE) = 0.73  
COE = 7.13%  
  
**Cost of Debt**  
A+ Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 5.47%  
Tax Rate = 25%  
COD = 4.10%  


**Weightage**

Shares Outstanding = 5415M

Market Value of Liability = 8850M  
  
%Liability = 0.07%

WACC = 7.37%  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

1. Tax Rate at 25% for my entire forecast.
2. There is no Cannibalistic Externality for opening up new restaurants.
3. ""Woodpecker"" Plan lasts for 2 Years and HDL will expand for 5 Years.
4. Change in NWC will follow historic trend. NWC schedule \[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/adwefK2)\]

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, I value HDL at RMB$12.55. I believe that my valuation differing from market's valuation could potentially be due to the opacity in Management's future plans. The Market may be more optimistic in how long they believe ""Woodpecker"" plan will last for and how high the growth of HDL can be. The optimism could also stem from the belief that Hot Pot will become more popular in other parts of the world, this international expansion was one aspect which I did not consider in my DCF.

The optimism could also stem from the belief that Hot Pot will become more popular in other parts of the world, this international expansion was one aspect which I did not consider in my DCF.  &lt;/p&gt;

796,stocks,"Longer DD with many numbers, all data from 10-Qs for Q2 2023 or 2022

 Interest Income increases its share of total revenue, given large portfolio expansions (+33% loan principal, +108% interest bearing assets), slightly higher NII. Non-interest income, however, seems more organically grown. Except the line “Loan origination and sales” (used to be 43% of net revenue in H1 2022, of which 70%), which captures fair value adjustments of loans originated or held in the relevant period, as well as gains on sales. In H1 2023, Gains on sales were aggregate $6.34m, while on page 17 cumulative fair value adjustments were shown as $260m (difference in cumulated fair value adjustments Dec-22, Jun-23) in the same period. There is another table on p 35, which indicates that impact on earnings of those adjustments were also captured in “interest income” and others were $91m for loans and $115m in total for the same period. These numbers don’t add up – where does the rest come from? Interestingly, despite way higher sales volume in 2022, gains were actually down quite a bit, despite them suffering some losses selling home loans in 22.

**Business Model problems:**

A large part of SoFis valuation is the unplanned high interest income, which is generated by forcefully holding loans for longer terms on the balance sheet (sales volume plummeted 86% yoy). The high percentage of charge-offs (3% on personal loans (1.25% in 2022) and 18% for credit cards (11.4% in 2022)) shows that underlying loan quality can’t possibly be that great. Most likely, those unsecured loans were advanced for refinancing (credit cards, pay now pay later, etc.) debt which very well can become toxic should financial conditions continue to tighten or economic conditions to start shifting. BAC’s credit card segment shows &lt;1% charge-off rates on 10.68% yield, which is bizarrely lower than SoFi’s personal loans. For comparison, BAC’s yield on personal/consumer loans was a mere 4.35% in H1 2023. Given those circumstances, one might wonder how shitty those loans actually are…

  
 What’s more, the market currently thinks that the re-commencement of student loan repayments is going to boost SoFi’s business, as many previously federal borrowers are going to refi with them. Just two problems; first, SoFi currently earns on average 4.93% interest on student loans. Given that SOFR and now 2yr treasuries are already at 5%, this should mean that fair value adjustments of student loans should actually be negative, when they aren't on their balance sheet. Compare that to SLM, which charges 7% on federally backed loans, and 10%+ on average on private loans (Maybe SoFi's loan quality is better or the originated more during pandemic years, but they hardly offer any data on their borrowers - which SLM does). Moreover, SoFi leverages approximately half its student loans via warehousing at a 564-691 bps rate, which does not make sense whatsoever. The only explanation is, that they have a very segregated portfolio of highly yielding (prop. 9%+) risky loans and a few high-quality low yielding ones, otherwise back-leveraging does not really make sense at higher borrowing costs than yields. Noted, that they’ve reduced their drawable commitment and got that facility probably in 0% SOFR times. But even if assumed, that the other half is funded by deposits costing 3.8-4.6 %, they really don’t make any money. Looking ahead, funding costs (warehouse and deposits) are likely to keep increasing at least for a year, while chargeable interest rates on student loans will be effectively capped by a 5.5% federal rate for eligible people. One might argue, ""Well what about falling rates, having loans yielding 4.9% is then really good"", well they're all going to refinance, same old problem back when we had wonderful CDOs etc.

What‘s your thoughts on this - currently have no exposure, because I don‘t really know whether the above is actually valid.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer DD with many numbers, all data from 10-Qs for Q2 2023 or 2022&lt;/p&gt;

798,stocks,"Bitcoin have recovered substantially from the precipitous drop seen last year as a result of rising interest rates, macroeconomic pressures, and the failure of FTX and other mining enterprises. While regulatory worries and extreme volatility continue to make equities dangerous, numerous analysts remain optimistic about the market. Comparison Toolsa are used to compare Coinbase Global ($COIN), Marathon Digital ($MARA), and Riot Platforms ($RIOT) to determine the most appealing mining stock.

# Coinbase Global ($COIN):

Coinbase Global has faced increased regulatory scrutiny, with the SEC suing the company for selling unregistered securities. Despite these issues, Coinbase shares have rallied by 128% this year. The company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, with revenue declining 12.4% to $708 million, but exceeding analysts' expectations. The loss per share narrowed to $0.42, better than analysts' expectation of $0.76. Lower costs and a surge in interest income contributed to the bottom line. However, investors were disappointed with the sequential decline in Q2 2023 trading volumes and the company's Q3 2023 guidance for subscriptions and services. Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley raised his price target for Coinbase to $80, maintaining a Hold rating. Wall Street is sidelined on COIN stock, with a Hold consensus rating based on six Buys, eight Holds, and eight Sells. The average price target of $80.68 suggests the stock could be range bound from current levels.

# Marathon Digital Holdings ($MARA):

Marathon Digital reported a Q2 2023 revenue surge of $81.8 million, driven by a 314% increase in Bitcoin production. This growth narrowed the reported loss per share to $0.13 from $1.94 in the previous quarter. However, the company also highlighted impressive growth in its hash rate and efficiency, with a 54% increase to 17.7 Exahashes per second (EH/s) in Q2 2023 compared to the first quarter. The company is targeting an operational hash rate of 23 EH/s through its new facilities in Ellendale, North Dakota and Garden City, Texas. Compass Point analyst Chase White reduced his price target for Marathon Digital to $20 from $21 and reiterated a Buy rating. With two Buys and two Holds, Marathon Digital scores a Moderate Buy consensus rating, with an average price target of $16.50, implying a 10% upside. Shares have jumped over 338% year-to-date.

# Riot Platforms ($RIOT):

Riot Platforms, a major Bitcoin miner in North America, has seen a strong rebound from last year's slump due to Bitcoin price increases and its expansion. The company reported mixed results for Q2 2023, with a lower-than-anticipated loss per share and a 27% increase in Bitcoin production. Roth MKM analyst Darren Aftahi reiterated a Buy rating on RIOT stock and raised the price target to $19.50. The company's Q2 2023 results showed a 19% reduction in mining costs and $13.5 million in power credits, which could improve efficiency in the second half of the year. Aftahi believes Riot Platforms has the potential to triple its hash rate from 10.7 EH/s to 35 EH/s by the end of 2025. The stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on eight unanimous Buys, with an average price target of $20.19, indicating 38% upside potential. Shares have risen over 332% since the start of this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Wall Street is positive on Riot Platforms but bearish on Coinbase and cautiously hopeful on Marathon Digital. Despite a great year-to-date performance, experts expect Riot Platforms stock to rise much more. Nonetheless, before making any investing decisions, investors should examine the significant risks and volatility connected with equities.

Wall Street is sidelined on COIN stock, with a Hold consensus rating based on six Buys, eight Holds, and eight Sells. The average price target of $80.68 suggests the stock could be range bound from current levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Marathon Digital Holdings ($MARA):&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marathon Digital reported a Q2 2023 revenue surge of $81.8 million, driven by a 314% increase in Bitcoin production. This growth narrowed the reported loss per share to $0.13 from $1.94 in the previous quarter. However, the company also highlighted impressive growth in its hash rate and efficiency, with a 54% increase to 17.7 Exahashes per second (EH/s) in Q2 2023 compared to the first quarter. The company is targeting an operational hash rate of 23 EH/s through its new facilities in Ellendale, North Dakota and Garden City, Texas. Compass Point analyst Chase White reduced his price target for Marathon Digital to $20 from $21 and reiterated a Buy rating. With two Buys and two Holds, Marathon Digital scores a Moderate Buy consensus rating, with an average price target of $16.50, implying a 10% upside. Shares have jumped over 338% year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Riot Platforms ($RIOT):&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riot Platforms, a major Bitcoin miner in North America, has seen a strong rebound from last year&amp;#39;s slump due to Bitcoin price increases and its expansion. The company reported mixed results for Q2 2023, with a lower-than-anticipated loss per share and a 27% increase in Bitcoin production. Roth MKM analyst Darren Aftahi reiterated a Buy rating on RIOT stock and raised the price target to $19.50. The company&amp;#39;s Q2 2023 results showed a 19% reduction in mining costs and $13.5 million in power credits, which could improve efficiency in the second half of the year. Aftahi believes Riot Platforms has the potential to triple its hash rate from 10.7 EH/s to 35 EH/s by the end of 2025. The stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on eight unanimous Buys, with an average price target of $20.19, indicating 38% upside potential. Shares have risen over 332% since the start of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is positive on Riot Platforms but bearish on Coinbase and cautiously hopeful on Marathon Digital. Despite a great year-to-date performance, experts expect Riot Platforms stock to rise much more. Nonetheless, before making any investing decisions, investors should examine the significant risks and volatility connected with equities.&lt;/p&gt;

809,stocks,"Hi,

I'm looking at ASML at a potential stock and try to find a fair value to see if the current price is undervalued or overvalued.

Based on its Free Cash Flow (FCF) between 2014-2022, I obtain a CARGO of around 30%, and an average growth of 45%. As per finviz estimates an EPS growth of around 20% over the next 5 years.

Considering a growth rate of 18% over the next 10 years, a discount (WAAC) rate of 10%, I obtain a fair value $700, so its current price of $660 means it is undervalued.

However, I mean I remember that ASML stated that they expect some headwinds for the rest of the year, so I'm considering to DCA into the stock when it hits around $630.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious to know your  thoughts on the stock, and at what price you seem to be tempted to enter a position.

Consumer spending held up well in July as inflation slowed, with retail sales turning in a stronger than expected showing for the month, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.  
  
The advanced retail sales report showed a seasonally adjusted increase of 0.7% for the month, better than the 0.4% Dow Jones estimate. Excluding autos, sales rose a robust 1%, also against a 0.4% forecast. Both readings were the best monthly gains since January.  
  
As the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, they showed a consumer able to keep ahead of price increases that have been prevalent over the past two years. The consumer price index rose 0.2% on the month, indicating solid demand.  
  
July’s numbers were boosted by a 1.9% jump in spending at online retailers, while sporting goods and related stores increased 1.5% and food service and drinking places rose 1.4%.  
  
On the downside, furniture sales slumped 1.8% and electronics and appliance stores reported a 1.3% drop. Gas station sales rose just 0.4% on the month despite rising prices at the pump.  
  
The report adds to the narrative that the U.S. economy may be able to avoid a much-predicted recession brought on by a series of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes aimed at controlling inflation.  
  
In a series of 11 increases since March 2022, the central bank has taken up its key borrowing rate by 5.25 percentage points to hits highest level in more than 22 years. Regardless, consumers, who power about two-thirds of the entire $26.8 trillion U.S. economy, have persevered.  
  
As saving has begun to dry up, shoppers have shown a willingness to use credit cards, the balances of which exceeded $1 trillion for the first time in the second quarter of 2023.  
  
July’s data showed that spending was widespread, with most categories showing increases. However, motor vehicle sales fell 0.3% as well. On a 12-month basis, sales rose 3.2%, which is exactly in line with the annual increase in the CPI.  
  
A separate report Tuesday, however, showed that inflation pressures linger after hitting their highest level in more than 40 years in the summer of 2022.  
  
Import prices move 0.4% higher in July, higher than the 0.2% estimate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was only the second monthly gain in 2023, as the year-over-year rate declined 4.4%. A year ago, the annual increase was 8.8%.  
  
Virtually all of the increase came from a 3.6% rise in imported fuel prices. Import prices were unchanged when excluding fuel, according to the BLS.  
  
Export prices, though, rose even more, gaining 0.7% on the month. However, they are down 7.9% from a year ago, after surging 12.9% from July 2021 to July 2022.  
  
An additional report Tuesday presented another mixed bag of data.  
  
The Empire State Manufacturing Survey, which gauges activity in the New York region, slumped 20 points in August to a reading of -19. That represents the difference between companies reporting expansion against contraction, and was much lower than the -1.4 Dow Jones estimate.  
  
New orders and shipments dropped sharply on the month, while prices paid and received both moved considerably higher.  
  
Despite the poor August reading, the index for future business conditions, which measures expectations six months out, increased to 19.9, a move up of 6 points. That came as new orders and shipments, the big drag in the current conditions survey, to “increase significantly,” while employment is “expected to grow considerably.”  
  
Capital spending expectations also rose sharply.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/retail-sales-report-july-2023.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/retail-sales-report-july-2023.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A Fitch Ratings analyst warned that the U.S. banking industry has inched closer to another source of turbulence — the risk of sweeping rating downgrades on dozens of U.S. banks that could even include the likes of JPMorgan Chase. The ratings agency cut its assessment of the industry’s health in June, a move that analyst Chris Wolfe said went largely unnoticed because it didn’t trigger downgrades on banks. But another one-notch downgrade of the industry’s score, to A+ from AA-, would force Fitch to reevaluate ratings on each of the more than 70 U.S. banks it covers, Wolfe told CNBC in an exclusive interview at the firm’s New York headquarters. “If we were to move it to A+, then that would recalibrate all our financial measures and would probably translate into negative rating actions,” Wolfe said.

The credit rating firms relied upon by bond investors have roiled markets lately with their actions. Last week, Moody’s downgraded 10 small and midsized banks and warned that cuts could come for another 17 lenders, including larger institutions like Truist and U.S. Bank. Earlier this month, Fitch downgraded the U.S. long-term credit rating because of political dysfunction and growing debt loads, a move that was derided by business leaders including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. This time, Fitch is intent on signaling to the market that bank downgrades, while not a foregone conclusion, are a real risk, said Wolfe. The firm’s June action took the industry’s “operating environment” score to AA- from AA because of pressure on the country’s credit rating, regulatory gaps exposed by the March regional bank failures and uncertainty around interest rates.

The problem created by another downgrade to A+ is that the industry’s score would then be lower than some of its top-rated lenders. The country’s two largest banks by assets, JPMorgan and Bank of America, would likely be cut to A+ from AA- in this scenario, since banks can’t be rated higher than the environment in which they operate. And if top institutions like JPMorgan are cut, then Fitch would be forced to at least consider downgrades on all their peers’ ratings, according to Wolfe. That could potentially push some weaker lenders closer to non-investment-grade status.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/fitch-warns-it-may-be-forced-to-downgrade-dozens-of-banks.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/fitch-warns-it-may-be-forced-to-downgrade-dozens-of-banks.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So what do you all think. Hoping for some healthy debate on this one.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indi semiconductor is an automotive focused semiconductor company. I’ve bought and sold Indi a few times mostly for profit but have been impressed with their leaderships vision and consistency in their financial estimates delivering. I work in the semiconductor industry so I was originally drawn to them knowing that automotive semi margins are pretty good. They reported earnings last week and their predictions for the last 2 years are coming to fruition. They will be profitable in the next two quarters and I’ve started to layer in but was curious on all of your thoughts. My thought is that next quarter when they meet or exceed expectations and then have profitability at their fingertips ie continue to guide for profitability next quarter that the stock will start to run based on the consistency of their estimates. The main highlights from this quarter are;&lt;/p&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

821,stocks,"&gt;***""I’ve been told I am crazy to raise member expectations this high as we head into bargaining,"" Fain said in his address. ""I refuse to allow employers, the billionaire class, and sellouts to play on our fears.""***

UAW president Shawn Fain raised some eyebrows during a Facebook Live video address in early August to the union faithful.

In an hour-long talk, Fain, a 20-year UAW veteran and a former shop chair at Stellantis' Kokomo, Indiana, plant, told members what he had planned for the Big Three automakers — GM (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLA), formerly Chrysler — for this year's contract negotiations. The bottom line was this: After all the sacrifices the UAW made over the years, the days of rolling over were done. The bill was due.

The stakes couldn't be higher for the UAW and the Big Three.

The current contract ends on September 14, at which point a work stoppage could occur if they don't strike a deal. The negotiations, if Fain's speech was any indication, will be the most contentious in recent memory. Why? Fain and current UAW leadership believe the union has given up too much in the past.

The increased rancor has already made a mark. Shares of GM, Ford, and Stellantis all dropped steeply last week, largely because Wall Street is concerned that a work stoppage would seriously impact automakers as they navigate a generational and costly electric transformation.

'These demands aren’t going to happen'

**The demands set out by Fain and UAW leadership include ""substantial wage increases,"" which amount to a 46% rise over three years; eliminating compensation tiers for new and old workers (which the UPS Teamsters secured); restoring cost of living adjustments; providing a new pension plan; and reducing work weeks to 32 hours from the standard 40.**

Making such demands in public ahead of contract talks isn't typical for the UAW and the Big Three automakers.

In the past, the UAW and Big Three went behind closed doors to negotiate after a contract was hammered out. The UAW then presented the proposed contract to its members for a vote.

Publicly releasing contract demands could backfire for the union, putting pressure on the leadership to avoid compromise and therefore up the likelihood of an impasse with the Big Three negotiators.

**But the tough-guy talk may be a plus: Fain, in essence, may be preparing the rank and file for a long, rough fight — a fight brought on by the costs facing the Big Three given these demands. According to Bloomberg, the cost of the UAW demands could amount to $80 billion over the course of the contract, which typically lasts three to four years.**

Fain's demands caught the automakers' leadership off guard.

""Everyone understands these demands aren’t going to happen — it would be suicidal for the companies to agree to this,"" one industry source told Yahoo Finance.

The UAW's wish list would amount to $25 billion-$30 billion per automaker over the life of the contract.

**""That adds $35 to $40 per hour to active labor cost — an increase of roughly 60%,"" the source said. The impact being that automakers would return to the ""bankruptcy era"" and more than double the labor costs for GM, Ford, and Stellantis versus non-union automakers like Tesla (TSLA).**

When reached for comment, a UAW spokesperson noted the industry source's take misrepresented a few key points.

""The Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor estimates that labor is just 5.1% of the cost of the average vehicle. That's a very important data point to take into account when the automakers claim that our demands will be catastrophic,"" UAW spokesperson Jim McNeil said.

McNeil also noted that the rising MSRPs of Big Three vehicles have not been driven by labor. ""[A recent study] published by the BLS shows that dealer markups have been driving up the costs of new cars, NOT labor costs.""

Finally, McNeil pointed to a recent statement made by Fain talking about the costs borne by UAW workers over the past decade and a half.

""Overall, the starting pay for a Big Three worker today is almost $21,000 less than it was in 2007 when adjusted for inflation,"" the statement said. ""UAW members made enormous sacrifices to save the automakers during the Great Recession, but we’ve never been made whole.""

A 'good faith' process

For its part, Big Three leadership has been striking more of a conciliatory tone, at least publicly.

GM President Mark Reuss recently told Yahoo Finance that GM is negotiating a deal ""that works for everybody in good faith.”

Meanwhile, Ford Chairman Bill Ford has said that the UAW isn’t the ""enemy"" and that he wants to find common ground.

But Stellantis, which just this week saw Fain throw its contract proposal into the trash in another Facebook Live video, said the UAW needs to focus on ""reality.""

""[The UAW] demands could endanger our ability to make decisions in the future that provide job security for our employees,"" Stellantis North America COO Mark Stewart said in a statement to employees, according to Reuters. ""This is a losing proposition for all of us.""
Wall Street wary

Wall Street, it seems, is anticipating the worst.

Last week CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson double-downgraded GM to Strong Sell and slashed his price target to $28 from $40. Nelson wrote in a client note, ""the growing risk of a UAW strike, given reports that the company and union remain extremely far apart in labor negotiations ... [and] newly-elected UAW President Shawn Fain appears to be aggressive and eager to make his mark with the Detroit Three.""

Nelson also said that the last UAW strike in 2019, which lasted 40 days, impacted GM’s earnings by $1.89 a share.

Morningstar automotive analyst David Whiston echoed those concerns, particularly for GM and Ford, which are more tied to the UAW compared to Stellantis, which has a bigger international labor presence.

""GM and Ford may be in the penalty box for a while. Wall Street hates uncertainty,"" Whiston said. ""This is not a normal negotiation, both in style and the demands they are asking.""

""This is a different time,"" longtime Detroit Free Press automotive writer Eric Lawrence told Yahoo Finance.

**""The union is talking in terms that they probably haven't talked in a long time. They've kind of come out swinging. They've kind of put the automakers on notice, and they've told the workers that they expect to fight for a lot of this contract.""**

Japan’s economy posted its third straight quarterly expansion, provisional government data showed Tuesday, as robust export growth contributed to an annualized 6% expansion in the second quarter, handily beating market expectations.

Economist surveyed by Reuters had expected the world’s third-largest economy to post 3.1% growth in the April-June quarter. The impressive gross domestic product data translated to a more modest quarterly expansion of 1.5%, topping expectations for 0.8% growth.

The benchmark Nikkei 225 index extended gains slightly to trade up nearly 1%, while the Japanese yen pared losses against the U.S. dollar and Japanese government bonds across the various tenures were broadly unchanged.

Tuesday’s GDP print pointed to a continued post-Covid recovery for Japan’s economy. Still, this narrower gap between reality and expectation in quarterly growth tempers any longer-term optimism.

“Japan’s economy expanded at an extremely rapid pace last quarter, but we expect a renewed slowdown across the second half of the year,” Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.

“However, the details of the report weren’t as impressive as the headline,” he added. “Instead, nearly all of the increase in output was driven by a 1.8%-pts boost from net trade. That marked the second-largest contribution from net trade in the 28-year history of the current GDP series, with only the bounce back in exports from the first lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic providing a larger boost.”

Exports rebounded 3.2% from the previous quarter — largely driven by the spike in car shipments — while imports plunged 4.3% over the time period.

Other details beyond the rosy headline GDP growth figure suggest the Bank of Japan is likely to revert from its ultra-easy monetary posture.

A surprise 0.5% annualized drop in private consumption expenditure, along with muted capital expenditure pointing to muted domestic demand despite the first employee compensation sequential increase in seven quarters.

This comes as inflation has exceeded the BOJ’s 2% target for 15 consecutive months. In July, the Japanese central bank loosened its yield curve control over the 10-year Japanese government bond in a modification it says was intended to make its ultra-easy monetary position more sustainable.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/japan-q2-gdp.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/15/japan-q2-gdp.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Japan’s economy expanded at an extremely rapid pace last quarter, but we expect a renewed slowdown across the second half of the year,” Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“However, the details of the report weren’t as impressive as the headline,” he added. “Instead, nearly all of the increase in output was driven by a 1.8%-pts boost from net trade. That marked the second-largest contribution from net trade in the 28-year history of the current GDP series, with only the bounce back in exports from the first lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic providing a larger boost.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exports rebounded 3.2% from the previous quarter — largely driven by the spike in car shipments — while imports plunged 4.3% over the time period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other details beyond the rosy headline GDP growth figure suggest the Bank of Japan is likely to revert from its ultra-easy monetary posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A surprise 0.5% annualized drop in private consumption expenditure, along with muted capital expenditure pointing to muted domestic demand despite the first employee compensation sequential increase in seven quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes as inflation has exceeded the BOJ’s 2% target for 15 consecutive months. In July, the Japanese central bank loosened its yield curve control over the 10-year Japanese government bond in a modification it says was intended to make its ultra-easy monetary position more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

827,stocks,"The previously unknown partner in a $2 billion video game mega-deal that mysteriously and dramatically collapsed last spring was the Saudi government-funded Savvy Games Group, Axios has learned.

Why it matters: The fallout of the failed deal sent shares of The Embracer Group — Savvy's would-be partner, and one of the most voracious acquirers of video games studios in the last several years — plummeting, and forced it into cost-cutting mode.

More broadly, the revelation may raise questions about how Saudi Arabia will proceed with its controversial ambitions to invest $38 billion in the video game industry.

Driving the news: Axios learned of Savvy's involvement from four sources familiar with the deal who were not authorized to speak about it publicly, and after reviewing documentation related to the planned partnership.

An Embracer spokesperson declined to comment for this story. A Savvy rep did not reply by press time.

Catch up quick: The $2 billion deal would have involved Savvy investing in the development and publishing of games from Embracer, helping establish the Saudi company as a major gaming label.

Embracer had been promising investors news of a lucrative ""transformative partnership … with several industry partners"" since November 2022.

But in a May 24, 2023 note, Embracer management announced the collapse of one of those massive partnerships, while carefully avoiding naming the partner.

In the May note, Embracer said that the parties had reached a verbal commitment in October 2022 that would have resulted in more than $2 billion ""in contracted development revenue over a period of six years.""

""All documentation was finalized and ready to go as of yesterday,"" the company said. ""We asked for the execution of the agreement before our Q4 announcement. However late last night we received a negative outcome from the counterparty.""

While Axios' sources were clear about who the deal was with, they were less certain about why Savvy walked away.

Embracer and Savvy are both rising forces in the games industry, and have worked together before.

Embracer has risen to prominence in recent years through a string of acquisitions, including its May 2022 $300 million purchase of several elite studios, along with the rights to the iconic Tomb Raider gaming franchise. In August 2022, it announced a $365 million purchase for the rights to Lord of the Rings.

Savvy emerged in January 2022 with the news that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, or Public Investment Fund (PIF), was setting it up as an attempt to invest in gaming and diversify the Kingdom's economy. It immediately announced the $1.5 billion purchase of two esports firms.

The intrigue: Over the last two years, the PIF has become one of the largest shareholders in several major gaming companies, including Nintendo, Take Two Interactive and Electronic Arts.

Savvy committed to investing $38 billion in the gaming industry, and in April 2023 said it would purchase mobile gaming company Scopely for $4.9 billion.

Embracer and Savvy announced a stock deal last June, with the Saudi firm purchasing $1 billion worth of Embracer shares — a move Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors swiftly defended amid criticism that the investment would compromise his company's values.

While Savvy executives have told Axios and others that their operation, which has a board chaired by Saudi crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman, is a genuine effort to get into gaming and address the professional and leisure interests of the kingdom's youthful population, it's nonetheless been accused of being a distraction from the country's human rights record, similar to criticism of so-called ""sportswashing"" that's emerged from Saudi-backed efforts in boxing and golf.

What's next: Embracer will announce its latest quarterly earnings Thursday, when it may begin to detail cost reductions which it has promised to have in place by October 1.

Meanwhile, some Embracer divisions continue to announce new games. And Embracer still has a lucrative deal with Amazon, which committed in December to publish the next Tomb Raider game as it, too, attempts to establish itself as a player in big-budget gaming.

But some Embracer studio projects are getting canceled — and one studio, Campfire Cabal, announced last week that it was being shut down due to Embracer's restructuring.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe Walmart will take a nice sized dip this week after earnings, for the following reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

First and foremast, I'd like to compare Walmart to their direct competitor Target. Walmart is valued at 431.35B while Targets market cap is 59B (Walmart 7x Target).

&amp;#x200B;

Walmart trades at significantly higher PE ratio of 38.85 while Target is 22.29.

&amp;#x200B;

Walmart is up a whopping 22% this year, while Target has fallen 25%

&amp;#x200B;

One of the primary reasons for purchasing Walmart stock according to investors, is that it is a ""recession proof business""

&amp;#x200B;

I disagree with that point based on the fact that they already operate on absolutely razer-thin margins currently, and those will only decrease in a recessionary environment. Furthermore, shoplifting has been rapidly increasing YoY. Over 3 Billion dollars worth of products are stolen from Walmart every year. I can't imagine this will DECREASE in a recession, only INCREASE.

&amp;#x200B;

The smallest increases in shoplifting further decrease Walmarts already razer thin margin.

&amp;#x200B;

Comparing Walmart to Target may be a mute point as they are different businesses for sure. But I think this comparison shows the weakness of Walmart's hyper-thin margin business model and shows their overvaluation.

&amp;#x200B;

Second point: Ecommerce.

&amp;#x200B;

Walmarts Ecommerce division loses a significant amount of money. You will have likely notice this if you have ordered from their platform before. They will deliver same-day oftentimes, on already razer thin margin grocery items. This is a disaster for any profits. They have been trying to gain traction via 3rd party sellers on the platform, but this has not caught on at all and is mostly Chinese sellers with very high ship times.

&amp;#x200B;

Third point: Insider Selling

&amp;#x200B;

Insiders have been offloading incredible amounts of shares recently, with no purchases since March 15. They offloaded 3+ billion in shares the first half of 2023 and continued selling massive amounts of shares throughout the summer of 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

While these shares have been offloaded, the stock price has continued to rise, raising the fund &amp; retail % ownership of the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

Walmart has earnings on Thursday (8/17) and Target has earnings on Wednesday (8/16). I believe both of these earnings calls will impact Walmart share price negatively, and Target positively.

&amp;#x200B;

Weather you buy Target stock or short Walmart is up to you. But I believe this week we see a nice sized correction, shortening the gap between the two companies market cap.

PayPal's new CEO will be Alex Chriss, the executive who runs the Small Business and Self-Employed group for Intuit, members of PayPal's board announced Monday.

Chriss will take over for PayPal's long time CEO Dan Schulman beginning Sept. 27th. Schulman had previously announced a plan to step down from the role by the end of the year. He will remain a director at the company until May 2024.

PayPal's board said Chriss was chosen for the role out of a pool of nine candidates. The selection process began back in February.

Tesla is implementing significant price reductions for its vehicles in China, following a substantial 31% drop in sales for July from the previous month. To counter the downturn in the world's largest automotive market, Tesla has trimmed the starting prices of its China-made Model Y long-range and performance models by 14,000 yuan (around $1,900), a reduction of 4.5% and 3.8% respectively. Additionally, the automaker will offer insurance subsidies of 8,000 yuan for entry-level, real-wheel-drive versions of Model 3 cars, available between Aug. 14 and Sept. 30.  
  
The move comes amidst a broader global decrease in demand for electric vehicles, and local competitors such as BYD regaining market share with more favorable pricing. Sales of Tesla’s China-made cars have been on a decline since the end of 2022, although the automaker did see a 31% year-over-year increase in sales in China in February 2023.  
  
Despite the decline in China, Tesla's global vehicle deliveries in Q2 2023 hit a record high of 466,100 units, a quarter-over-quarter increase of about 10.23%. The announcement of the price cuts led to Tesla's stock falling over 3% in premarket trading, reflecting investors' concerns over the sales slowdown in a key market for the electric vehicle maker.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://tokenist.com/tesla-drops-3-after-price-cuts-announced-in-china/""&gt;https://tokenist.com/tesla-drops-3-after-price-cuts-announced-in-china/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
