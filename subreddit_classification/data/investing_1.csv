2,investing,"Hey everyone, I (25m) am finally eligible for my employer match at my company. I decided it was time to open a 401k with them, and I chose a Roth 401k rather than a Pretax 401k.

I’m looking to roll over my previous Pretax 401k funds into this Roth 401k, and understand I will need to pay taxes on the funds. It is a low amount, so I’m not very worried about this.

- Vanguard Extended Market Index (25%)
- Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index (30%)
- MFS International Value (15%)

4,investing,"This is something I’ve discussed with friends and thought about for the past few years.

TL;DR Does having more investors than ever before and faster opportunities for companies to grow account for the “outrageous multiples” we see?

I believe the average PE of the S&amp;P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don’t need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

With that in mind, I can’t help but think about the amount of new money that’s been brought in in the last 20 years as ease of access to investing, as well as financial savvy has grown. I mean look at the market cap of the US market here:

https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

Are we just in a new norm as a result of these things? I’m not saying the market isn’t overvalued but is it AS overvalued as analysts think or should we be adjusting our baselines?

6,investing,"Hi everyone. I’d love to ask some advice. I’m early 40s, based in europe. I began setting up passive income streams about 10 years ago, and have been in and out of brick and mortar businesses in that time as well. Recently got out of a restaurant…dear lord never again.

I think my story and situation are quite unique. I got unlucky a bunch of times, and got really lucky a couple of times. I don’t think I’ve been particularly responsible, just lucky, as I’ve taken huge risks, some of which panned out. Most of all the good stuff happened in the last couple of years, before then I was just building and stressing stressing stressing.

I’d love some advice on what my next steps could/should be, and why. I feel totally ‘outside’ the system and would like at least some part of my portfolio to be sensible and conventional, but I’d also like to hear about more aggressive/risky plays. I know I’m in a very fortuitous position, and I want to make sure I’m doing all I can to maximize my good fortune.

My current ‘snapshot’ is as follows. All numbers converted to USD.

----

**Monthy passive income:** 
Approximately $120-140k gross, of which maybe 20-25% is post-tax income/profit. This will run till about the end of 2025. With no changes or lateral moves, this 120-140 will go down to around 20-25 from say 2025/26 onward.

**Investments:** 

$50k in a tech startup that has unicorn potential

$15k in crypto (worth around 9k now lol)

$20-30k in other miscellaneous ventures/startups

**Assets:** 
Not a lot to speak of, just the businesses I’m currently operating/overseeing with a few new startups/projects in very early stages sprinkled in. No real estate, no property, no car. Renting a flat for a very good price. 

Approx $700k cash post-tax profit in corporate accounts. Will still need to move this into personal, but there’s a plan in place for that (low TR).

Approx $150k in cash. I know, it’s way too much to have in cash.

**Debt:** 0

**Monthly spend/burn:** $1500-2000. Yeah...I live very frugally, partly by coincidence and the rest by design.

10,investing,"Hi all,

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&amp;#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|120|5|25|
|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.

I am 33M.  

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.  

I started getting more serious and doing a lot more research in the last year or so and have accepted my losses and sold off my bad investments.  I've now invested in a mix of growth/ETFs like VOO, SCHD, AAPL, and TSLA

Lately, I just feel like the ""safest"" and more guaranteed return on investments are CDs and T-Bills given the interest rates they are offering (5% - 5.5%). I am in the process of setting up a CD/T-Bills ladder where I'd have maturing CDs or T-Bills monthly starting later this year. 

Should I continue with this approach? I know the interest rates will fluctuate and may not always be high but I haven't seen any of my investments besides TSLA really take off (AAPL has done decent). As noted above, I actually lost a good amount in the past.  

Right now, my goal is to not think about it everyday and just have my money grow over time (I will not need the cash). Should I just put it all in VOO? Leave it in SPAXX? Or just continue the ladder strategy? Are there any risks I'm not considering?

13,investing,"I saved up about a six month emergency fund which I have sitting in a money market account. But as I've started to accumulate more money in a market index fund I have been wondering if keeping any money in a money market account makes sense so long as you have enough extra in stocks. The worst that can happen is that the market goes down right when I need the emergency fund, which could certainly happen together in an economic downturn. In that case I'd essentially be paying more for using the emergency fund.

Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I'd basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. 

So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.

Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I'm not considering?

&gt;**He has the power to wipe out the entire human race. If we believe there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.**

In financial planning, this is truer than ever. So many ""30-year"" projections all make massive assumptions. That 6-months of emergency funds will be enough. That interest rates on bonds will be ""safe"" (not anymore they're not). That real-estate will appreciate. That social security will be there for you. That the government won't default etc etc.

Often, people glibly dismiss worse-case scenarios saying *""Well, if that happens, you'll have bigger things to worry about""*. No, I fucking won't! The government can default, but my first concern will be protecting my finances.

So what am I preparing for? **I don't know.** I have no idea what to prepare for.

What is my long-term horizon? I don't know

When will I retire? **I don't know**

For how long will I live? **I don't know**

How much money will I need? **I don't know**

I have no idea what will go wrong, or when.

So I thought I'll share six things I do to prepare for the worst.

**Keep $200k in Cash Equivalents**

People often recommend a ""6-month"" emergency fund. As if life's major problems will only last 6-months. What if you get disabled? What if your entire job industry vanishes, and you're unemployed for six years?

So I keep a 75/25 stock/cash portfolio allocation.

More importantly, I can't even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.

**Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only**

I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I'll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.

Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it's not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.

Always assume that you're going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.

**A Strong Value Tilt**

In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post [in defense of dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/), so I won't rehash my arguments here. I'll add only this - dividends aren't enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.

In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the [Gordon equation](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808).

**Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me**

If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don't want complications at the worst possible time.

**Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife**

A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I [posted about it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/) :) . It's not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.

But in case I'm persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can *maybe* bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.

**No House - Rent Only**

A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don't know what kind of tenants you'll get. Too much risk.

Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.

&lt;p&gt;Ossiam US Steepener Fonds (WKN: A2PKUL)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However those are EU ETF. &lt;/p&gt;

I have saved up 1000 Euros as an initial investment and plan to contribute 200 Euros per month going forward. After doing some research, I am considering investing in a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. However, I have some questions and would love to hear your thoughts and advice:

	1.	Is now a good time to step into the market, given the current economic conditions and market trends?
	2.	Considering my age and long-term investment horizon, does investing in a 2x leveraged ETF make sense, or are there other investment strategies I should consider?
	3.	Should I go 100% in on the S&amp;P 500 2x leverage ETF, or would a diversified portfolio be a better approach?

Interested to see if there is any research out there that could suggest active trading beats B&amp;H. 

I've done some small backtesting on a few hundred trades that I thought I had identified as non-random movements, and even still the win % only really comes out to about 54% with a 1:1 Risk reward ratio. 

Theoretically, that has positive expected value, however, due to randomness, and the win % not being high enough, you are basically jsut chopping around and maybe making a few % points here and there on the most likely run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Again, this was just some small testing I personally did but everything in my view doesn't really hold up to simple B&amp;H over the long run. 

With that being said, I was interested in seeing if there is research out there comparing buy and hold to active management / active trading over a large enough data set and if there is potentially above what you would normally get by just buying a Vanguard index fund. 

Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it's because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I've made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same. You are basically around break even, + or - a few % points over enough trade samples. 

I don't see how you could ever outperform B&amp;H by actively trading.

I will use the commodity NATGAS as an example which is $2.69 (01-aug.-'23) and I use Etoro as platform.  
However, the question is a general question for all platforms I suppose:  
  
I see that if eg. today I open a short (CFD, 1x) of $1000,- I get a weekly fee of $10.49 indefinitely as long as my position does not hit stop loss.  
I can move my stop loss to $14.8 if I add another $4000,- to my position.  
So using $5000 in total, I get $10.49\*52=$545 annually. This is more than 10%!!  
  
Now, I get that if the price of NATGAS rises, I am in ''trouble'', but not as long as it stays under my SL. I could even put the fees I receive back into my position increasing the SL further over time whilst maintaining the $545 annual fee.  
If I look at the history of NATGAS (known for more than 25 years) it never reached $15,-  
  
I know that results from the past are no guarantees for the future but still it feels like a solid way to get $545 annually! Why isn't everyone doing this then...

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m an adherent of the Bogleheads school of investing, which is essentially &amp;quot;since you can&amp;#39;t beat the market, buy the market&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m familiar with Buffett&amp;#39;s emphasis on long-term value, as well as the different systems of market valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just wondering if there were any other un/official schools of thought about investing in general, like what kind of philosophy a day trader would follow as opposed to someone heavily into technical analysis. I figure all the major figures (Buffett, Soros etc) would have their own &amp;quot;style&amp;quot; that people try to emulate?&lt;/p&gt;

I am mostly invested in equities and have been thinking of ways to try to diversify. Physical real estate and dealing with tenants doesn't sound that appealing to me personally.

I'll try to be in depth without rambling. Hopefully I'm not breaking any rules.

I recently received 10k in backpay from the VA - after paying off my credit card, I have roughly 7k to invest lump sum.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done some research in the space and have landed on buying a basket of BDC&amp;#39;s to spread the credit risk/effectively get direct lending beta.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, I have a Roth IRA, and Simple IRA and a brokerage account through fidelity. I max out my IRAs and contribute leftover money monthly into my fidelity account.

I feel that I am “behind” and not putting enough away. Because of this I feel that I need to pour extra money monthly into my fidelity account. Sometimes stressing me out that I don’t “make” enough even though I can cover all of our bills and have money for hobbies, vacation, entertainment, etc.

I am not sure where this comes from and/or how to get in the right mindset with it.

&lt;p&gt;Last night I took my current balances and compounded them at 8% for the next 25 years. I only gave the Roth IRA max contribution at the current limit, everything else I just let compound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came out with a 1.7mil portfolio. Of course with taxes and what not that number will be a bit less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition my wife is a government employee with a great retirement plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my dilemma…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that I am “behind” and not putting enough away. Because of this I feel that I need to pour extra money monthly into my fidelity account. Sometimes stressing me out that I don’t “make” enough even though I can cover all of our bills and have money for hobbies, vacation, entertainment, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure where this comes from and/or how to get in the right mindset with it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.7mil will definitely not be enough to live off, but even with just investing in my Simple IRA and Roth I feel that the fidelity account is an added bonus and wondering if it’s work it versus living and enjoying the moment with that extra cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;

Edit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

&lt;p&gt;A calculator shows this being ~2 million in 29 years at ~9% return. I assume a 4.5% withdraw rate equalling ~4,000$/m in todays dollars (after inflation adjusted). (Half that amount would likely be taxed at 10-12% federal from traditional IRA)&lt;/p&gt;

I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I'm normally an index funds kinda guy. 

My research suggests there are a few things I can do:

**Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.**

Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: 

* limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. 
* pay taxes -&gt; less to reinvest. 


**Buy protective puts**

Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren't free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. 

**Set a trailing stop loss**
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it's easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. 

So my questions are: are there other options I didn't consider?  Which of these is best if I am long term bullish on these stocks? 

If I look at protective puts, how do I structure the put? Do I set the strike price at the current price? Somewhere slightly below? Above? Significantly? What kind of experiation date should I aim for? Months years?

J&amp;J, which currently owns an 89.6% stake in Kenvue, said it intends to split off at least 80.1% of the consumer health company's shares as part of the offering.

The offering will help J&amp;J move a step closer in its plan to spin off the unit and focus on its larger medical devices and pharmaceuticals businesses.

TL;DR Does having more investors than ever before and faster opportunities for companies to grow account for the “outrageous multiples” we see?

I believe the average PE of the S&amp;P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don’t need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

With that in mind, I can’t help but think about the amount of new money that’s been brought in in the last 20 years as ease of access to investing, as well as financial savvy has grown. I mean look at the market cap of the US market here:

https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

Are we just in a new norm as a result of these things? I’m not saying the market isn’t overvalued but is it AS overvalued as analysts think or should we be adjusting our baselines?

My current ‘snapshot’ is as follows. All numbers converted to USD.

----

**Monthy passive income:** 
Approximately $120-140k gross, of which maybe 20-25% is post-tax income/profit. This will run till about the end of 2025. With no changes or lateral moves, this 120-140 will go down to around 20-25 from say 2025/26 onward.

**Investments:** 

$50k in a tech startup that has unicorn potential

$15k in crypto (worth around 9k now lol)

$20-30k in other miscellaneous ventures/startups

**Assets:** 
Not a lot to speak of, just the businesses I’m currently operating/overseeing with a few new startups/projects in very early stages sprinkled in. No real estate, no property, no car. Renting a flat for a very good price. 

Approx $700k cash post-tax profit in corporate accounts. Will still need to move this into personal, but there’s a plan in place for that (low TR).

Approx $150k in cash. I know, it’s way too much to have in cash.

**Debt:** 0

**Monthly spend/burn:** $1500-2000. Yeah...I live very frugally, partly by coincidence and the rest by design.

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&amp;#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|120|5|25|
|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.

113,investing,"I saved up about a six month emergency fund which I have sitting in a money market account. But as I've started to accumulate more money in a market index fund I have been wondering if keeping any money in a money market account makes sense so long as you have enough extra in stocks. The worst that can happen is that the market goes down right when I need the emergency fund, which could certainly happen together in an economic downturn. In that case I'd essentially be paying more for using the emergency fund.

Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I'd basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. 

So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.

Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I'm not considering?

&gt;**He has the power to wipe out the entire human race. If we believe there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.**

In financial planning, this is truer than ever. So many ""30-year"" projections all make massive assumptions. That 6-months of emergency funds will be enough. That interest rates on bonds will be ""safe"" (not anymore they're not). That real-estate will appreciate. That social security will be there for you. That the government won't default etc etc.

Often, people glibly dismiss worse-case scenarios saying *""Well, if that happens, you'll have bigger things to worry about""*. No, I fucking won't! The government can default, but my first concern will be protecting my finances.

So what am I preparing for? **I don't know.** I have no idea what to prepare for.

What is my long-term horizon? I don't know

When will I retire? **I don't know**

For how long will I live? **I don't know**

How much money will I need? **I don't know**

I have no idea what will go wrong, or when.

So I thought I'll share six things I do to prepare for the worst.

**Keep $200k in Cash Equivalents**

People often recommend a ""6-month"" emergency fund. As if life's major problems will only last 6-months. What if you get disabled? What if your entire job industry vanishes, and you're unemployed for six years?

So I keep a 75/25 stock/cash portfolio allocation.

More importantly, I can't even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.

**Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only**

I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I'll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.

Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it's not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.

Always assume that you're going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.

**A Strong Value Tilt**

In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post [in defense of dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/), so I won't rehash my arguments here. I'll add only this - dividends aren't enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.

In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the [Gordon equation](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808).

**Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me**

If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don't want complications at the worst possible time.

**Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife**

A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I [posted about it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/) :) . It's not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.

But in case I'm persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can *maybe* bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.

**No House - Rent Only**

A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don't know what kind of tenants you'll get. Too much risk.

Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.

Bottom line: Always assume that everything will fall apart. If it doesn't, it's a pleasant surprise. But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a quote in Batman v Superman, where Bruce Wayne tells Alfred this about Superman:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much money will I need? &lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what will go wrong, or when.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought I&amp;#39;ll share six things I do to prepare for the worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep $200k in Cash Equivalents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often recommend a &amp;quot;6-month&amp;quot; emergency fund. As if life&amp;#39;s major problems will only last 6-months. What if you get disabled? What if your entire job industry vanishes, and you&amp;#39;re unemployed for six years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I keep a 75/25 stock/cash portfolio allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, I can&amp;#39;t even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I&amp;#39;ll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it&amp;#39;s not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always assume that you&amp;#39;re going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Strong Value Tilt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/""&gt;in defense of dividends&lt;/a&gt;, so I won&amp;#39;t rehash my arguments here. I&amp;#39;ll add only this - dividends aren&amp;#39;t enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the &lt;a href=""https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808""&gt;Gordon equation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don&amp;#39;t want complications at the worst possible time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/""&gt;posted about it on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; :) . It&amp;#39;s not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in case I&amp;#39;m persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No House - Rent Only&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don&amp;#39;t know what kind of tenants you&amp;#39;ll get. Too much risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Always assume that everything will fall apart. If it doesn&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s a pleasant surprise. But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi everyone! I am a 26-year-old male from the Netherlands, and I am looking to start investing in the stock market. I have saved up 1000 Euros as an initial investment and plan to contribute 200 Euros per month going forward. After doing some research, I am considering investing in a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. However, I have some questions and would love to hear your thoughts and advice:

	1.	Is now a good time to step into the market, given the current economic conditions and market trends?
	2.	Considering my age and long-term investment horizon, does investing in a 2x leveraged ETF make sense, or are there other investment strategies I should consider?
	3.	Should I go 100% in on the S&amp;P 500 2x leverage ETF, or would a diversified portfolio be a better approach?
	4.	What are the potential risks and rewards of investing in a 2x leveraged ETF, and how can I best manage those risks?

- put anything leftover into VMFXX

Interested to see if there is any research out there that could suggest active trading beats B&amp;H. 

I've done some small backtesting on a few hundred trades that I thought I had identified as non-random movements, and even still the win % only really comes out to about 54% with a 1:1 Risk reward ratio. 

Theoretically, that has positive expected value, however, due to randomness, and the win % not being high enough, you are basically jsut chopping around and maybe making a few % points here and there on the most likely run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Again, this was just some small testing I personally did but everything in my view doesn't really hold up to simple B&amp;H over the long run. 

With that being said, I was interested in seeing if there is research out there comparing buy and hold to active management / active trading over a large enough data set and if there is potentially above what you would normally get by just buying a Vanguard index fund. 

Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it's because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I've made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same. You are basically around break even, + or - a few % points over enough trade samples. 

I don't see how you could ever outperform B&amp;H by actively trading. 

Anyways, interested in looking forward to the research if there is any.

&lt;p&gt;Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it&amp;#39;s because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I&amp;#39;ve made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same. You are basically around break even, + or - a few % points over enough trade samples. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see how you could ever outperform B&amp;amp;H by actively trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, interested in looking forward to the research if there is any. &lt;/p&gt;

151,investing,"Hi I have a (perhaps newby) question about shorting.  
  
I will use the commodity NATGAS as an example which is $2.69 (01-aug.-'23) and I use Etoro as platform.  
However, the question is a general question for all platforms I suppose:  
  
I see that if eg. today I open a short (CFD, 1x) of $1000,- I get a weekly fee of $10.49 indefinitely as long as my position does not hit stop loss.  
I can move my stop loss to $14.8 if I add another $4000,- to my position.  
So using $5000 in total, I get $10.49\*52=$545 annually. This is more than 10%!!  
  
Now, I get that if the price of NATGAS rises, I am in ''trouble'', but not as long as it stays under my SL. I could even put the fees I receive back into my position increasing the SL further over time whilst maintaining the $545 annual fee.  
If I look at the history of NATGAS (known for more than 25 years) it never reached $15,-  
  
I know that results from the past are no guarantees for the future but still it feels like a solid way to get $545 annually! Why isn't everyone doing this then...

I'll try to be in depth without rambling. Hopefully I'm not breaking any rules.

I recently received 10k in backpay from the VA - after paying off my credit card, I have roughly 7k to invest lump sum.

Monthly, I'll have roughly 1500 to invest from my disability pay, with no taxable income due to being unable to work, so all into regular brokerage at schwab.

I have no immediate plans nor expenses, but do plan to move within the next year. My risk tolerance is relatively high, but not high enough for individual stocks.

Here lies my plan, and the questions that follow: dump all 7k into VT, then take the 1500 and divide it into thirds to invest into:

VT/SCHB/BND

Is there any significant difference between doing the above three and doing VT/SWTSX/SWAGX? And, since my investments have to go into my taxable account, are bonds even worth it at that point?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

During that time, I received exactly one ride request for a grand total of $7.50. With hourly revenue like that (before vehicle expenses), Uber is no longer a profitable sideline for me as a driver. I&amp;#39;m going to return to W2 land starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice to Uber shareholders: use extreme caution when listening to the corporate propaganda spewing from CEO Dara&amp;#39;s mouth. There is very little demand among either hipsters or low income folk for rides right now based on my experience. I&amp;#39;m not a gambler or big risk taker, so I&amp;#39;m not going to short the stock or buy puts. But if I had a more substantial cash cushion, I would definitely be betting against Uber in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

189,investing,"To start with, I'm 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22. Right now, my portfolio is just around a million dollars - still waiting to get a $87k tax refund from the government. Here's a screenshot of my portfolio:

[https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg)

Edit: The portfolio total is in Canadian dollars. So convert US holdings like SCHD, VOO, IBTG etc from USD to CAD, and the total should add up.

Edit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

Edit: For those of you reaching out, worried about me being attacked here, don't worry. I'm 41 years and a grown ass adult. Words won't hurt me :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start with, I&amp;#39;m 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22. Right now, my portfolio is just around a million dollars - still waiting to get a $87k tax refund from the government. Here&amp;#39;s a screenshot of my portfolio:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: The portfolio total is in Canadian dollars. So convert US holdings like SCHD, VOO, IBTG etc from USD to CAD, and the total should add up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: You&amp;#39;ll see that I&amp;#39;m not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I&amp;#39;m not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about &amp;quot;young&amp;quot; investors chasing dividends: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;m not exactly old, I&amp;#39;m not exactly young either. And here&amp;#39;s why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Arguments for Dividends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No investor thinks that dividends are &amp;quot;free money&amp;quot;. Obviously money doesn&amp;#39;t grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a &amp;quot;gotcha&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company&amp;#39;s assets. So let&amp;#39;s get that out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a fundamental level, I don&amp;#39;t care about stock prices. I care about only two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) What is my income stream?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) How fast is that income stream growing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person&amp;#39;s wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here&amp;#39;s a quote from Great Expectations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book &amp;quot;The Four Pillars of Investing&amp;quot;, Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I don&amp;#39;t care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you&amp;#39;re poor. At least for me. Doesn&amp;#39;t matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Dividends ARE From a Company&amp;#39;s Earnings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don&amp;#39;t use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn&amp;#39;t hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the big one. The theory goes that companies that don&amp;#39;t pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn&amp;#39;t want that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. &lt;strong&gt;That money was yours&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#39;s human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a company to retain dividends, they need to &lt;em&gt;generate a higher return than their own current cashflow&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they&amp;#39;re promising that they&amp;#39;ll get even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that&amp;#39;s your gamble to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you re-invest your dividends, you&amp;#39;re purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven &lt;strong&gt;they can already generate&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#39;s not pie-in-the-sky &amp;quot;trust me bro&amp;quot; cashflow. You know the company&amp;#39;s track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You&amp;#39;re buying more of the same. It&amp;#39;s more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English used to have a saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It&amp;#39;s stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. When a Company Fails, All You&amp;#39;re Left with is Dividends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it&amp;#39;s in distress and that shareholders won&amp;#39;t get the value of the company&amp;#39;s assets, so that&amp;#39;s a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I'm normally an index funds kinda guy.

Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: 

* limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. 
* pay taxes -&gt; less to reinvest. 


**Buy protective puts**

Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact.

**Set a trailing stop loss**
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it's easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. 

So my questions are: are there other options I didn't consider?  Which of these is best if I am long term bullish on these stocks?

TL;DR Does having more investors than ever before and faster opportunities for companies to grow account for the “outrageous multiples” we see?

I believe the average PE of the S&amp;P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don’t need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

206,investing,"Hi everyone. I’d love to ask some advice. I’m early 40s, based in europe. I began setting up passive income streams about 10 years ago, and have been in and out of brick and mortar businesses in that time as well. Recently got out of a restaurant…dear lord never again.

I think my story and situation are quite unique. I got unlucky a bunch of times, and got really lucky a couple of times. I don’t think I’ve been particularly responsible, just lucky, as I’ve taken huge risks, some of which panned out. Most of all the good stuff happened in the last couple of years, before then I was just building and stressing stressing stressing.

I’d love some advice on what my next steps could/should be, and why. I feel totally ‘outside’ the system and would like at least some part of my portfolio to be sensible and conventional, but I’d also like to hear about more aggressive/risky plays. I know I’m in a very fortuitous position, and I want to make sure I’m doing all I can to maximize my good fortune.

My current ‘snapshot’ is as follows. All numbers converted to USD.

----

**Monthy passive income:** 
Approximately $120-140k gross, of which maybe 20-25% is post-tax income/profit. This will run till about the end of 2025. With no changes or lateral moves, this 120-140 will go down to around 20-25 from say 2025/26 onward.

**Investments:** 

$50k in a tech startup that has unicorn potential

$15k in crypto (worth around 9k now lol)

$20-30k in other miscellaneous ventures/startups

**Assets:** 
Not a lot to speak of, just the businesses I’m currently operating/overseeing with a few new startups/projects in very early stages sprinkled in. No real estate, no property, no car. Renting a flat for a very good price. 

Approx $700k cash post-tax profit in corporate accounts. Will still need to move this into personal, but there’s a plan in place for that (low TR).

Approx $150k in cash. I know, it’s way too much to have in cash.

**Debt:** 0

**Monthly spend/burn:** $1500-2000. Yeah...I live very frugally, partly by coincidence and the rest by design.

No kids, no wife, no dependants. Family in EU, Canada and Mexico.

&lt;p&gt;I think my story and situation are quite unique. I got unlucky a bunch of times, and got really lucky a couple of times. I don’t think I’ve been particularly responsible, just lucky, as I’ve taken huge risks, some of which panned out. Most of all the good stuff happened in the last couple of years, before then I was just building and stressing stressing stressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love some advice on what my next steps could/should be, and why. I feel totally ‘outside’ the system and would like at least some part of my portfolio to be sensible and conventional, but I’d also like to hear about more aggressive/risky plays. I know I’m in a very fortuitous position, and I want to make sure I’m doing all I can to maximize my good fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current ‘snapshot’ is as follows. All numbers converted to USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthy passive income:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Approximately $120-140k gross, of which maybe 20-25% is post-tax income/profit. This will run till about the end of 2025. With no changes or lateral moves, this 120-140 will go down to around 20-25 from say 2025/26 onward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investments:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$50k in a tech startup that has unicorn potential&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$15k in crypto (worth around 9k now lol)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$20-30k in other miscellaneous ventures/startups&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assets:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Not a lot to speak of, just the businesses I’m currently operating/overseeing with a few new startups/projects in very early stages sprinkled in. No real estate, no property, no car. Renting a flat for a very good price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approx $700k cash post-tax profit in corporate accounts. Will still need to move this into personal, but there’s a plan in place for that (low TR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approx $150k in cash. I know, it’s way too much to have in cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debt:&lt;/strong&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly spend/burn:&lt;/strong&gt; $1500-2000. Yeah...I live very frugally, partly by coincidence and the rest by design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No kids, no wife, no dependants. Family in EU, Canada and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything at all you guys can offer would be interesting to read. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

210,investing,"Hi all,

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&amp;#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|120|5|25|
|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.

213,investing,"I saved up about a six month emergency fund which I have sitting in a money market account. But as I've started to accumulate more money in a market index fund I have been wondering if keeping any money in a money market account makes sense so long as you have enough extra in stocks. The worst that can happen is that the market goes down right when I need the emergency fund, which could certainly happen together in an economic downturn. In that case I'd essentially be paying more for using the emergency fund.

Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I'd basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. 

So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.

Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I'm not considering?

&gt;**He has the power to wipe out the entire human race. If we believe there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.**

In financial planning, this is truer than ever. So many ""30-year"" projections all make massive assumptions. That 6-months of emergency funds will be enough. That interest rates on bonds will be ""safe"" (not anymore they're not). That real-estate will appreciate. That social security will be there for you. That the government won't default etc etc.

Often, people glibly dismiss worse-case scenarios saying *""Well, if that happens, you'll have bigger things to worry about""*. No, I fucking won't! The government can default, but my first concern will be protecting my finances.

So what am I preparing for? **I don't know.** I have no idea what to prepare for.

What is my long-term horizon? I don't know

When will I retire? **I don't know**

For how long will I live? **I don't know**

How much money will I need? **I don't know**

I have no idea what will go wrong, or when.

So I thought I'll share six things I do to prepare for the worst.

**Keep $200k in Cash Equivalents**

People often recommend a ""6-month"" emergency fund. As if life's major problems will only last 6-months. What if you get disabled? What if your entire job industry vanishes, and you're unemployed for six years?

So I keep a 75/25 stock/cash portfolio allocation.

More importantly, I can't even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.

**Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only**

I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I'll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.

Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it's not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.

Always assume that you're going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.

**A Strong Value Tilt**

In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post [in defense of dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/), so I won't rehash my arguments here. I'll add only this - dividends aren't enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.

In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the [Gordon equation](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808).

**Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me**

If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don't want complications at the worst possible time.

**Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife**

A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I [posted about it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/) :) . It's not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.

But in case I'm persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can *maybe* bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.

**No House - Rent Only**

A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don't know what kind of tenants you'll get. Too much risk.

Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.

Bottom line: Always assume that everything will fall apart. If it doesn't, it's a pleasant surprise. But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a quote in Batman v Superman, where Bruce Wayne tells Alfred this about Superman:&lt;/p&gt;

 What I particularly like about Ameritrade is I can always get a live human help within a minute or two day or night. Does Schwab have that kind of live customer service? What's good about Schwab? Why would I want to transfer there?  What might be a better place to put a relatively modest (under $25K) IRA account (It is not a Roth)?

&lt;p&gt;I called Ameritrade this morning and the help desk said I have until Aug. 18th to move it to Schwab. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t pick Schwab and I don&amp;#39;t known anything about that company except it wants to scoop up my account. People who know more than I do about investing say it&amp;#39;s not the greatest platform and kind of clunky compared to Ameritrade (which I really liked - very good service, nice people, quick response. I was very satisfied). &lt;/p&gt;

Interested to see if there is any research out there that could suggest active trading beats B&amp;H. 

I've done some small backtesting on a few hundred trades that I thought I had identified as non-random movements, and even still the win % only really comes out to about 54% with a 1:1 Risk reward ratio. 

Theoretically, that has positive expected value, however, due to randomness, and the win % not being high enough, you are basically jsut chopping around and maybe making a few % points here and there on the most likely run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Again, this was just some small testing I personally did but everything in my view doesn't really hold up to simple B&amp;H over the long run. 

With that being said, I was interested in seeing if there is research out there comparing buy and hold to active management / active trading over a large enough data set and if there is potentially above what you would normally get by just buying a Vanguard index fund. 

Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it's because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I've made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same. You are basically around break even, + or - a few % points over enough trade samples.

&lt;p&gt;Hilarious 12 million assets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than 1 million in cash!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description of the company is that it&amp;#39;s involved in all kind of investments, but if this is true why it&amp;#39;s missing from the balance sheet? How one could make venture capital level investments with less than 1 million of cash? Somehow the stock price was 5% up in Friday...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are all of the stockowners bag holders with the most massive bags one could imagine? I must be missing something here. Usually venture capital firms are private. If this one is not sharing ANY assets/profits/dividends/cash with it&amp;#39;s public shareholders why is it publicly traded and why would anyone put their money in it, let alone $4 billion? Shouldn&amp;#39;t this type of investing be done via private equity ownership?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that it has a subsidiary PowerTap Hydrogen Fueling Corp, but this isn&amp;#39;t helping as the subsidiary isn&amp;#39;t traded public. Besides shouldn&amp;#39;t this ownership be reflected on the balance sheet or it&amp;#39;s not how accounting works?&lt;/p&gt;

Now suppose, in the first year, I made a **loss of $100k** on the futures contract as the the market crashed. The next year, the market recovered to the exact level where I started and I gained **$100k on the same futures contract.**

1) Due to marked-to-market accounting, will I be paying $0 on the loss the first year and roughly 25% taxes on this $100k gain at the end of the second year even though the market didn't really gain?

Edit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

Words won't hurt me :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start with, I&amp;#39;m 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22.

During liquidation, chances are that it&amp;#39;s in distress and that shareholders won&amp;#39;t get the value of the company&amp;#39;s assets, so that&amp;#39;s a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Microsoft&amp;#39;s yield is low. But it&amp;#39;s growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one denies that companies need to retain &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company&amp;#39;s cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my strategy, and I&amp;#39;m sticking to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: For those of you reaching out, worried about me being attacked here, don&amp;#39;t worry. I&amp;#39;m 41 years and a grown ass adult. Words won&amp;#39;t hurt me :)&lt;/p&gt;

I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I'm normally an index funds kinda guy. 

My research suggests there are a few things I can do:

**Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.**

Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: 

* limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. 
* pay taxes -&gt; less to reinvest. 


**Buy protective puts**

Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren't free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. 

**Set a trailing stop loss**
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it's easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. 

So my questions are: are there other options I didn't consider?  Which of these is best if I am long term bullish on these stocks? 

If I look at protective puts, how do I structure the put? Do I set the strike price at the current price? Somewhere slightly below? Above? Significantly? What kind of experiation date should I aim for? Months years?

I’m looking to roll over my previous Pretax 401k funds into this Roth 401k, and understand I will need to pay taxes on the funds. It is a low amount, so I’m not very worried about this.

TL;DR Does having more investors than ever before and faster opportunities for companies to grow account for the “outrageous multiples” we see?

I believe the average PE of the S&amp;P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don’t need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

With that in mind, I can’t help but think about the amount of new money that’s been brought in in the last 20 years as ease of access to investing, as well as financial savvy has grown. I mean look at the market cap of the US market here:

https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

Are we just in a new norm as a result of these things? I’m not saying the market isn’t overvalued but is it AS overvalued as analysts think or should we be adjusting our baselines?

306,investing,"Hi everyone. I’d love to ask some advice. I’m early 40s, based in europe. I began setting up passive income streams about 10 years ago, and have been in and out of brick and mortar businesses in that time as well. Recently got out of a restaurant…dear lord never again.

I think my story and situation are quite unique. I got unlucky a bunch of times, and got really lucky a couple of times. I don’t think I’ve been particularly responsible, just lucky, as I’ve taken huge risks, some of which panned out. Most of all the good stuff happened in the last couple of years, before then I was just building and stressing stressing stressing.

I’d love some advice on what my next steps could/should be, and why. I feel totally ‘outside’ the system and would like at least some part of my portfolio to be sensible and conventional, but I’d also like to hear about more aggressive/risky plays. I know I’m in a very fortuitous position, and I want to make sure I’m doing all I can to maximize my good fortune.

My current ‘snapshot’ is as follows. All numbers converted to USD.

----

**Monthy passive income:** 
Approximately $120-140k gross, of which maybe 20-25% is post-tax income/profit. This will run till about the end of 2025. With no changes or lateral moves, this 120-140 will go down to around 20-25 from say 2025/26 onward.

**Investments:** 

$50k in a tech startup that has unicorn potential

$15k in crypto (worth around 9k now lol)

$20-30k in other miscellaneous ventures/startups

**Assets:** 
Not a lot to speak of, just the businesses I’m currently operating/overseeing with a few new startups/projects in very early stages sprinkled in. No real estate, no property, no car. Renting a flat for a very good price. 

Approx $700k cash post-tax profit in corporate accounts. Will still need to move this into personal, but there’s a plan in place for that (low TR).

Approx $150k in cash. I know, it’s way too much to have in cash.

**Debt:** 0

**Monthly spend/burn:** $1500-2000. Yeah...I live very frugally, partly by coincidence and the rest by design.

No kids, no wife, no dependants. Family in EU, Canada and Mexico.

Can I just transfer the stock over to the ROTH IRA? Also, once I have maxed out the ROTH IRA what is the best move with the individual account?&lt;br/&gt;
Thank you for taking the time to read this, and please bear with me, I am completely new to this. Please let me know if you need any additional information. TYIA.&lt;/p&gt;

310,investing,"Hi all,

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&amp;#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|120|5|25|
|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.

I am 33M.  

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.  

I started getting more serious and doing a lot more research in the last year or so and have accepted my losses and sold off my bad investments.  I've now invested in a mix of growth/ETFs like VOO, SCHD, AAPL, and TSLA

Lately, I just feel like the ""safest"" and more guaranteed return on investments are CDs and T-Bills given the interest rates they are offering (5% - 5.5%). I am in the process of setting up a CD/T-Bills ladder where I'd have maturing CDs or T-Bills monthly starting later this year. 

Should I continue with this approach? I know the interest rates will fluctuate and may not always be high but I haven't seen any of my investments besides TSLA really take off (AAPL has done decent). As noted above, I actually lost a good amount in the past.  

Right now, my goal is to not think about it everyday and just have my money grow over time (I will not need the cash). Should I just put it all in VOO? Leave it in SPAXX? Or just continue the ladder strategy? Are there any risks I'm not considering?

313,investing,"I saved up about a six month emergency fund which I have sitting in a money market account. But as I've started to accumulate more money in a market index fund I have been wondering if keeping any money in a money market account makes sense so long as you have enough extra in stocks. The worst that can happen is that the market goes down right when I need the emergency fund, which could certainly happen together in an economic downturn. In that case I'd essentially be paying more for using the emergency fund.

Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I'd basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. 

So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.

Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I'm not considering?

&gt;**He has the power to wipe out the entire human race. If we believe there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.**

In financial planning, this is truer than ever. So many ""30-year"" projections all make massive assumptions. That 6-months of emergency funds will be enough. That interest rates on bonds will be ""safe"" (not anymore they're not). That real-estate will appreciate. That social security will be there for you. That the government won't default etc etc.

Often, people glibly dismiss worse-case scenarios saying *""Well, if that happens, you'll have bigger things to worry about""*. No, I fucking won't! The government can default, but my first concern will be protecting my finances.

So what am I preparing for? **I don't know.** I have no idea what to prepare for.

What is my long-term horizon? I don't know

When will I retire? **I don't know**

For how long will I live? **I don't know**

How much money will I need? **I don't know**

I have no idea what will go wrong, or when.

So I thought I'll share six things I do to prepare for the worst.

**Keep $200k in Cash Equivalents**

People often recommend a ""6-month"" emergency fund. As if life's major problems will only last 6-months. What if you get disabled? What if your entire job industry vanishes, and you're unemployed for six years?

So I keep a 75/25 stock/cash portfolio allocation.

More importantly, I can't even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.

**Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only**

I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I'll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.

Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it's not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.

Always assume that you're going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.

**A Strong Value Tilt**

In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post [in defense of dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/), so I won't rehash my arguments here. I'll add only this - dividends aren't enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.

In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the [Gordon equation](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808).

**Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me**

If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don't want complications at the worst possible time.

**Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife**

A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I [posted about it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/) :) . It's not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.

But in case I'm persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can *maybe* bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.

**No House - Rent Only**

A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don't know what kind of tenants you'll get. Too much risk.

Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.

But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a quote in Batman v Superman, where Bruce Wayne tells Alfred this about Superman:&lt;/p&gt;

I have saved up 1000 Euros as an initial investment and plan to contribute 200 Euros per month going forward. After doing some research, I am considering investing in a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. However, I have some questions and would love to hear your thoughts and advice:

	1.	Is now a good time to step into the market, given the current economic conditions and market trends?
	2.	Considering my age and long-term investment horizon, does investing in a 2x leveraged ETF make sense, or are there other investment strategies I should consider?
	3.	Should I go 100% in on the S&amp;P 500 2x leverage ETF, or would a diversified portfolio be a better approach?

Interested to see if there is any research out there that could suggest active trading beats B&amp;H. 

I've done some small backtesting on a few hundred trades that I thought I had identified as non-random movements, and even still the win % only really comes out to about 54% with a 1:1 Risk reward ratio. 

Theoretically, that has positive expected value, however, due to randomness, and the win % not being high enough, you are basically jsut chopping around and maybe making a few % points here and there on the most likely run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Again, this was just some small testing I personally did but everything in my view doesn't really hold up to simple B&amp;H over the long run. 

With that being said, I was interested in seeing if there is research out there comparing buy and hold to active management / active trading over a large enough data set and if there is potentially above what you would normally get by just buying a Vanguard index fund. 

Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it's because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I've made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same. You are basically around break even, + or - a few % points over enough trade samples. 

I don't see how you could ever outperform B&amp;H by actively trading.

I will use the commodity NATGAS as an example which is $2.69 (01-aug.-'23) and I use Etoro as platform.  
However, the question is a general question for all platforms I suppose:  
  
I see that if eg. today I open a short (CFD, 1x) of $1000,- I get a weekly fee of $10.49 indefinitely as long as my position does not hit stop loss.  
I can move my stop loss to $14.8 if I add another $4000,- to my position.  
So using $5000 in total, I get $10.49\*52=$545 annually. This is more than 10%!!  
  
Now, I get that if the price of NATGAS rises, I am in ''trouble'', but not as long as it stays under my SL. I could even put the fees I receive back into my position increasing the SL further over time whilst maintaining the $545 annual fee.  
If I look at the history of NATGAS (known for more than 25 years) it never reached $15,-  
  
I know that results from the past are no guarantees for the future but still it feels like a solid way to get $545 annually! Why isn't everyone doing this then...

So I've thought of opening an account with something like Fundrise or Crowdstreet. I think both of these have different options for accredited investors, which I'm not yet. If I do set up an account, it would be a pretty small portion of my portfolio- I'm thinking like maybe $100/month compared to currently I'm putting \~2-3k per month into ETFs

I'll try to be in depth without rambling. Hopefully I'm not breaking any rules.

I recently received 10k in backpay from the VA - after paying off my credit card, I have roughly 7k to invest lump sum.

Monthly, I'll have roughly 1500 to invest from my disability pay, with no taxable income due to being unable to work, so all into regular brokerage at schwab.

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I'm normally an index funds kinda guy. 

My research suggests there are a few things I can do:

**Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.**

Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: 

* limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. 
* pay taxes -&gt; less to reinvest. 


**Buy protective puts**

Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren't free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. 

**Set a trailing stop loss**
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it's easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. 

So my questions are: are there other options I didn't consider?  Which of these is best if I am long term bullish on these stocks? 

If I look at protective puts, how do I structure the put? Do I set the strike price at the current price? Somewhere slightly below? Above? Significantly? What kind of experiation date should I aim for? Months years? 

Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,
I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I&amp;#39;m normally an index funds kinda guy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research suggests there are a few things I can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay taxes -&amp;gt; less to reinvest. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy protective puts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren&amp;#39;t free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J, which currently owns an 89.6% stake in Kenvue, said it intends to split off at least 80.1% of the consumer health company&amp;#39;s shares as part of the offering.&lt;/p&gt;

TL;DR Does having more investors than ever before and faster opportunities for companies to grow account for the “outrageous multiples” we see?

I believe the average PE of the S&amp;P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don’t need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

With that in mind, I can’t help but think about the amount of new money that’s been brought in in the last 20 years as ease of access to investing, as well as financial savvy has grown. I mean look at the market cap of the US market here:

https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

Are we just in a new norm as a result of these things? I’m not saying the market isn’t overvalued but is it AS overvalued as analysts think or should we be adjusting our baselines?

I think my story and situation are quite unique. I got unlucky a bunch of times, and got really lucky a couple of times. I don’t think I’ve been particularly responsible, just lucky, as I’ve taken huge risks, some of which panned out. Most of all the good stuff happened in the last couple of years, before then I was just building and stressing stressing stressing.

I’d love some advice on what my next steps could/should be, and why. I feel totally ‘outside’ the system and would like at least some part of my portfolio to be sensible and conventional, but I’d also like to hear about more aggressive/risky plays. I know I’m in a very fortuitous position, and I want to make sure I’m doing all I can to maximize my good fortune.

My current ‘snapshot’ is as follows. All numbers converted to USD.

----

**Monthy passive income:** 
Approximately $120-140k gross, of which maybe 20-25% is post-tax income/profit. This will run till about the end of 2025. With no changes or lateral moves, this 120-140 will go down to around 20-25 from say 2025/26 onward.

**Investments:** 

$50k in a tech startup that has unicorn potential

$15k in crypto (worth around 9k now lol)

$20-30k in other miscellaneous ventures/startups

**Assets:** 
Not a lot to speak of, just the businesses I’m currently operating/overseeing with a few new startups/projects in very early stages sprinkled in. No real estate, no property, no car. Renting a flat for a very good price. 

Approx $700k cash post-tax profit in corporate accounts. Will still need to move this into personal, but there’s a plan in place for that (low TR).

Approx $150k in cash. I know, it’s way too much to have in cash.

**Debt:** 0

**Monthly spend/burn:** $1500-2000. Yeah...I live very frugally, partly by coincidence and the rest by design.

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&amp;#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|120|5|25|
|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.

Although I'm no expert in the hospitality sector, I'd imagine there's a natural limit that consumers will pay for a coffee from a fast food chain, before they'll just go to say, Starbucks.

My question is, how do companies - particularly in this era of inflation - avoid overestimating their pricing power, and thus driving down sales with higher prices?

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.

413,investing,"I saved up about a six month emergency fund which I have sitting in a money market account. But as I've started to accumulate more money in a market index fund I have been wondering if keeping any money in a money market account makes sense so long as you have enough extra in stocks. The worst that can happen is that the market goes down right when I need the emergency fund, which could certainly happen together in an economic downturn. In that case I'd essentially be paying more for using the emergency fund.

Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I'd basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. 

So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.

Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I'm not considering?

&gt;**He has the power to wipe out the entire human race. If we believe there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.**

In financial planning, this is truer than ever. So many ""30-year"" projections all make massive assumptions. That 6-months of emergency funds will be enough. That interest rates on bonds will be ""safe"" (not anymore they're not). That real-estate will appreciate. That social security will be there for you. That the government won't default etc etc.

Often, people glibly dismiss worse-case scenarios saying *""Well, if that happens, you'll have bigger things to worry about""*. No, I fucking won't! The government can default, but my first concern will be protecting my finances.

So what am I preparing for? **I don't know.** I have no idea what to prepare for.

What is my long-term horizon? I don't know

When will I retire? **I don't know**

For how long will I live? **I don't know**

How much money will I need? **I don't know**

I have no idea what will go wrong, or when.

So I thought I'll share six things I do to prepare for the worst.

**Keep $200k in Cash Equivalents**

People often recommend a ""6-month"" emergency fund. As if life's major problems will only last 6-months. What if you get disabled? What if your entire job industry vanishes, and you're unemployed for six years?

So I keep a 75/25 stock/cash portfolio allocation.

More importantly, I can't even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.

**Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only**

I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I'll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.

Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it's not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.

Always assume that you're going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.

**A Strong Value Tilt**

In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post [in defense of dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/), so I won't rehash my arguments here. I'll add only this - dividends aren't enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.

In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the [Gordon equation](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808).

**Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me**

If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don't want complications at the worst possible time.

**Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife**

A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I [posted about it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/) :) . It's not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.

But in case I'm persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can *maybe* bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.

**No House - Rent Only**

A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don't know what kind of tenants you'll get. Too much risk.

Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.

Bottom line: Always assume that everything will fall apart. If it doesn't, it's a pleasant surprise. But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a quote in Batman v Superman, where Bruce Wayne tells Alfred this about Superman:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, I can&amp;#39;t even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I&amp;#39;ll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it&amp;#39;s not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always assume that you&amp;#39;re going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Strong Value Tilt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/""&gt;in defense of dividends&lt;/a&gt;, so I won&amp;#39;t rehash my arguments here. I&amp;#39;ll add only this - dividends aren&amp;#39;t enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the &lt;a href=""https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808""&gt;Gordon equation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don&amp;#39;t want complications at the worst possible time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/""&gt;posted about it on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; :) . It&amp;#39;s not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in case I&amp;#39;m persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No House - Rent Only&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don&amp;#39;t know what kind of tenants you&amp;#39;ll get. Too much risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Always assume that everything will fall apart. If it doesn&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s a pleasant surprise. But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi everyone! I am a 26-year-old male from the Netherlands, and I am looking to start investing in the stock market. I have saved up 1000 Euros as an initial investment and plan to contribute 200 Euros per month going forward. After doing some research, I am considering investing in a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. However, I have some questions and would love to hear your thoughts and advice:

	1.	Is now a good time to step into the market, given the current economic conditions and market trends?
	2.	Considering my age and long-term investment horizon, does investing in a 2x leveraged ETF make sense, or are there other investment strategies I should consider?
	3.	Should I go 100% in on the S&amp;P 500 2x leverage ETF, or would a diversified portfolio be a better approach?
	4.	What are the potential risks and rewards of investing in a 2x leveraged ETF, and how can I best manage those risks?

       -choosing Roth because my 2023 income will be lower than 2024 due to starting midway this year (will switch to traditional starting 2024)
       -Rollover my Roth 401k to my Roth IRA if I switch jobs
- put anything leftover into VMFXX

Interested to see if there is any research out there that could suggest active trading beats B&amp;H. 

I've done some small backtesting on a few hundred trades that I thought I had identified as non-random movements, and even still the win % only really comes out to about 54% with a 1:1 Risk reward ratio. 

Theoretically, that has positive expected value, however, due to randomness, and the win % not being high enough, you are basically jsut chopping around and maybe making a few % points here and there on the most likely run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Again, this was just some small testing I personally did but everything in my view doesn't really hold up to simple B&amp;H over the long run. 

With that being said, I was interested in seeing if there is research out there comparing buy and hold to active management / active trading over a large enough data set and if there is potentially above what you would normally get by just buying a Vanguard index fund. 

Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it's because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I've made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same. You are basically around break even, + or - a few % points over enough trade samples. 

I don't see how you could ever outperform B&amp;H by actively trading.

451,investing,"Hi I have a (perhaps newby) question about shorting.  
  
I will use the commodity NATGAS as an example which is $2.69 (01-aug.-'23) and I use Etoro as platform.  
However, the question is a general question for all platforms I suppose:  
  
I see that if eg. today I open a short (CFD, 1x) of $1000,- I get a weekly fee of $10.49 indefinitely as long as my position does not hit stop loss.  
I can move my stop loss to $14.8 if I add another $4000,- to my position.  
So using $5000 in total, I get $10.49\*52=$545 annually. This is more than 10%!!  
  
Now, I get that if the price of NATGAS rises, I am in ''trouble'', but not as long as it stays under my SL. I could even put the fees I receive back into my position increasing the SL further over time whilst maintaining the $545 annual fee.  
If I look at the history of NATGAS (known for more than 25 years) it never reached $15,-  
  
I know that results from the past are no guarantees for the future but still it feels like a solid way to get $545 annually! Why isn't everyone doing this then...

I'll try to be in depth without rambling. Hopefully I'm not breaking any rules.

I recently received 10k in backpay from the VA - after paying off my credit card, I have roughly 7k to invest lump sum.

Monthly, I'll have roughly 1500 to invest from my disability pay, with no taxable income due to being unable to work, so all into regular brokerage at schwab.

I have no immediate plans nor expenses, but do plan to move within the next year. My risk tolerance is relatively high, but not high enough for individual stocks.

Here lies my plan, and the questions that follow: dump all 7k into VT, then take the 1500 and divide it into thirds to invest into:

VT/SCHB/BND

Is there any significant difference between doing the above three and doing VT/SWTSX/SWAGX? And, since my investments have to go into my taxable account, are bonds even worth it at that point?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

[https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg)

Edit: The portfolio total is in Canadian dollars. So convert US holdings like SCHD, VOO, IBTG etc from USD to CAD, and the total should add up.

Edit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

Edit: For those of you reaching out, worried about me being attacked here, don't worry. I'm 41 years and a grown ass adult. Words won't hurt me :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start with, I&amp;#39;m 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22. Right now, my portfolio is just around a million dollars - still waiting to get a $87k tax refund from the government. Here&amp;#39;s a screenshot of my portfolio:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: The portfolio total is in Canadian dollars. So convert US holdings like SCHD, VOO, IBTG etc from USD to CAD, and the total should add up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: You&amp;#39;ll see that I&amp;#39;m not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I&amp;#39;m not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about &amp;quot;young&amp;quot; investors chasing dividends: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;m not exactly old, I&amp;#39;m not exactly young either. And here&amp;#39;s why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Arguments for Dividends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No investor thinks that dividends are &amp;quot;free money&amp;quot;. Obviously money doesn&amp;#39;t grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a &amp;quot;gotcha&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company&amp;#39;s assets. So let&amp;#39;s get that out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a fundamental level, I don&amp;#39;t care about stock prices. I care about only two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) What is my income stream?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) How fast is that income stream growing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person&amp;#39;s wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here&amp;#39;s a quote from Great Expectations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book &amp;quot;The Four Pillars of Investing&amp;quot;, Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I don&amp;#39;t care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you&amp;#39;re poor. At least for me. Doesn&amp;#39;t matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Dividends ARE From a Company&amp;#39;s Earnings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don&amp;#39;t use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn&amp;#39;t hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the big one. The theory goes that companies that don&amp;#39;t pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn&amp;#39;t want that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. &lt;strong&gt;That money was yours&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#39;s human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a company to retain dividends, they need to &lt;em&gt;generate a higher return than their own current cashflow&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they&amp;#39;re promising that they&amp;#39;ll get even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that&amp;#39;s your gamble to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you re-invest your dividends, you&amp;#39;re purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven &lt;strong&gt;they can already generate&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#39;s not pie-in-the-sky &amp;quot;trust me bro&amp;quot; cashflow. You know the company&amp;#39;s track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You&amp;#39;re buying more of the same. It&amp;#39;s more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English used to have a saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It&amp;#39;s stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. When a Company Fails, All You&amp;#39;re Left with is Dividends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it&amp;#39;s in distress and that shareholders won&amp;#39;t get the value of the company&amp;#39;s assets, so that&amp;#39;s a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Microsoft&amp;#39;s yield is low. But it&amp;#39;s growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one denies that companies need to retain &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company&amp;#39;s cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I'm normally an index funds kinda guy. 

My research suggests there are a few things I can do:

**Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.**

Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: 

* limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. 
* pay taxes -&gt; less to reinvest. 


**Buy protective puts**

Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren't free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. 

**Set a trailing stop loss**
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it's easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. 

So my questions are: are there other options I didn't consider?  Which of these is best if I am long term bullish on these stocks?

TL;DR Does having more investors than ever before and faster opportunities for companies to grow account for the “outrageous multiples” we see?

I believe the average PE of the S&amp;P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don’t need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

I think my story and situation are quite unique. I got unlucky a bunch of times, and got really lucky a couple of times.

Most of all the good stuff happened in the last couple of years, before then I was just building and stressing stressing stressing.

I’d love some advice on what my next steps could/should be, and why.

I know I’m in a very fortuitous position, and I want to make sure I’m doing all I can to maximize my good fortune.

My current ‘snapshot’ is as follows. All numbers converted to USD.

----

**Monthy passive income:** 
Approximately $120-140k gross, of which maybe 20-25% is post-tax income/profit. This will run till about the end of 2025. With no changes or lateral moves, this 120-140 will go down to around 20-25 from say 2025/26 onward.

**Investments:** 

$50k in a tech startup that has unicorn potential

$15k in crypto (worth around 9k now lol)

$20-30k in other miscellaneous ventures/startups

**Assets:** 
Not a lot to speak of, just the businesses I’m currently operating/overseeing with a few new startups/projects in very early stages sprinkled in. No real estate, no property, no car. Renting a flat for a very good price. 

Approx $700k cash post-tax profit in corporate accounts. Will still need to move this into personal, but there’s a plan in place for that (low TR).

Approx $150k in cash. I know, it’s way too much to have in cash.

**Debt:** 0

**Monthly spend/burn:** $1500-2000. Yeah...I live very frugally, partly by coincidence and the rest by design.

No kids, no wife, no dependants. Family in EU, Canada and Mexico.

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthy passive income:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Approximately $120-140k gross, of which maybe 20-25% is post-tax income/profit. This will run till about the end of 2025. With no changes or lateral moves, this 120-140 will go down to around 20-25 from say 2025/26 onward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investments:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$50k in a tech startup that has unicorn potential&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$15k in crypto (worth around 9k now lol)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$20-30k in other miscellaneous ventures/startups&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assets:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Not a lot to speak of, just the businesses I’m currently operating/overseeing with a few new startups/projects in very early stages sprinkled in. No real estate, no property, no car. Renting a flat for a very good price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approx $700k cash post-tax profit in corporate accounts. Will still need to move this into personal, but there’s a plan in place for that (low TR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approx $150k in cash. I know, it’s way too much to have in cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debt:&lt;/strong&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly spend/burn:&lt;/strong&gt; $1500-2000. Yeah...I live very frugally, partly by coincidence and the rest by design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No kids, no wife, no dependants. Family in EU, Canada and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&amp;#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|120|5|25|
|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.

513,investing,"I saved up about a six month emergency fund which I have sitting in a money market account. But as I've started to accumulate more money in a market index fund I have been wondering if keeping any money in a money market account makes sense so long as you have enough extra in stocks. The worst that can happen is that the market goes down right when I need the emergency fund, which could certainly happen together in an economic downturn. In that case I'd essentially be paying more for using the emergency fund.

Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I'd basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. 

So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.

Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I'm not considering?

&gt;**He has the power to wipe out the entire human race. If we believe there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.**

In financial planning, this is truer than ever. So many ""30-year"" projections all make massive assumptions. That 6-months of emergency funds will be enough. That interest rates on bonds will be ""safe"" (not anymore they're not). That real-estate will appreciate. That social security will be there for you. That the government won't default etc etc.

Often, people glibly dismiss worse-case scenarios saying *""Well, if that happens, you'll have bigger things to worry about""*. No, I fucking won't! The government can default, but my first concern will be protecting my finances.

So what am I preparing for? **I don't know.** I have no idea what to prepare for.

What is my long-term horizon? I don't know

When will I retire? **I don't know**

For how long will I live? **I don't know**

How much money will I need? **I don't know**

I have no idea what will go wrong, or when.

So I thought I'll share six things I do to prepare for the worst.

**Keep $200k in Cash Equivalents**

People often recommend a ""6-month"" emergency fund. As if life's major problems will only last 6-months. What if you get disabled? What if your entire job industry vanishes, and you're unemployed for six years?

So I keep a 75/25 stock/cash portfolio allocation.

More importantly, I can't even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.

**Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only**

I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I'll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.

Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it's not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.

Always assume that you're going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.

**A Strong Value Tilt**

In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post [in defense of dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/), so I won't rehash my arguments here. I'll add only this - dividends aren't enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.

In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the [Gordon equation](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808).

**Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me**

If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don't want complications at the worst possible time.

**Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife**

A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I [posted about it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/) :) . It's not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.

But in case I'm persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can *maybe* bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.

**No House - Rent Only**

A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don't know what kind of tenants you'll get. Too much risk.

Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.

Bottom line: Always assume that everything will fall apart. If it doesn't, it's a pleasant surprise. But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a quote in Batman v Superman, where Bruce Wayne tells Alfred this about Superman:&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't pick Schwab and I don't known anything about that company except it wants to scoop up my account.

&lt;p&gt;I called Ameritrade this morning and the help desk said I have until Aug. 18th to move it to Schwab. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t pick Schwab and I don&amp;#39;t known anything about that company except it wants to scoop up my account. People who know more than I do about investing say it&amp;#39;s not the greatest platform and kind of clunky compared to Ameritrade (which I really liked - very good service, nice people, quick response. I was very satisfied). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a better place to put my IRA? If I select another firm (not Schwab) is there a charge to move my someplace else? How does that work? Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

Interested to see if there is any research out there that could suggest active trading beats B&amp;H. 

I've done some small backtesting on a few hundred trades that I thought I had identified as non-random movements, and even still the win % only really comes out to about 54% with a 1:1 Risk reward ratio. 

Theoretically, that has positive expected value, however, due to randomness, and the win % not being high enough, you are basically jsut chopping around and maybe making a few % points here and there on the most likely run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Again, this was just some small testing I personally did but everything in my view doesn't really hold up to simple B&amp;H over the long run. 

With that being said, I was interested in seeing if there is research out there comparing buy and hold to active management / active trading over a large enough data set and if there is potentially above what you would normally get by just buying a Vanguard index fund. 

Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it's because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I've made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same. You are basically around break even, + or - a few % points over enough trade samples.

So using $5000 in total, I get $10.49\*52=$545 annually. This is more than 10%!!

&lt;p&gt;Hilarious 12 million assets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than 1 million in cash!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description of the company is that it&amp;#39;s involved in all kind of investments, but if this is true why it&amp;#39;s missing from the balance sheet? How one could make venture capital level investments with less than 1 million of cash? Somehow the stock price was 5% up in Friday...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are all of the stockowners bag holders with the most massive bags one could imagine? I must be missing something here. Usually venture capital firms are private. If this one is not sharing ANY assets/profits/dividends/cash with it&amp;#39;s public shareholders why is it publicly traded and why would anyone put their money in it, let alone $4 billion? Shouldn&amp;#39;t this type of investing be done via private equity ownership?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that it has a subsidiary PowerTap Hydrogen Fueling Corp, but this isn&amp;#39;t helping as the subsidiary isn&amp;#39;t traded public. Besides shouldn&amp;#39;t this ownership be reflected on the balance sheet or it&amp;#39;s not how accounting works?&lt;/p&gt;

Now suppose, in the first year, I made a **loss of $100k** on the futures contract as the the market crashed. The next year, the market recovered to the exact level where I started and I gained **$100k on the same futures contract.**

1) Due to marked-to-market accounting, will I be paying $0 on the loss the first year and roughly 25% taxes on this $100k gain at the end of the second year even though the market didn't really gain?

Edit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

Words won't hurt me :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start with, I&amp;#39;m 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22.

During liquidation, chances are that it&amp;#39;s in distress and that shareholders won&amp;#39;t get the value of the company&amp;#39;s assets, so that&amp;#39;s a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Microsoft&amp;#39;s yield is low. But it&amp;#39;s growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one denies that companies need to retain &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company&amp;#39;s cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my strategy, and I&amp;#39;m sticking to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: For those of you reaching out, worried about me being attacked here, don&amp;#39;t worry. I&amp;#39;m 41 years and a grown ass adult. Words won&amp;#39;t hurt me :)&lt;/p&gt;

I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I'm normally an index funds kinda guy. 

My research suggests there are a few things I can do:

**Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.**

Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: 

* limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. 
* pay taxes -&gt; less to reinvest. 


**Buy protective puts**

Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren't free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. 

**Set a trailing stop loss**
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it's easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. 

So my questions are: are there other options I didn't consider?  Which of these is best if I am long term bullish on these stocks? 

If I look at protective puts, how do I structure the put? Do I set the strike price at the current price? Somewhere slightly below? Above? Significantly? What kind of experiation date should I aim for? Months years?

I’m looking to roll over my previous Pretax 401k funds into this Roth 401k, and understand I will need to pay taxes on the funds. It is a low amount, so I’m not very worried about this.

TL;DR Does having more investors than ever before and faster opportunities for companies to grow account for the “outrageous multiples” we see?

I believe the average PE of the S&amp;P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don’t need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

With that in mind, I can’t help but think about the amount of new money that’s been brought in in the last 20 years as ease of access to investing, as well as financial savvy has grown. I mean look at the market cap of the US market here:

https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

Are we just in a new norm as a result of these things? I’m not saying the market isn’t overvalued but is it AS overvalued as analysts think or should we be adjusting our baselines?

606,investing,"Hi everyone. I’d love to ask some advice. I’m early 40s, based in europe. I began setting up passive income streams about 10 years ago, and have been in and out of brick and mortar businesses in that time as well. Recently got out of a restaurant…dear lord never again.

I think my story and situation are quite unique. I got unlucky a bunch of times, and got really lucky a couple of times. I don’t think I’ve been particularly responsible, just lucky, as I’ve taken huge risks, some of which panned out. Most of all the good stuff happened in the last couple of years, before then I was just building and stressing stressing stressing.

I’d love some advice on what my next steps could/should be, and why. I feel totally ‘outside’ the system and would like at least some part of my portfolio to be sensible and conventional, but I’d also like to hear about more aggressive/risky plays. I know I’m in a very fortuitous position, and I want to make sure I’m doing all I can to maximize my good fortune.

My current ‘snapshot’ is as follows. All numbers converted to USD.

----

**Monthy passive income:** 
Approximately $120-140k gross, of which maybe 20-25% is post-tax income/profit. This will run till about the end of 2025. With no changes or lateral moves, this 120-140 will go down to around 20-25 from say 2025/26 onward.

**Investments:** 

$50k in a tech startup that has unicorn potential

$15k in crypto (worth around 9k now lol)

$20-30k in other miscellaneous ventures/startups

**Assets:** 
Not a lot to speak of, just the businesses I’m currently operating/overseeing with a few new startups/projects in very early stages sprinkled in. No real estate, no property, no car. Renting a flat for a very good price. 

Approx $700k cash post-tax profit in corporate accounts. Will still need to move this into personal, but there’s a plan in place for that (low TR).

Approx $150k in cash. I know, it’s way too much to have in cash.

**Debt:** 0

**Monthly spend/burn:** $1500-2000. Yeah...I live very frugally, partly by coincidence and the rest by design.

No kids, no wife, no dependants. Family in EU, Canada and Mexico.

Can I just transfer the stock over to the ROTH IRA? Also, once I have maxed out the ROTH IRA what is the best move with the individual account?&lt;br/&gt;
Thank you for taking the time to read this, and please bear with me, I am completely new to this. Please let me know if you need any additional information. TYIA.&lt;/p&gt;

610,investing,"Hi all,

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&amp;#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|120|5|25|
|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.

I am 33M.  

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.  

I started getting more serious and doing a lot more research in the last year or so and have accepted my losses and sold off my bad investments.  I've now invested in a mix of growth/ETFs like VOO, SCHD, AAPL, and TSLA

Lately, I just feel like the ""safest"" and more guaranteed return on investments are CDs and T-Bills given the interest rates they are offering (5% - 5.5%). I am in the process of setting up a CD/T-Bills ladder where I'd have maturing CDs or T-Bills monthly starting later this year. 

Should I continue with this approach? I know the interest rates will fluctuate and may not always be high but I haven't seen any of my investments besides TSLA really take off (AAPL has done decent). As noted above, I actually lost a good amount in the past.  

Right now, my goal is to not think about it everyday and just have my money grow over time (I will not need the cash). Should I just put it all in VOO? Leave it in SPAXX? Or just continue the ladder strategy? Are there any risks I'm not considering?

613,investing,"I saved up about a six month emergency fund which I have sitting in a money market account. But as I've started to accumulate more money in a market index fund I have been wondering if keeping any money in a money market account makes sense so long as you have enough extra in stocks. The worst that can happen is that the market goes down right when I need the emergency fund, which could certainly happen together in an economic downturn. In that case I'd essentially be paying more for using the emergency fund.

Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I'd basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. 

So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.

Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I'm not considering?

&gt;**He has the power to wipe out the entire human race. If we believe there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.**

In financial planning, this is truer than ever. So many ""30-year"" projections all make massive assumptions. That 6-months of emergency funds will be enough. That interest rates on bonds will be ""safe"" (not anymore they're not). That real-estate will appreciate. That social security will be there for you. That the government won't default etc etc.

Often, people glibly dismiss worse-case scenarios saying *""Well, if that happens, you'll have bigger things to worry about""*. No, I fucking won't! The government can default, but my first concern will be protecting my finances.

So what am I preparing for? **I don't know.** I have no idea what to prepare for.

What is my long-term horizon? I don't know

When will I retire? **I don't know**

For how long will I live? **I don't know**

How much money will I need? **I don't know**

I have no idea what will go wrong, or when.

So I thought I'll share six things I do to prepare for the worst.

**Keep $200k in Cash Equivalents**

People often recommend a ""6-month"" emergency fund. As if life's major problems will only last 6-months. What if you get disabled? What if your entire job industry vanishes, and you're unemployed for six years?

So I keep a 75/25 stock/cash portfolio allocation.

More importantly, I can't even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.

**Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only**

I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I'll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.

Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it's not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.

Always assume that you're going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.

**A Strong Value Tilt**

In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post [in defense of dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/), so I won't rehash my arguments here. I'll add only this - dividends aren't enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.

In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the [Gordon equation](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808).

**Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me**

If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don't want complications at the worst possible time.

**Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife**

A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I [posted about it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/) :) . It's not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.

But in case I'm persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can *maybe* bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.

**No House - Rent Only**

A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don't know what kind of tenants you'll get. Too much risk.

Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.

But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a quote in Batman v Superman, where Bruce Wayne tells Alfred this about Superman:&lt;/p&gt;

I have saved up 1000 Euros as an initial investment and plan to contribute 200 Euros per month going forward. After doing some research, I am considering investing in a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. However, I have some questions and would love to hear your thoughts and advice:

	1.	Is now a good time to step into the market, given the current economic conditions and market trends?
	2.	Considering my age and long-term investment horizon, does investing in a 2x leveraged ETF make sense, or are there other investment strategies I should consider?
	3.	Should I go 100% in on the S&amp;P 500 2x leverage ETF, or would a diversified portfolio be a better approach?

Interested to see if there is any research out there that could suggest active trading beats B&amp;H. 

I've done some small backtesting on a few hundred trades that I thought I had identified as non-random movements, and even still the win % only really comes out to about 54% with a 1:1 Risk reward ratio. 

Theoretically, that has positive expected value, however, due to randomness, and the win % not being high enough, you are basically jsut chopping around and maybe making a few % points here and there on the most likely run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Again, this was just some small testing I personally did but everything in my view doesn't really hold up to simple B&amp;H over the long run. 

With that being said, I was interested in seeing if there is research out there comparing buy and hold to active management / active trading over a large enough data set and if there is potentially above what you would normally get by just buying a Vanguard index fund. 

Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it's because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I've made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same. You are basically around break even, + or - a few % points over enough trade samples. 

I don't see how you could ever outperform B&amp;H by actively trading.

I will use the commodity NATGAS as an example which is $2.69 (01-aug.-'23) and I use Etoro as platform.  
However, the question is a general question for all platforms I suppose:  
  
I see that if eg. today I open a short (CFD, 1x) of $1000,- I get a weekly fee of $10.49 indefinitely as long as my position does not hit stop loss.  
I can move my stop loss to $14.8 if I add another $4000,- to my position.  
So using $5000 in total, I get $10.49\*52=$545 annually. This is more than 10%!!  
  
Now, I get that if the price of NATGAS rises, I am in ''trouble'', but not as long as it stays under my SL. I could even put the fees I receive back into my position increasing the SL further over time whilst maintaining the $545 annual fee.  
If I look at the history of NATGAS (known for more than 25 years) it never reached $15,-  
  
I know that results from the past are no guarantees for the future but still it feels like a solid way to get $545 annually! Why isn't everyone doing this then...

So I've thought of opening an account with something like Fundrise or Crowdstreet. I think both of these have different options for accredited investors, which I'm not yet. If I do set up an account, it would be a pretty small portion of my portfolio- I'm thinking like maybe $100/month compared to currently I'm putting \~2-3k per month into ETFs

I'll try to be in depth without rambling. Hopefully I'm not breaking any rules.

I recently received 10k in backpay from the VA - after paying off my credit card, I have roughly 7k to invest lump sum.

Monthly, I'll have roughly 1500 to invest from my disability pay, with no taxable income due to being unable to work, so all into regular brokerage at schwab.

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I'm normally an index funds kinda guy. 

My research suggests there are a few things I can do:

**Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.**

Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: 

* limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. 
* pay taxes -&gt; less to reinvest. 


**Buy protective puts**

Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren't free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. 

**Set a trailing stop loss**
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it's easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. 

So my questions are: are there other options I didn't consider?  Which of these is best if I am long term bullish on these stocks? 

If I look at protective puts, how do I structure the put? Do I set the strike price at the current price? Somewhere slightly below? Above? Significantly? What kind of experiation date should I aim for? Months years? 

Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,
I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I&amp;#39;m normally an index funds kinda guy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research suggests there are a few things I can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay taxes -&amp;gt; less to reinvest. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy protective puts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren&amp;#39;t free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a trailing stop loss&lt;/strong&gt;
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it&amp;#39;s easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offering will help J&amp;amp;J move a step closer in its plan to spin off the unit and focus on its larger medical devices and pharmaceuticals businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

TL;DR Does having more investors than ever before and faster opportunities for companies to grow account for the “outrageous multiples” we see?

I believe the average PE of the S&amp;P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don’t need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

With that in mind, I can’t help but think about the amount of new money that’s been brought in in the last 20 years as ease of access to investing, as well as financial savvy has grown. I mean look at the market cap of the US market here:

https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

Are we just in a new norm as a result of these things? I’m not saying the market isn’t overvalued but is it AS overvalued as analysts think or should we be adjusting our baselines?

I think my story and situation are quite unique. I got unlucky a bunch of times, and got really lucky a couple of times. I don’t think I’ve been particularly responsible, just lucky, as I’ve taken huge risks, some of which panned out. Most of all the good stuff happened in the last couple of years, before then I was just building and stressing stressing stressing.

I’d love some advice on what my next steps could/should be, and why. I feel totally ‘outside’ the system and would like at least some part of my portfolio to be sensible and conventional, but I’d also like to hear about more aggressive/risky plays. I know I’m in a very fortuitous position, and I want to make sure I’m doing all I can to maximize my good fortune.

My current ‘snapshot’ is as follows. All numbers converted to USD.

----

**Monthy passive income:** 
Approximately $120-140k gross, of which maybe 20-25% is post-tax income/profit. This will run till about the end of 2025. With no changes or lateral moves, this 120-140 will go down to around 20-25 from say 2025/26 onward.

**Investments:** 

$50k in a tech startup that has unicorn potential

$15k in crypto (worth around 9k now lol)

$20-30k in other miscellaneous ventures/startups

**Assets:** 
Not a lot to speak of, just the businesses I’m currently operating/overseeing with a few new startups/projects in very early stages sprinkled in. No real estate, no property, no car. Renting a flat for a very good price. 

Approx $700k cash post-tax profit in corporate accounts. Will still need to move this into personal, but there’s a plan in place for that (low TR).

Approx $150k in cash. I know, it’s way too much to have in cash.

**Debt:** 0

**Monthly spend/burn:** $1500-2000. Yeah...I live very frugally, partly by coincidence and the rest by design.

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&amp;#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.

Although I'm no expert in the hospitality sector, I'd imagine there's a natural limit that consumers will pay for a coffee from a fast food chain, before they'll just go to say, Starbucks.

My question is, how do companies - particularly in this era of inflation - avoid overestimating their pricing power, and thus driving down sales with higher prices?

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.

713,investing,"I saved up about a six month emergency fund which I have sitting in a money market account. But as I've started to accumulate more money in a market index fund I have been wondering if keeping any money in a money market account makes sense so long as you have enough extra in stocks. The worst that can happen is that the market goes down right when I need the emergency fund, which could certainly happen together in an economic downturn. In that case I'd essentially be paying more for using the emergency fund.

Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I'd basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. 

So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.

Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I'm not considering?

&gt;**He has the power to wipe out the entire human race. If we believe there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.**

In financial planning, this is truer than ever. So many ""30-year"" projections all make massive assumptions. That 6-months of emergency funds will be enough. That interest rates on bonds will be ""safe"" (not anymore they're not). That real-estate will appreciate. That social security will be there for you. That the government won't default etc etc.

Often, people glibly dismiss worse-case scenarios saying *""Well, if that happens, you'll have bigger things to worry about""*. No, I fucking won't! The government can default, but my first concern will be protecting my finances.

So what am I preparing for? **I don't know.** I have no idea what to prepare for.

What is my long-term horizon? I don't know

When will I retire? **I don't know**

For how long will I live? **I don't know**

How much money will I need? **I don't know**

I have no idea what will go wrong, or when.

So I thought I'll share six things I do to prepare for the worst.

**Keep $200k in Cash Equivalents**

People often recommend a ""6-month"" emergency fund. As if life's major problems will only last 6-months. What if you get disabled? What if your entire job industry vanishes, and you're unemployed for six years?

So I keep a 75/25 stock/cash portfolio allocation.

More importantly, I can't even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.

**Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only**

I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I'll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.

Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it's not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.

Always assume that you're going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.

**A Strong Value Tilt**

In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post [in defense of dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/), so I won't rehash my arguments here. I'll add only this - dividends aren't enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.

In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the [Gordon equation](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808).

**Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me**

If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don't want complications at the worst possible time.

**Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife**

A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I [posted about it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/) :) . It's not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.

But in case I'm persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can *maybe* bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.

**No House - Rent Only**

A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don't know what kind of tenants you'll get. Too much risk.

Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.

Bottom line: Always assume that everything will fall apart. If it doesn't, it's a pleasant surprise. But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a quote in Batman v Superman, where Bruce Wayne tells Alfred this about Superman:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, I can&amp;#39;t even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I&amp;#39;ll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it&amp;#39;s not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always assume that you&amp;#39;re going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Strong Value Tilt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/""&gt;in defense of dividends&lt;/a&gt;, so I won&amp;#39;t rehash my arguments here. I&amp;#39;ll add only this - dividends aren&amp;#39;t enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the &lt;a href=""https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808""&gt;Gordon equation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don&amp;#39;t want complications at the worst possible time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/""&gt;posted about it on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; :) . It&amp;#39;s not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in case I&amp;#39;m persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No House - Rent Only&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don&amp;#39;t know what kind of tenants you&amp;#39;ll get. Too much risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Always assume that everything will fall apart. If it doesn&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s a pleasant surprise. But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi everyone! I am a 26-year-old male from the Netherlands, and I am looking to start investing in the stock market. I have saved up 1000 Euros as an initial investment and plan to contribute 200 Euros per month going forward. After doing some research, I am considering investing in a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. However, I have some questions and would love to hear your thoughts and advice:

	1.	Is now a good time to step into the market, given the current economic conditions and market trends?
	2.	Considering my age and long-term investment horizon, does investing in a 2x leveraged ETF make sense, or are there other investment strategies I should consider?
	3.	Should I go 100% in on the S&amp;P 500 2x leverage ETF, or would a diversified portfolio be a better approach?
	4.	What are the potential risks and rewards of investing in a 2x leveraged ETF, and how can I best manage those risks?

       -choosing Roth because my 2023 income will be lower than 2024 due to starting midway this year (will switch to traditional starting 2024)
       -Rollover my Roth 401k to my Roth IRA if I switch jobs
- put anything leftover into VMFXX

Interested to see if there is any research out there that could suggest active trading beats B&amp;H. 

I've done some small backtesting on a few hundred trades that I thought I had identified as non-random movements, and even still the win % only really comes out to about 54% with a 1:1 Risk reward ratio. 

Theoretically, that has positive expected value, however, due to randomness, and the win % not being high enough, you are basically jsut chopping around and maybe making a few % points here and there on the most likely run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Again, this was just some small testing I personally did but everything in my view doesn't really hold up to simple B&amp;H over the long run. 

With that being said, I was interested in seeing if there is research out there comparing buy and hold to active management / active trading over a large enough data set and if there is potentially above what you would normally get by just buying a Vanguard index fund. 

Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it's because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I've made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same. You are basically around break even, + or - a few % points over enough trade samples. 

I don't see how you could ever outperform B&amp;H by actively trading.

751,investing,"Hi I have a (perhaps newby) question about shorting.  
  
I will use the commodity NATGAS as an example which is $2.69 (01-aug.-'23) and I use Etoro as platform.  
However, the question is a general question for all platforms I suppose:  
  
I see that if eg. today I open a short (CFD, 1x) of $1000,- I get a weekly fee of $10.49 indefinitely as long as my position does not hit stop loss.  
I can move my stop loss to $14.8 if I add another $4000,- to my position.  
So using $5000 in total, I get $10.49\*52=$545 annually. This is more than 10%!!  
  
Now, I get that if the price of NATGAS rises, I am in ''trouble'', but not as long as it stays under my SL. I could even put the fees I receive back into my position increasing the SL further over time whilst maintaining the $545 annual fee.  
If I look at the history of NATGAS (known for more than 25 years) it never reached $15,-  
  
I know that results from the past are no guarantees for the future but still it feels like a solid way to get $545 annually! Why isn't everyone doing this then...

I'll try to be in depth without rambling. Hopefully I'm not breaking any rules.

I recently received 10k in backpay from the VA - after paying off my credit card, I have roughly 7k to invest lump sum.

Monthly, I'll have roughly 1500 to invest from my disability pay, with no taxable income due to being unable to work, so all into regular brokerage at schwab.

I have no immediate plans nor expenses, but do plan to move within the next year. My risk tolerance is relatively high, but not high enough for individual stocks.

Here lies my plan, and the questions that follow: dump all 7k into VT, then take the 1500 and divide it into thirds to invest into:

VT/SCHB/BND

Is there any significant difference between doing the above three and doing VT/SWTSX/SWAGX? And, since my investments have to go into my taxable account, are bonds even worth it at that point?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

789,investing,"To start with, I'm 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22. Right now, my portfolio is just around a million dollars - still waiting to get a $87k tax refund from the government. Here's a screenshot of my portfolio:

[https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg)

Edit: The portfolio total is in Canadian dollars. So convert US holdings like SCHD, VOO, IBTG etc from USD to CAD, and the total should add up.

Edit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

Edit: For those of you reaching out, worried about me being attacked here, don't worry. I'm 41 years and a grown ass adult. Words won't hurt me :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start with, I&amp;#39;m 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22. Right now, my portfolio is just around a million dollars - still waiting to get a $87k tax refund from the government. Here&amp;#39;s a screenshot of my portfolio:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: The portfolio total is in Canadian dollars. So convert US holdings like SCHD, VOO, IBTG etc from USD to CAD, and the total should add up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: You&amp;#39;ll see that I&amp;#39;m not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I&amp;#39;m not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about &amp;quot;young&amp;quot; investors chasing dividends: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;m not exactly old, I&amp;#39;m not exactly young either. And here&amp;#39;s why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Arguments for Dividends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No investor thinks that dividends are &amp;quot;free money&amp;quot;. Obviously money doesn&amp;#39;t grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a &amp;quot;gotcha&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company&amp;#39;s assets. So let&amp;#39;s get that out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a fundamental level, I don&amp;#39;t care about stock prices. I care about only two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) What is my income stream?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) How fast is that income stream growing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person&amp;#39;s wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here&amp;#39;s a quote from Great Expectations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book &amp;quot;The Four Pillars of Investing&amp;quot;, Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I don&amp;#39;t care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you&amp;#39;re poor. At least for me. Doesn&amp;#39;t matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Dividends ARE From a Company&amp;#39;s Earnings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don&amp;#39;t use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn&amp;#39;t hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the big one. The theory goes that companies that don&amp;#39;t pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn&amp;#39;t want that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. &lt;strong&gt;That money was yours&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#39;s human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a company to retain dividends, they need to &lt;em&gt;generate a higher return than their own current cashflow&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they&amp;#39;re promising that they&amp;#39;ll get even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that&amp;#39;s your gamble to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you re-invest your dividends, you&amp;#39;re purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven &lt;strong&gt;they can already generate&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#39;s not pie-in-the-sky &amp;quot;trust me bro&amp;quot; cashflow. You know the company&amp;#39;s track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You&amp;#39;re buying more of the same. It&amp;#39;s more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English used to have a saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It&amp;#39;s stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. When a Company Fails, All You&amp;#39;re Left with is Dividends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it&amp;#39;s in distress and that shareholders won&amp;#39;t get the value of the company&amp;#39;s assets, so that&amp;#39;s a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Microsoft&amp;#39;s yield is low. But it&amp;#39;s growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one denies that companies need to retain &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company&amp;#39;s cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I'm normally an index funds kinda guy. 

My research suggests there are a few things I can do:

**Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.**

Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: 

* limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. 
* pay taxes -&gt; less to reinvest. 


**Buy protective puts**

Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren't free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. 

**Set a trailing stop loss**
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it's easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. 

So my questions are: are there other options I didn't consider?  Which of these is best if I am long term bullish on these stocks?

TL;DR Does having more investors than ever before and faster opportunities for companies to grow account for the “outrageous multiples” we see?

I believe the average PE of the S&amp;P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don’t need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

I think my story and situation are quite unique. I got unlucky a bunch of times, and got really lucky a couple of times.

Most of all the good stuff happened in the last couple of years, before then I was just building and stressing stressing stressing.

I’d love some advice on what my next steps could/should be, and why.

I know I’m in a very fortuitous position, and I want to make sure I’m doing all I can to maximize my good fortune.

My current ‘snapshot’ is as follows. All numbers converted to USD.

----

**Monthy passive income:** 
Approximately $120-140k gross, of which maybe 20-25% is post-tax income/profit. This will run till about the end of 2025. With no changes or lateral moves, this 120-140 will go down to around 20-25 from say 2025/26 onward.

**Investments:** 

$50k in a tech startup that has unicorn potential

$15k in crypto (worth around 9k now lol)

$20-30k in other miscellaneous ventures/startups

**Assets:** 
Not a lot to speak of, just the businesses I’m currently operating/overseeing with a few new startups/projects in very early stages sprinkled in. No real estate, no property, no car. Renting a flat for a very good price. 

Approx $700k cash post-tax profit in corporate accounts. Will still need to move this into personal, but there’s a plan in place for that (low TR).

Approx $150k in cash. I know, it’s way too much to have in cash.

**Debt:** 0

**Monthly spend/burn:** $1500-2000. Yeah...I live very frugally, partly by coincidence and the rest by design.

No kids, no wife, no dependants. Family in EU, Canada and Mexico.

&lt;p&gt;My current ‘snapshot’ is as follows. All numbers converted to USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthy passive income:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Approximately $120-140k gross, of which maybe 20-25% is post-tax income/profit. This will run till about the end of 2025. With no changes or lateral moves, this 120-140 will go down to around 20-25 from say 2025/26 onward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investments:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$50k in a tech startup that has unicorn potential&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$15k in crypto (worth around 9k now lol)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$20-30k in other miscellaneous ventures/startups&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assets:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Not a lot to speak of, just the businesses I’m currently operating/overseeing with a few new startups/projects in very early stages sprinkled in. No real estate, no property, no car. Renting a flat for a very good price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approx $700k cash post-tax profit in corporate accounts. Will still need to move this into personal, but there’s a plan in place for that (low TR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approx $150k in cash. I know, it’s way too much to have in cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debt:&lt;/strong&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly spend/burn:&lt;/strong&gt; $1500-2000. Yeah...I live very frugally, partly by coincidence and the rest by design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No kids, no wife, no dependants. Family in EU, Canada and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything at all you guys can offer would be interesting to read. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

810,investing,"Hi all,

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&amp;#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|120|5|25|
|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.

813,investing,"I saved up about a six month emergency fund which I have sitting in a money market account. But as I've started to accumulate more money in a market index fund I have been wondering if keeping any money in a money market account makes sense so long as you have enough extra in stocks. The worst that can happen is that the market goes down right when I need the emergency fund, which could certainly happen together in an economic downturn. In that case I'd essentially be paying more for using the emergency fund.

Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I'd basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. 

So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.

Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I'm not considering?

&gt;**He has the power to wipe out the entire human race. If we believe there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.**

In financial planning, this is truer than ever. So many ""30-year"" projections all make massive assumptions. That 6-months of emergency funds will be enough. That interest rates on bonds will be ""safe"" (not anymore they're not). That real-estate will appreciate. That social security will be there for you. That the government won't default etc etc.

Often, people glibly dismiss worse-case scenarios saying *""Well, if that happens, you'll have bigger things to worry about""*. No, I fucking won't! The government can default, but my first concern will be protecting my finances.

So what am I preparing for? **I don't know.** I have no idea what to prepare for.

What is my long-term horizon? I don't know

When will I retire? **I don't know**

For how long will I live? **I don't know**

How much money will I need? **I don't know**

I have no idea what will go wrong, or when.

So I thought I'll share six things I do to prepare for the worst.

**Keep $200k in Cash Equivalents**

People often recommend a ""6-month"" emergency fund. As if life's major problems will only last 6-months. What if you get disabled? What if your entire job industry vanishes, and you're unemployed for six years?

So I keep a 75/25 stock/cash portfolio allocation.

More importantly, I can't even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.

**Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only**

I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I'll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.

Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it's not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.

Always assume that you're going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.

**A Strong Value Tilt**

In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post [in defense of dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/), so I won't rehash my arguments here. I'll add only this - dividends aren't enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.

In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the [Gordon equation](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808).

**Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me**

If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don't want complications at the worst possible time.

**Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife**

A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I [posted about it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/) :) . It's not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.

But in case I'm persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can *maybe* bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.

**No House - Rent Only**

A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don't know what kind of tenants you'll get. Too much risk.

Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.

Bottom line: Always assume that everything will fall apart. If it doesn't, it's a pleasant surprise. But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a quote in Batman v Superman, where Bruce Wayne tells Alfred this about Superman:&lt;/p&gt;

Why would I want to transfer there?  What might be a better place to put a relatively modest (under $25K) IRA account (It is not a Roth)? 

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As most of you know Ameritrade has been sold to Schwab. I closed my trading account with Ameritrade today, but I still have my IRA there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called Ameritrade this morning and the help desk said I have until Aug. 18th to move it to Schwab. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t pick Schwab and I don&amp;#39;t known anything about that company except it wants to scoop up my account. People who know more than I do about investing say it&amp;#39;s not the greatest platform and kind of clunky compared to Ameritrade (which I really liked - very good service, nice people, quick response. I was very satisfied). &lt;/p&gt;

Interested to see if there is any research out there that could suggest active trading beats B&amp;H. 

I've done some small backtesting on a few hundred trades that I thought I had identified as non-random movements, and even still the win % only really comes out to about 54% with a 1:1 Risk reward ratio. 

Theoretically, that has positive expected value, however, due to randomness, and the win % not being high enough, you are basically jsut chopping around and maybe making a few % points here and there on the most likely run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Again, this was just some small testing I personally did but everything in my view doesn't really hold up to simple B&amp;H over the long run. 

With that being said, I was interested in seeing if there is research out there comparing buy and hold to active management / active trading over a large enough data set and if there is potentially above what you would normally get by just buying a Vanguard index fund. 

Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it's because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I've made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same. You are basically around break even, + or - a few % points over enough trade samples.

&lt;p&gt;Hilarious 12 million assets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than 1 million in cash!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description of the company is that it&amp;#39;s involved in all kind of investments, but if this is true why it&amp;#39;s missing from the balance sheet? How one could make venture capital level investments with less than 1 million of cash? Somehow the stock price was 5% up in Friday...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are all of the stockowners bag holders with the most massive bags one could imagine? I must be missing something here. Usually venture capital firms are private. If this one is not sharing ANY assets/profits/dividends/cash with it&amp;#39;s public shareholders why is it publicly traded and why would anyone put their money in it, let alone $4 billion? Shouldn&amp;#39;t this type of investing be done via private equity ownership?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that it has a subsidiary PowerTap Hydrogen Fueling Corp, but this isn&amp;#39;t helping as the subsidiary isn&amp;#39;t traded public. Besides shouldn&amp;#39;t this ownership be reflected on the balance sheet or it&amp;#39;s not how accounting works?&lt;/p&gt;

Now suppose, in the first year, I made a **loss of $100k** on the futures contract as the the market crashed. The next year, the market recovered to the exact level where I started and I gained **$100k on the same futures contract.**

1) Due to marked-to-market accounting, will I be paying $0 on the loss the first year and roughly 25% taxes on this $100k gain at the end of the second year even though the market didn't really gain?

Edit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

Words won't hurt me :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start with, I&amp;#39;m 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22.

During liquidation, chances are that it&amp;#39;s in distress and that shareholders won&amp;#39;t get the value of the company&amp;#39;s assets, so that&amp;#39;s a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Microsoft&amp;#39;s yield is low. But it&amp;#39;s growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one denies that companies need to retain &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company&amp;#39;s cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my strategy, and I&amp;#39;m sticking to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: For those of you reaching out, worried about me being attacked here, don&amp;#39;t worry. I&amp;#39;m 41 years and a grown ass adult. Words won&amp;#39;t hurt me :)&lt;/p&gt;

I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I'm normally an index funds kinda guy. 

My research suggests there are a few things I can do:

**Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.**

Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: 

* limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. 
* pay taxes -&gt; less to reinvest. 


**Buy protective puts**

Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren't free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. 

**Set a trailing stop loss**
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it's easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. 

So my questions are: are there other options I didn't consider?  Which of these is best if I am long term bullish on these stocks? 

If I look at protective puts, how do I structure the put? Do I set the strike price at the current price? Somewhere slightly below? Above? Significantly? What kind of experiation date should I aim for? Months years?

I’m looking to roll over my previous Pretax 401k funds into this Roth 401k, and understand I will need to pay taxes on the funds. It is a low amount, so I’m not very worried about this.

TL;DR Does having more investors than ever before and faster opportunities for companies to grow account for the “outrageous multiples” we see?

I believe the average PE of the S&amp;P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don’t need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

With that in mind, I can’t help but think about the amount of new money that’s been brought in in the last 20 years as ease of access to investing, as well as financial savvy has grown. I mean look at the market cap of the US market here:

https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

Are we just in a new norm as a result of these things? I’m not saying the market isn’t overvalued but is it AS overvalued as analysts think or should we be adjusting our baselines?

906,investing,"Hi everyone. I’d love to ask some advice. I’m early 40s, based in europe. I began setting up passive income streams about 10 years ago, and have been in and out of brick and mortar businesses in that time as well. Recently got out of a restaurant…dear lord never again.

I think my story and situation are quite unique. I got unlucky a bunch of times, and got really lucky a couple of times. I don’t think I’ve been particularly responsible, just lucky, as I’ve taken huge risks, some of which panned out. Most of all the good stuff happened in the last couple of years, before then I was just building and stressing stressing stressing.

I’d love some advice on what my next steps could/should be, and why. I feel totally ‘outside’ the system and would like at least some part of my portfolio to be sensible and conventional, but I’d also like to hear about more aggressive/risky plays. I know I’m in a very fortuitous position, and I want to make sure I’m doing all I can to maximize my good fortune.

My current ‘snapshot’ is as follows. All numbers converted to USD.

----

**Monthy passive income:** 
Approximately $120-140k gross, of which maybe 20-25% is post-tax income/profit. This will run till about the end of 2025. With no changes or lateral moves, this 120-140 will go down to around 20-25 from say 2025/26 onward.

**Investments:** 

$50k in a tech startup that has unicorn potential

$15k in crypto (worth around 9k now lol)

$20-30k in other miscellaneous ventures/startups

**Assets:** 
Not a lot to speak of, just the businesses I’m currently operating/overseeing with a few new startups/projects in very early stages sprinkled in. No real estate, no property, no car. Renting a flat for a very good price. 

Approx $700k cash post-tax profit in corporate accounts. Will still need to move this into personal, but there’s a plan in place for that (low TR).

Approx $150k in cash. I know, it’s way too much to have in cash.

**Debt:** 0

**Monthly spend/burn:** $1500-2000. Yeah...I live very frugally, partly by coincidence and the rest by design.

No kids, no wife, no dependants. Family in EU, Canada and Mexico.

Can I just transfer the stock over to the ROTH IRA? Also, once I have maxed out the ROTH IRA what is the best move with the individual account?&lt;br/&gt;
Thank you for taking the time to read this, and please bear with me, I am completely new to this. Please let me know if you need any additional information. TYIA.&lt;/p&gt;

910,investing,"Hi all,

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&amp;#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|120|5|25|
|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.

I am 33M.  

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.  

I started getting more serious and doing a lot more research in the last year or so and have accepted my losses and sold off my bad investments.  I've now invested in a mix of growth/ETFs like VOO, SCHD, AAPL, and TSLA

Lately, I just feel like the ""safest"" and more guaranteed return on investments are CDs and T-Bills given the interest rates they are offering (5% - 5.5%). I am in the process of setting up a CD/T-Bills ladder where I'd have maturing CDs or T-Bills monthly starting later this year. 

Should I continue with this approach? I know the interest rates will fluctuate and may not always be high but I haven't seen any of my investments besides TSLA really take off (AAPL has done decent). As noted above, I actually lost a good amount in the past.  

Right now, my goal is to not think about it everyday and just have my money grow over time (I will not need the cash). Should I just put it all in VOO? Leave it in SPAXX? Or just continue the ladder strategy? Are there any risks I'm not considering?

913,investing,"I saved up about a six month emergency fund which I have sitting in a money market account. But as I've started to accumulate more money in a market index fund I have been wondering if keeping any money in a money market account makes sense so long as you have enough extra in stocks. The worst that can happen is that the market goes down right when I need the emergency fund, which could certainly happen together in an economic downturn. In that case I'd essentially be paying more for using the emergency fund.

Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I'd basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. 

So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.

Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I'm not considering?

&gt;**He has the power to wipe out the entire human race. If we believe there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.**

In financial planning, this is truer than ever. So many ""30-year"" projections all make massive assumptions. That 6-months of emergency funds will be enough. That interest rates on bonds will be ""safe"" (not anymore they're not). That real-estate will appreciate. That social security will be there for you. That the government won't default etc etc.

Often, people glibly dismiss worse-case scenarios saying *""Well, if that happens, you'll have bigger things to worry about""*. No, I fucking won't! The government can default, but my first concern will be protecting my finances.

So what am I preparing for? **I don't know.** I have no idea what to prepare for.

What is my long-term horizon? I don't know

When will I retire? **I don't know**

For how long will I live? **I don't know**

How much money will I need? **I don't know**

I have no idea what will go wrong, or when.

So I thought I'll share six things I do to prepare for the worst.

**Keep $200k in Cash Equivalents**

People often recommend a ""6-month"" emergency fund. As if life's major problems will only last 6-months. What if you get disabled? What if your entire job industry vanishes, and you're unemployed for six years?

So I keep a 75/25 stock/cash portfolio allocation.

More importantly, I can't even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.

**Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only**

I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I'll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.

Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it's not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.

Always assume that you're going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.

**A Strong Value Tilt**

In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post [in defense of dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/), so I won't rehash my arguments here. I'll add only this - dividends aren't enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.

In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the [Gordon equation](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808).

**Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me**

If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don't want complications at the worst possible time.

**Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife**

A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I [posted about it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/) :) . It's not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.

But in case I'm persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can *maybe* bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.

**No House - Rent Only**

A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don't know what kind of tenants you'll get. Too much risk.

Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.

But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a quote in Batman v Superman, where Bruce Wayne tells Alfred this about Superman:&lt;/p&gt;

I have saved up 1000 Euros as an initial investment and plan to contribute 200 Euros per month going forward. After doing some research, I am considering investing in a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. However, I have some questions and would love to hear your thoughts and advice:

	1.	Is now a good time to step into the market, given the current economic conditions and market trends?
	2.	Considering my age and long-term investment horizon, does investing in a 2x leveraged ETF make sense, or are there other investment strategies I should consider?
	3.	Should I go 100% in on the S&amp;P 500 2x leverage ETF, or would a diversified portfolio be a better approach?

Interested to see if there is any research out there that could suggest active trading beats B&amp;H. 

I've done some small backtesting on a few hundred trades that I thought I had identified as non-random movements, and even still the win % only really comes out to about 54% with a 1:1 Risk reward ratio. 

Theoretically, that has positive expected value, however, due to randomness, and the win % not being high enough, you are basically jsut chopping around and maybe making a few % points here and there on the most likely run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Again, this was just some small testing I personally did but everything in my view doesn't really hold up to simple B&amp;H over the long run. 

With that being said, I was interested in seeing if there is research out there comparing buy and hold to active management / active trading over a large enough data set and if there is potentially above what you would normally get by just buying a Vanguard index fund. 

Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it's because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I've made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same. You are basically around break even, + or - a few % points over enough trade samples. 

I don't see how you could ever outperform B&amp;H by actively trading.

I will use the commodity NATGAS as an example which is $2.69 (01-aug.-'23) and I use Etoro as platform.  
However, the question is a general question for all platforms I suppose:  
  
I see that if eg. today I open a short (CFD, 1x) of $1000,- I get a weekly fee of $10.49 indefinitely as long as my position does not hit stop loss.  
I can move my stop loss to $14.8 if I add another $4000,- to my position.  
So using $5000 in total, I get $10.49\*52=$545 annually. This is more than 10%!!  
  
Now, I get that if the price of NATGAS rises, I am in ''trouble'', but not as long as it stays under my SL. I could even put the fees I receive back into my position increasing the SL further over time whilst maintaining the $545 annual fee.  
If I look at the history of NATGAS (known for more than 25 years) it never reached $15,-  
  
I know that results from the past are no guarantees for the future but still it feels like a solid way to get $545 annually! Why isn't everyone doing this then...

So I've thought of opening an account with something like Fundrise or Crowdstreet. I think both of these have different options for accredited investors, which I'm not yet. If I do set up an account, it would be a pretty small portion of my portfolio- I'm thinking like maybe $100/month compared to currently I'm putting \~2-3k per month into ETFs

I'll try to be in depth without rambling. Hopefully I'm not breaking any rules.

I recently received 10k in backpay from the VA - after paying off my credit card, I have roughly 7k to invest lump sum.

Monthly, I'll have roughly 1500 to invest from my disability pay, with no taxable income due to being unable to work, so all into regular brokerage at schwab.

I have no immediate plans nor expenses, but do plan to move within the next year. My risk tolerance is relatively high, but not high enough for individual stocks.

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I'm normally an index funds kinda guy. 

My research suggests there are a few things I can do:

**Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.**

Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: 

* limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. 
* pay taxes -&gt; less to reinvest. 


**Buy protective puts**

Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren't free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. 

**Set a trailing stop loss**
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it's easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. 

So my questions are: are there other options I didn't consider?  Which of these is best if I am long term bullish on these stocks? 

If I look at protective puts, how do I structure the put? Do I set the strike price at the current price? Somewhere slightly below? Above? Significantly? What kind of experiation date should I aim for? Months years? 

Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,
I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I&amp;#39;m normally an index funds kinda guy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research suggests there are a few things I can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay taxes -&amp;gt; less to reinvest. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy protective puts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren&amp;#39;t free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a trailing stop loss&lt;/strong&gt;
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it&amp;#39;s easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. &lt;/p&gt;

I have the opportunity to buy into a small but growing company that is already generating 150k annual profit. It may not grow anymore for another year or 2 but is very stable. The owner is flexible and down to Earth, so I do not want to insult him with a bad offer, but i genuinely do not know what would be appropriate. I have 20k I'm willing to buy in for now. What % do you think is appropriate to ask for? My thought was 10% am I delusional or on par?

Edit: I appreciate everyone who actually answered the question asked. I am going to ask for 5%

It all seems legitimate, until the email that I recieved today:

&gt; Hi Virtuix Supporter,

&gt; The chance to become a Virtuix shareholder ends next week (August 10). That’s an exciting opportunity by itself, considering how fast we’re growing. But our investors also get exclusive discounts on Omni One and are first in line to get a system. The last chance to get these perks is August 10.

They're trying to rush people to invest. Rushing people to do anything is a big red flag. Even if they're not a scam, I think their product is going to flop. No one (for VR products, 35k people on the waitlist is tiny) is going to spend $33k on a VR treadmil. Facebook's VR headset is much more trusted and popular. What do you guys think about it?
