With interest rates high and only another 0.25% federal interest rate increase expected as inflation is reacting as expected, current new issues of Federal Home Loan Basers are  6.00% interest rate which are available to retail through most brokers in $1,000 bond increments.

TL;DR Does having more investors than ever before and faster opportunities for companies to grow account for the “outrageous multiples” we see?

I believe the average PE of the S&amp;P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don’t need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

With that in mind, I can’t help but think about the amount of new money that’s been brought in in the last 20 years as ease of access to investing, as well as financial savvy has grown. I mean look at the market cap of the US market here:

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

34,investing,"I saved up about a six month emergency fund which I have sitting in a money market account. But as I've started to accumulate more money in a market index fund I have been wondering if keeping any money in a money market account makes sense so long as you have enough extra in stocks. The worst that can happen is that the market goes down right when I need the emergency fund, which could certainly happen together in an economic downturn. In that case I'd essentially be paying more for using the emergency fund.

Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I'd basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. 

So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.

Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I'm not considering?

&lt;p&gt;Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I&amp;#39;d basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I&amp;#39;m not considering?&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;**He has the power to wipe out the entire human race. If we believe there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.**

In financial planning, this is truer than ever. So many ""30-year"" projections all make massive assumptions. That 6-months of emergency funds will be enough. That interest rates on bonds will be ""safe"" (not anymore they're not). That real-estate will appreciate. That social security will be there for you. That the government won't default etc etc.

Often, people glibly dismiss worse-case scenarios saying *""Well, if that happens, you'll have bigger things to worry about""*. No, I fucking won't! The government can default, but my first concern will be protecting my finances.

So what am I preparing for? **I don't know.** I have no idea what to prepare for.

What is my long-term horizon? I don't know

When will I retire? **I don't know**

For how long will I live? **I don't know**

How much money will I need? **I don't know**

I have no idea what will go wrong, or when.

So I thought I'll share six things I do to prepare for the worst.

**Keep $200k in Cash Equivalents**

People often recommend a ""6-month"" emergency fund. As if life's major problems will only last 6-months. What if you get disabled? What if your entire job industry vanishes, and you're unemployed for six years?

So I keep a 75/25 stock/cash portfolio allocation.

More importantly, I can't even imagine the things that can go wrong. Ideally, I want to have enough money to ride out the worst-case scenario in another low cost of living country for 20 years, without needing to touch my investments and be forced to sell.

**Short-Term Treasury Bonds Only**

I never have anything over 4-years maturity. Currently, I have a bunch of bonds maturing in 2026, and I'll renew them for a similar duration if I have to.

Long-term bonds are good in theory to reduce portfolio volatility, but they fail at the worst possible time. In other words, it's not enough to consider risk, but also when that risk occurs. At the worst possible time, long-term bonds will suddenly become correlated with equities and fall simultaneously.

Always assume that you're going to retire into a generational bear market last 15-years or more with high inflation. At such a time, long-term bonds will get clobbered along with equities. Cash and short-term bonds will be the only safe assets.

**A Strong Value Tilt**

In times of crises like in the bear market of 1966-1982, the value premium shines and finally emerges. I already made a post [in defense of dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15dnfnd/in_defense_of_dividends_on_a_million_portfolio/), so I won't rehash my arguments here. I'll add only this - dividends aren't enough. The idea is to select dividend growers with low debt and solid cashflow.

In other words, follow the advice of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein and invest using the [Gordon equation](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93808).

**Choose a Multinational Brokerage - IBKR for Me**

If you suddenly need to relocate to another country, choose a brokerage that has a global presence, so that you can easily transfer over your positions with minimum fuss. You don't want complications at the worst possible time.

**Keep two Gold Coins - One for me and one for my wife**

A year ago, I bought two gold coins - I [posted about it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/sjxls1/my_first_two_gold_coins/) :) . It's not for investing. Gold is a speculative asset - no cashflow.

But in case I'm persecuted and need to flee the country (any country), I can *maybe* bribe the border guards with gold. I have no idea why I might need to do this, but reality can surprise me, so who knows.

**No House - Rent Only**

A house is a huge liability. Never mind bad things happening to the house, but you might need to move to another country, laws can change, making it hard to sell your house and extract the money, or it might take too much time, or if you rent it out, then you don't know what kind of tenants you'll get. Too much risk.

Renting allows you to move to another place with minimum fuss.

Bottom line: Always assume that everything will fall apart. If it doesn't, it's a pleasant surprise. But preparing for the worst case scenario is absolutely essential.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a quote in Batman v Superman, where Bruce Wayne tells Alfred this about Superman:&lt;/p&gt;

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&amp;#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.

Hi everyone! I am a 26-year-old male from the Netherlands, and I am looking to start investing in the stock market. I have saved up 1000 Euros as an initial investment and plan to contribute 200 Euros per month going forward. After doing some research, I am considering investing in a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. However, I have some questions and would love to hear your thoughts and advice:

	1.	Is now a good time to step into the market, given the current economic conditions and market trends?
	2.	Considering my age and long-term investment horizon, does investing in a 2x leveraged ETF make sense, or are there other investment strategies I should consider?
	3.	Should I go 100% in on the S&amp;P 500 2x leverage ETF, or would a diversified portfolio be a better approach?
	4.	What are the potential risks and rewards of investing in a 2x leveraged ETF, and how can I best manage those risks?

I will use the commodity NATGAS as an example which is $2.69 (01-aug.-'23) and I use Etoro as platform.  
However, the question is a general question for all platforms I suppose:  
  
I see that if eg. today I open a short (CFD, 1x) of $1000,- I get a weekly fee of $10.49 indefinitely as long as my position does not hit stop loss.  
I can move my stop loss to $14.8 if I add another $4000,- to my position.  
So using $5000 in total, I get $10.49\*52=$545 annually. This is more than 10%!!  
  
Now, I get that if the price of NATGAS rises, I am in ''trouble'', but not as long as it stays under my SL. I could even put the fees I receive back into my position increasing the SL further over time whilst maintaining the $545 annual fee.  
If I look at the history of NATGAS (known for more than 25 years) it never reached $15,-  
  
I know that results from the past are no guarantees for the future but still it feels like a solid way to get $545 annually! Why isn't everyone doing this then...

Interested to see if there is any research out there that could suggest active trading beats B&amp;H. 

I've done some small backtesting on a few hundred trades that I thought I had identified as non-random movements, and even still the win % only really comes out to about 54% with a 1:1 Risk reward ratio. 

Theoretically, that has positive expected value, however, due to randomness, and the win % not being high enough, you are basically jsut chopping around and maybe making a few % points here and there on the most likely run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Again, this was just some small testing I personally did but everything in my view doesn't really hold up to simple B&amp;H over the long run. 

With that being said, I was interested in seeing if there is research out there comparing buy and hold to active management / active trading over a large enough data set and if there is potentially above what you would normally get by just buying a Vanguard index fund. 

Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it's because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I've made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same. You are basically around break even, + or - a few % points over enough trade samples. 

I don't see how you could ever outperform B&amp;H by actively trading. 

Anyways, interested in looking forward to the research if there is any.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done some small backtesting on a few hundred trades that I thought I had identified as non-random movements, and even still the win % only really comes out to about 54% with a 1:1 Risk reward ratio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, that has positive expected value, however, due to randomness, and the win % not being high enough, you are basically jsut chopping around and maybe making a few % points here and there on the most likely run of the Monte Carlo simulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this was just some small testing I personally did but everything in my view doesn&amp;#39;t really hold up to simple B&amp;amp;H over the long run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, I was interested in seeing if there is research out there comparing buy and hold to active management / active trading over a large enough data set and if there is potentially above what you would normally get by just buying a Vanguard index fund. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would love to hear some comments/thoughts on this because some people who I brought this up to who are active traders always seem to come back and say your analysis is wrong or it&amp;#39;s because of the way you tested your stop or your exit targets, but any method I&amp;#39;ve made adjustments to and tested on other datasets basically comes our relatively the same. You are basically around break even, + or - a few % points over enough trade samples. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see how you could ever outperform B&amp;amp;H by actively trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, interested in looking forward to the research if there is any. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

I'll try to be in depth without rambling. Hopefully I'm not breaking any rules.

I recently received 10k in backpay from the VA - after paying off my credit card, I have roughly 7k to invest lump sum.

Monthly, I'll have roughly 1500 to invest from my disability pay, with no taxable income due to being unable to work, so all into regular brokerage at schwab.

I have no immediate plans nor expenses, but do plan to move within the next year. My risk tolerance is relatively high, but not high enough for individual stocks.

Here lies my plan, and the questions that follow: dump all 7k into VT, then take the 1500 and divide it into thirds to invest into:

VT/SCHB/BND

Is there any significant difference between doing the above three and doing VT/SWTSX/SWAGX? And, since my investments have to go into my taxable account, are bonds even worth it at that point?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, I have a Roth IRA, and Simple IRA and a brokerage account through fidelity. I max out my IRAs and contribute leftover money monthly into my fidelity account. 

Emergency cash is parked in a HYSA and set for 6 months. 

Last night I took my current balances and compounded them at 8% for the next 25 years. I only gave the Roth IRA max contribution at the current limit, everything else I just let compound. 

I came out with a 1.7mil portfolio. Of course with taxes and what not that number will be a bit less.

In addition my wife is a government employee with a great retirement plan. 

Here is my dilemma…

I feel that I am “behind” and not putting enough away. Because of this I feel that I need to pour extra money monthly into my fidelity account. Sometimes stressing me out that I don’t “make” enough even though I can cover all of our bills and have money for hobbies, vacation, entertainment, etc.

I am not sure where this comes from and/or how to get in the right mindset with it.  

1.7mil will definitely not be enough to live off, but even with just investing in my Simple IRA and Roth I feel that the fidelity account is an added bonus and wondering if it’s work it versus living and enjoying the moment with that extra cash flow.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am 38 and am struggling to feel comfortable with my portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;

I have a pair of stocks that have increased since I bought them. GOOG by 60% and NVDA by 400%. I am still reasonably bulish about both companies but I want to protect myself in case things go south. I'm normally an index funds kinda guy. 

My research suggests there are a few things I can do:

**Sell some fraction (say 30%) of both and reinvest in index funds.**

Pros: guaranteed income, simple 
Cons: 

* limits growth if the stock does continue to go up. 
* pay taxes -&gt; less to reinvest. 


**Buy protective puts**

Pros: Protects you if things go well south. No tax impact. 
Cons: Premiums aren't free. Have to repeat this after every expiration. Forgetting means bad things. 

**Set a trailing stop loss**
It seems like folks are really bearish on this as it's easy to trigger it prematurely and miss out on gains. 

So my questions are: are there other options I didn't consider?  Which of these is best if I am long term bullish on these stocks? 

If I look at protective puts, how do I structure the put? Do I set the strike price at the current price? Somewhere slightly below? Above? Significantly? What kind of experiation date should I aim for? Months years?

Edit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about &amp;quot;young&amp;quot; investors chasing dividends: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;m not exactly old, I&amp;#39;m not exactly young either. And here&amp;#39;s why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Arguments for Dividends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No investor thinks that dividends are &amp;quot;free money&amp;quot;. Obviously money doesn&amp;#39;t grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a &amp;quot;gotcha&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company&amp;#39;s assets. So let&amp;#39;s get that out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a fundamental level, I don&amp;#39;t care about stock prices. I care about only two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) What is my income stream?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) How fast is that income stream growing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person&amp;#39;s wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here&amp;#39;s a quote from Great Expectations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book &amp;quot;The Four Pillars of Investing&amp;quot;, Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I don&amp;#39;t care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you&amp;#39;re poor. At least for me. Doesn&amp;#39;t matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Dividends ARE From a Company&amp;#39;s Earnings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don&amp;#39;t use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn&amp;#39;t hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the big one. The theory goes that companies that don&amp;#39;t pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn&amp;#39;t want that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. &lt;strong&gt;That money was yours&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#39;s human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a company to retain dividends, they need to &lt;em&gt;generate a higher return than their own current cashflow&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they&amp;#39;re promising that they&amp;#39;ll get even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that&amp;#39;s your gamble to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you re-invest your dividends, you&amp;#39;re purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven &lt;strong&gt;they can already generate&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#39;s not pie-in-the-sky &amp;quot;trust me bro&amp;quot; cashflow. You know the company&amp;#39;s track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You&amp;#39;re buying more of the same. It&amp;#39;s more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English used to have a saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It&amp;#39;s stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. When a Company Fails, All You&amp;#39;re Left with is Dividends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it&amp;#39;s in distress and that shareholders won&amp;#39;t get the value of the company&amp;#39;s assets, so that&amp;#39;s a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Microsoft&amp;#39;s yield is low. But it&amp;#39;s growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one denies that companies need to retain &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company&amp;#39;s cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my strategy, and I&amp;#39;m sticking to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: For those of you reaching out, worried about me being attacked here, don&amp;#39;t worry. I&amp;#39;m 41 years and a grown ass adult. Words won&amp;#39;t hurt me :)&lt;/p&gt;

131,investing,"I think dividend stocks are fundamentally misunderstood by the majority of investors. I (hopefully) imagine most people in r/investing already know dividend mechanics, but I often see a few common arguments on personal finance forums for dividend stocks.  


**(1)** Dividend stocks pay greater yields compared to T-Bills/bonds/GICs, which had low returns throughout the 2010s during the period of ZIRP and post-2020.  


**(2)** The income stream of dividend stocks is more “reliable” than depending on stock prices. Capital gains and losses fluctuate yearly, but dividend payouts are less variable.  


**(3)** The underlying stocks that pay dividends are thought to be more stable; most investors would consider that companies with excess cash to return in dividends, rather than invest in themselves, are in a safer financial position than growth.  


**(4)** Dividend companies are often (*and wrongly*) associated with “value”. Dividend stocks can and often do have low P/B, P/E, and often trade near book value, but this is not to say that all dividend stocks are priced in terms of value ([for example, PepsiCo at 33 P/E is equal to Apple](https://ycharts.com/companies/PEP/pe_ratio)).  


**(5)** An idea that dividends are “free money”, because you aren’t working for them. This is a very dangerous and flawed way of thinking for investments. For one, *dividends decrease retained earnings*. Two, you can still incur real losses when the underlying stock decreases more than your dividend payout. The fundamental risk-reward tradeoff exists for all investments, including dividend stocks.  


The mechanism of dividends is - at a simple level - fundamentally indifferent to selling stock; stock prices decrease exactly by the dividend payout on the ex-dividend date. [Buffett even argues](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2012ltr.pdf) that **forced dividend payouts are inferior** to letting shareholders decide their own cash-out policies from capital gain, rather than incurring immediate taxes from dividend income and purchasing stock above book value (which is why Berkshire doesn’t pay out dividends).  


Mental accounting is our tendency to sort our money into individual categories, rather than treat them homogeneously. Academics suggest that investors have a flawed mindset, so called the “*free dividend fallacy*” by Hartzmark and Solomon; investors and even mutual funds/institutions subconsciously see dividends and price decreases as fundamentally separate, despite their working knowledge. Individuals tend to treat the gains from dividends as separate from the concept of the share price, and analysts are overambitious when forecasting dividend-paying stocks (due to their negligence the fundamental link between dividends and the underlying stock).   


**Dividend demand increases during periods of low interest yields** \- which argues that investors *do* substitute the former for fixed income, despite the fact that they are **completely different asset classes**.  


*They argue that “... dividend irrelevance runs counter to intuitions from other areas of life, whereby harvesting the fruit from a tree is viewed as fundamentally different to harvesting the tree itself.*  


*”*Here is a quick exercise; remember that there are really no similarities between dividends and bonds. You cannot view the idea of cashflow of $10 from a $100 bond as equivalent to $10 from a $100 stock (which will always drop to $90). **There is no promise of dividend yield nor price security from dividends compared to bonds.** There goes the argument of dividends as a ""safe"" blend of equity and fixed income for retirement.  


I'm not sure why many people think that **dividends are earnings.**  


When a company sells down some assets, they often pay out the value as dividends, so taking only dividends is still depleting your asset base (book value of the stock decreases). Really, where the company obtains the dividend cash isn’t even relevant, whether from profit or assets - it was already part of the company’s assets.  


Companies pay out part of their income as share buybacks, so your dividends are again not representative of company earnings.  


Most importantly, **companies can pay out any amount of their earnings as dividends** (of course, even cutting them unexpectedly). The more they pay out, your retained earnings and business reinvestment, so your **expected earnings growth will be reduced by the dividend payout**. You’re not getting more of a return with a company that pays out a higher percentage of their earnings as dividends.**Dividends are not earnings.** And by not reinvesting your dividends (which is still taxed), you’re **directly drawing down** from your assets, and the **higher your dividend, the more you’re drawing down**.  


Modigliani-Miller’s dividend irrelevance theory isn’t completely applicable in real-life due to taxes (*it actually argues against dividends*), but even more so due to investor psychology. Really, this means that chasing high yields is simply increasing your inefficiency by having more of your income exposed to dividend taxation while the share price still decreases proportionally. Fundamentally, you’re still speculating on the company that pays dividends through future earnings.

A few arguments *for* dividends say that dividends are useful for companies with excess profit. Rather than potentially squandering it in unfruitful M&amp;A/investments by bad management, they would rather return the cash to shareholders (who should, in theory, be able to get greater returns through investing elsewhere). **This is without argument, a fact.**

But dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) into the same stock *doesn’t really compute*; you are both incurring more tax inefficiency by immediately realizing your gain (in the case you’re in a high-income bracket or simply don’t need the cash that year).

Saying that DRIP gives you the power of compound interest doesn’t even make sense either; DRIP or a company not paying out a dividend has the same outcome, and any asset with growth experiences compounding. It used to be hailed as a useful method of reinvestment because of commission-free purchases and at times - even discounts of around 2-3% on stock - but this is no longer relevant with modern brokerages and low trading costs. *The caveat is that it is still useful in registered accounts* (where it would be more inefficient to transfer money out rather than directly reinvest to your position).

Another stance is that dividend cashflow maintains a fixed percentage of shareholder ownership compared to selling off stock to substitute dividends; therefore reducing your ownership as a % over time. This holds no water either.Suppose you have two stocks under the condition of perpetual growth of 10%, one that pays its excess earnings in the form of dividends and the other that chooses to retain them (at the same growth rate of the company). Both are initially priced at $100. An investor who owns 1 share must sell 0.1 shares to match the first dividend payout of $10. To match the second dividend, he sells 0.091 shares (because his share price is now $110), to match the third, .083. After 50 dividends, they have 0.01031 shares left, but the share price is $9,700/share.

Eventually, your stock price approaches infinity while your shares sold per period nears 0%. Most investors likely aren’t proxy voting, so we can realistically brush aside those benefits; which are much less than that of the income tax drag you have realized on the way.

**Dividend Outperformance**  


Before you state that high-dividend yield stocks have [better returns than the S&amp;P 500 in the long run](https://www.tacitacapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/High-Dividend-Strategy-under-the-Microscope.pdf) \- which they have and may or may not do so in the future- consider that many of these companies are typically smaller in size (less than $5B) and in low-growth sectors (consumer staples/utilities/REITs). Why does this matter? Well, because of [as part of Fama/French’s 5 factor model](https://www.tacitacapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/High-Dividend-Strategy-under-the-Microscope.pdf). Historically, investing in value in-turn beat high-yield dividend strategies across global markets with higher risk adjusted returns. If that’s the case, then why not simply skip to the next best thing: value?  


**Gains are not Losses**  
Suppose that you argue that dividends are the key to keeping your investing habit stable; you enjoy seeing the consistent dividend cashflow come out of your account, leading you to continue your habit/motivation. Perhaps you are a follower prospect theory - which states that investors value gains and losses differently, with losses being more emotionally impactful. You prefer the (fairly) certain dividend, versus tracking the ups and downs of stock appreciation. Proponents of DRIP are reasonably happy in the long-term; they never perceive that dividend as entering their  “account” or “leaving” when it becomes reinvested. They see greater numbers of shares owned, less perceived losses (DCA in down periods, which reduces your average cost and subsequently your captain gain/loss).  


But what about those that don’t? Greed is a natural human instinct; there is no denying it. The implications for investing are huge; investors want to spend more now rather than save for the future. They pick and over allocate capital to income-producing assets due to a ""spend it today"" mindset, which is especially relevant if you perceive dividends as “excess” cash or spend it frivolously. In the long-term horizon, it’s likely you will miss out on substantial long-term wealth growth.  


This post is not to say that investing in dividend stocks is never a correct choice - far from so. I just wanted to address the misconceptions surrounding dividends that are spouted so often and how they're somehow a superior option.

The bottom line is your investing mindset - especially for young individuals or those with a long timeframe - should be to maximize your total returns, which is likely not in dividend-focused investments (and especially not in relation to yield chasing). If dividends are the factor that motivates you into saving more instead of traditional investing, then so be it; allocate a small portion to that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think dividend stocks are fundamentally misunderstood by the majority of investors.

IB charges 7% currently for a 200k margin which is a no-brainer based on the past returns (and conservative future returns).

&amp;#x200B;

Where will I be using it?

\- To do more of the same type of investing that I'm doing in my portfolio

\- To renovate the house and sell/flip it, and move to a bigger house and flip it ad infinitum

\- Perhaps spend it on the wife and parents and live a little :)

\- Start angel investing (my portfolio is a bit larger than 1 mm)

Thanks for the look

Stocks have shot up and are now much less attractive. After selling off for most of 2022, bonds have levelled off, but the yield curve remains strongly inverted, making T-bills more attractive than long duration bonds. Commodities have been selling off, have found a floor, and are pulling up, and as such are more attractive now. 

I'm now recommending commodities for a significant portion of your portfolio, if you have a high risk tolerance, followed by T-bills, followed by stocks, until they lose their momentum.

My analysis (which I keep updated) is here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing)

If you have a different quantitative leading indicator that you prefer, I'd be interested in trying it out.

**I use the following predictors / valuation measures:**

*Stocks:*

Jesse Livermore's Average Investor Equity Allocation (AIEA) has the best performance that I’ve found.

Briefly, AIEA is (Stocks Owned) / (Stocks + Bonds + Cash Owned) by the entire market. It can be thought of as a slow-moving fear/greed indicator, where higher values are greedy and lower values are fearful.

AIEA is discussed here: [https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/](https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/), and the raw data is available here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis).

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.87 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 1.29 +/- 2.5%.

Note that with this very low expected return and recent history, this looks like a classic bubble echo: [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Stages\_of\_a\_bubble.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Stages_of_a_bubble.png). We are in the Return to ""normal"" after the Bull Trap. I suspect that the stock market break down after inflation returns or GDP collapses. The more out-of-whack this valuation gets, the less it will take to pop.

*Bonds:*

The mechanism used for the model is that the bonds held are traded each month for new bonds at the new interest rate. This takes into account the effect of changing interest rates on the value of bonds held, but not taxes or fees. Coupon payments are reinvested. The given interest rate for the current ten year bond is a good (though not perfect) predictor for what the ten year return will be. The data comes from [http://www.econ.yale.edu/\~shiller/data/ie\_data.xls](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls)

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.86 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 4.07 +/- 2.0%

With the treasury yield curve being strongly inverted ([https://www.ustreasuryyieldcurve.com/b/7TLKAL](https://www.ustreasuryyieldcurve.com/b/7TLKAL)), you are not compensated for the significant inflation risk of buying long duration bonds. I recommend 2-6 month T-bills, which are currently yielding around 5.5%.

*Commodities:*

The best predictor that I found was GSCI/GDP. GSCI is S&amp;P’s commodity index, with records back to 1970 here: [https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gsci](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gsci). GDP is the U.S. gross domestic product, with data here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP). This implies that there is a natural level of investment in commodities, compared to GDP.

I find a historical R\^2 of 0.63 and a current expected 10 year CAGR of 14.95 +/- 10%. The high uncertainty here is largely because the correlation got markedly worse in 2005, around the time of global financial crisis. Commodities suffered a bubble and pop, with a peak in June of 2008. In addition to the demand fluctuation related to the global financial crisis, this was the time that massive oil and natural gas investment was occurring, which ended up crashing the prices until recently.

WTI Oil has an extremely hard resistance at $67, caused by the Saudis and the Americans defending the price (and possibly the Chinese), and has recently broken upwards out of its downward trend. As such, it looks very promising. However, because of the significant uncertainty in my quantitative analysis, I wouldn't recommend going all in in commodities.

**Back testing:**

I worked out an optimal back tested strategy ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing) \-&gt; Data sheet, toward the right). With this I find the following CAGRs, from January, 1970 to January, 2023.

Stocks only: 10.45%

Bonds only: 6.78%

Commodities only: 6.90%

Stock and Bonds: 12.21%

Stocks and Commodities and Bonds: 16.42%.

For each of these, I use the indicators from three months prior to the current date. This happens to give better results, as well as being possible without a time machine. I switch the entire portfolio to the best investment once a month, using the following procedure:

&amp;#x200B;

    if(stock return &gt; bond return + 0.8%) {
       if (stock return &gt; commodity return - 13.8%) {
          buy stocks
       } else {
          buy commodities
       }
    
    } else { 
        if (bond return &gt; commodity return + 0.5%) {
           buy bonds
       } else {
           buy commodities
       }
    }     

Predicted stock return = -0.65 \* AIEA+0.328

Predicted bond return = 0.0107 \* GS10 - 00161.

Predicted commodity return =  - 0.593 \* GSCI/GDP  + 0.226

Currently, this procedure recommends commodities.

**Actual Results:**

I've been doing this long enough, and posting about it to reddit long enough, that I can start to have a verified track record, as opposed to back testing only. This only includes what I posted to reddit, not what I've actually done with my portfolio, which is significantly more complicated and impossible to prove.

*March 2021, recommended stocks* [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/meu01j/bonds\_vs\_stocks\_and\_short\_term\_returns\_now\_is\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/meu01j/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_not/)

This is the default case, so no comment

*July 2021, recommended bonds* [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds\_vs\_stocks\_and\_short\_term\_returns\_now\_is\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_the/)

This performed much worse than I expected. I was correct that stocks were in danger. I made the faulty assumption that bonds are low risk. The combination of very low initial interest rates and the surprise (to me) very high inflation caused the worst bond sell off in US history. I did not see this coming.

*April 2022, recommended commodities* [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u64m1i/stocks\_vs\_bonds\_vs\_commodities/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u64m1i/stocks_vs_bonds_vs_commodities/)

This performed okay, I guess. But the recommendation was late (after Russian invaded Ukraine).

*October 2022, recommended stocks*
[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/yeigcu/stocks\_vs\_bonds\_vs\_commodities\_time\_to\_get\_more/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/yeigcu/stocks_vs_bonds_vs_commodities_time_to_get_more/)

My timing here was impeccable, and much better than most of the professionals that I follow.

In the table ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U2iBzClHLFp7IfvClkO7LLHVZXzBrmmSTeIHnFI5Ww/edit?usp=sharing) \-&gt; Reddit record), I'm shifting the dates one month later, to avoid any hint of look ahead bias.

Following my recommendations would have lead an account to rise from 100 to 102. Doing stocks alone would rise to 112. Bonds alone would fall to 86. Commodities alone would risen from 100 to 142. So my practical, reddit return is mediocre, primarily because of how badly I whiffed on the bonds recommendation. There was also some chasing the last good thing, with commodities. Using my current rules in a back test, the account would have risen from 100 to 144 (and been almost completely commodities till now).

**Warnings**

* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.
* AIEA measures a natural level for stock vs bond ownership. This is not a fundamental parameter, with an underlying theory about why the natural level should be where it is, or will remain the same in the future.
* Though GSCI/GDP feels like it could be fundamental parameter, it leaves out important phenomena, like the changing structure of the economy, as well as paradigm shifts in commodity extraction technology.
* I don't take into account taxes or other transaction costs.
* My analysis starts in 1970, because that is when the commodities data becomes available. This is a smaller data set than I ‘d like.
* I’m using the S&amp;P 500, 10 year US treasuries, and GSCI because they have long data sets, not because I consider them to be optimal investments.
* GSCI is dominated by the price of oil, like how the S&amp;P is dominated by a small number of mega tech companies, but even more so.
* My verifiable track record currently under performs VOO and chill.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of movement in markets in the last year, and it is time for an update. &lt;/p&gt;

138,investing,"TLDR: Swapping from Edward Jones to Schwab and looking for traditional IRA and other recommendations. \*Apologies for the following novel!

  
Hey folks, I am looking for some strategic advice. I started investing three years ago when I finished active-duty military service. My wife and I stupidly didn’t save or invest any money during my 20 years of service, so no IRAs or TSP starting off. We collectively were living paycheck-to-paycheck during my military service based on terrible spending habits.

  
In 2021 we sold a house which netted us around $150k. We bought another (at 2.499 interest) but put very little down because we used our VA loan and I wanted to feel the security of having cash on hand. We have kept the rest of the proceeds in the breakdown below. Not really knowing what I was doing, I opened accounts with Edward Jones and started throwing money at it. We were able to open the Roth's based on my income then, but have since become ineligible to add to those due to high income. Also, we bought all of the individual stocks and watched them plummet in 2022, but they have since recovered and we are basically back where we started.

  
Fast-forward to now, we still spend what I consider a ridiculous amount of money every month, but we are working to correct it and double-down on investing for retirement. I started working with a great company that does a 5% match with John Hancock, and I am maxing that contribution every year (about $20k) with 75% into RFHTX and 25% into the 500 Index Fund. I am not looking to change that allocation unless folks have a compelling recommendation. Additionally, we have roughly $5k/month that is unused (saved) and put in our normal bank savings account which is really giving us no return, about 60 dollars a month, so not really sure what to do there… I should note that I plan to work for at least the next 15-20 years and expect my current income level to remain static or increase.  


So my questions are:   
\-	As we are moving into Schwab, what index funds or ETFs would make the most sense for the Roth IRAs?  
\-	Should we be maxing out Traditional IRAs with the intent to do a backdoor conversion later?   
\-	What should be done with the cash that we have in our bank’s low-interest savings account?  
\-	Are we on track or do I need to make some drastic move like taking savings and paying off vehicles / dropping the savings into my mortgage to reduce it / other?  
  
One thought I have is to make the transition to Schwab and put the Roth’s/529s into whatever the advisor recommends. Then liquidating the $50,000 in individual stocks from EJ, put that money into a MMF with Schwab and use that money to fund Traditional IRAs for my wife and I. Would this be a smart move?  
  
Below are some of our financial stats:

Current take home (net) income: $20,000/mo  
\-	$12,000 from employment  
\-	$8,000 from military retirement &amp; VA disability

Discretionary spending: $5,000/mo  
Current 401k: $88,000

(Edward Jones) Kid’s 529s: $8,000 (although both kids have GI Bill, so won’t likely “need” the 529s)

164,investing,"Hi guys,

I am wondering if any of you have long/short portfolios (similar to hedge funds) and have some success with it. 

I have decent knowledge on investing/trading in general but never paid attention to hedging out market risk when building a portfolio, but I am quite interested in creating something like this as a side portfolio.

My thought is; i am going 200% long and 100% short (so double the long exposure compared to short) and instead of going short individual stocks, I am going short the market ETF (in my case DAX, Germany) and I will go long individual stocks (anywhere from 5 to 10). Since I have some experience in short term trading I am quite okay at predicting next 3 mnths out for small listed companies so I am planning to recycles these shares into new ones probably every earnings release.

I know hedge funds use sophisticated models to rebalance, have the right position sizes etc, I know I am limited (in terms of knowledge but also resources) to do this so I will keep it simple and try to position size based on the beta of the stock (past year) and volatility (measured last 200days). I will basically compare these to the overall market and position size accordingly. After that I basically multiply this value by 2x since this is a 2/1 portfolio.

Also correlations... this one is hard to get my head around since I want to be hedged when the market goes down so my mind would think I need to have low correlations but on the other hand why even hedge if you have low correlation since there would be no market risk then right? Anyway, I will try and keep correlations below .5 (so between my longs, but also my longs compared to short DAX etf)

My thought is that since I am not managing billions like hedge funds I somehow have better edge since I can get better prices.

Am I on the right track doing something like this or am I completely off? Just curious :)

Thanks a lot!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am wondering if any of you have long/short portfolios (similar to hedge funds) and have some success with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have decent knowledge on investing/trading in general but never paid attention to hedging out market risk when building a portfolio, but I am quite interested in creating something like this as a side portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thought is; i am going 200% long and 100% short (so double the long exposure compared to short) and instead of going short individual stocks, I am going short the market ETF (in my case DAX, Germany) and I will go long individual stocks (anywhere from 5 to 10). Since I have some experience in short term trading I am quite okay at predicting next 3 mnths out for small listed companies so I am planning to recycles these shares into new ones probably every earnings release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know hedge funds use sophisticated models to rebalance, have the right position sizes etc, I know I am limited (in terms of knowledge but also resources) to do this so I will keep it simple and try to position size based on the beta of the stock (past year) and volatility (measured last 200days). I will basically compare these to the overall market and position size accordingly. After that I basically multiply this value by 2x since this is a 2/1 portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also correlations... this one is hard to get my head around since I want to be hedged when the market goes down so my mind would think I need to have low correlations but on the other hand why even hedge if you have low correlation since there would be no market risk then right?

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2023-08-25.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

What do you use your regular brokerage account for? That account is more “liquid” so do you just buy something like VOO as a savings account for bigger purchases like a car?

So, I deposited the $6500 contribution limit at the beginning of the year. I then got married to my wife. And about a month ago I realized our combined income will be over the income limit. 

I recharacterized to a traditional IRA in schwab. They recharacterized about $6,9xx for whatever reason. I then did a backdoor roth and moved the $6,9xx back to the Roth IRA. 

I was just wondering if transferring the $6,9xx back to the Roth IRA is “going over” the $6,500 contribution for the year even though it was already in my account before?

195,investing,"Howdy!

I (33M/only child) come from humble upbringings. No one in my family has money. My dad and mother are both in separate nursing homes due to mental illness. They survive on SS/disability. I have no one to teach me. I'm alone in my new city.

I have recently come into a good job. I currently make xxx and in 5 years or so I will be making upwards of xxx. My 401k match from my company is great. This year I will hit the IRS limit for the first time in my life and I plan to continue to do so until I retire. I also invest $60 per paycheck into my ESPP (employee stock purchase program).

I bought a house last year financed for 350k at 3.375%. It's a fixer upper and will eventually need a full remodel. I'd like to eventually rent it out so that I can begin making passive income and allowing others to pay off my mortgage, but that could be years down the line due to costs associated with necessary remodeling, etc. After renting this property, I think it'd be nice to do the same on another property, rinse and repeat, but is real estate the way to go??

To summarize, I (1) invest 20% into my 401k, (2) invest slowly into my property equity with the hopes to rent, and (3) invest $3000 per year into my ESPP at a 10% discount.

I'd like to be work-optional in 20 years. As a staunch minimalist, I envision myself driving around the country in a van visiting National Parks, camping, and living off the passive income of a few rental properties as well as slowly withdrawing from a personal account until eligible to withdraw from my 401k at retirement age.

What should I learn about investing in the mean time? Should I start talking with a financial advisor at Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard about secondary investment strategies? I'm concerned about fees. Should I download Robinhood and start gambling? Should I take out a life insurance policy as an investment strategy like my uncle suggests? Everyone seems to say NO to life insurance in this way, but he swears by it.

I can feel that this moment in time will be pivotal to my future success and I want to go into this by being as educated and thorough as possible.

Yesterday morning I read that Boeing’s Q2 2023 free cash flow results were way way ahead of analyst expectations. Analysts estimated somewhere around $175 million - and Boeings actual FCF was reported at over $2 *billion*

I know that estimates are just that - estimates. But the difference between a billion and a million is a *lot* of money - not to mention 2 billion.

Does this mean that something increased the demand for one of their products in between Q1 and Q2? If so wouldn’t they be hyping that news ahead of time?

Does this mean that they just reduced expenses by 2 billion in between quarters? That seems like a lot of expenses.

214,investing,"Thanks to all for their help thus far, I learned a lot. I'm surer of my course now, but I still have some questions before I commit to any purchases (since these are large sums of money, I want to be certain)  
  
I have endeavored to read all the links posted thus far and the pertinent sections on the wiki, but it's possible I missed something, so here we go.  
  
a) It looks like Vanguard Lifestrategy is the go-to fund for investors outside the USA, since it is domiciled in Ireland and has all the fixings - good asset allocation, exposure and returns. I've seen it mentioned quite a few times in my search. I believe it also automatically rebalances?  
  
This looks like what I am looking for as a non-USA citizen, I cannot buy the funds usually mentioned. I'm thinking of using Interactive Brokers. (there is another broker with even cheaper brokerage fees, moomoo, but I'm not certain they offer this fund)  
  
b) After looking at target date retirement funds more, I'm not seeing how they outperform the above. Should I just go with Vanguard Lifestrategy?  
  
c) I am using YTD as my main valuation of a fund's performance (though of course I do look at the other areas, performance against benchmark, historical performance etc) Is this sound?  
  
d) I am assuming the reason why certain funds keep being recommended is because of their performance relative to locally performing funds...I took a look at some Singapore ETFs  
  
and I was not impressed by their performance. Even after accounting for the fact that dividends will be taxed, the global/Vanguard funds seem to come out ahead?  
  
e) I would also be looking to generate some dividends as a form of passive income while the bulk of my money is growing itself. AFAIK there is no way to take out a portion of the dividends as payout. So should I :

I&amp;#39;m surer of my course now, but I still have some questions before I commit to any purchases (since these are large sums of money, I want to be certain)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have endeavored to read all the links posted thus far and the pertinent sections on the wiki, but it&amp;#39;s possible I missed something, so here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) It looks like Vanguard Lifestrategy is the go-to fund for investors outside the USA, since it is domiciled in Ireland and has all the fixings - good asset allocation, exposure and returns. I&amp;#39;ve seen it mentioned quite a few times in my search. I believe it also automatically rebalances?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks like what I am looking for as a non-USA citizen, I cannot buy the funds usually mentioned. I&amp;#39;m thinking of using Interactive Brokers. (there is another broker with even cheaper brokerage fees, moomoo, but I&amp;#39;m not certain they offer this fund)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) After looking at target date retirement funds more, I&amp;#39;m not seeing how they outperform the above. Should I just go with Vanguard Lifestrategy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) I am using YTD as my main valuation of a fund&amp;#39;s performance (though of course I do look at the other areas, performance against benchmark, historical performance etc) Is this sound?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d) I am assuming the reason why certain funds keep being recommended is because of their performance relative to locally performing funds...I took a look at some Singapore ETFs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I was not impressed by their performance. Even after accounting for the fact that dividends will be taxed, the global/Vanguard funds seem to come out ahead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e) I would also be looking to generate some dividends as a form of passive income while the bulk of my money is growing itself. AFAIK there is no way to take out a portion of the dividends as payout. So should I :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- buy another fund for my passive income needs or&lt;/p&gt;

This whole thing strikes me as a bit bizarre tbh.

I work in a firm that helps people deal with bank closures so I see people getting their accounts closed extremely often. My firm has successfully argued on multiple occasions that these banks are actively discriminating against individuals (particularly of Iranian descent) and sought compensation, however, it's definitely an uphill battle and very little attention is given to these cases in the media.

The fact is, banks can technically close your account for any reason, and they don't have to give you a reason or any notice when closing your account. My clients don't have the same media backing as Nigel Farage, so they're often left waiting months or even years before any sort of resolution, and even the Financial Ombudsman usually rules in the bank's favour.

price = 97.335722

days_to_maturity = 182

and number of days in year is 366 because of a leap year.

the rate is indeed the one one quoted on the treasury website of 5.5%

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original problem:
So I just bought the 6 month T bill with serial 912797FC6 with my broker. The treasury website's coupon rate results table says the coupon rate is 5.504%. My broker displays like 5.47%. Meanwhile, both broker and treasury shows the price per $100 as being 97.335722. Now once I do 100 - 97.335722 = 2.664278 x 2 = 5.328556. So neither the 5.504% nor 5.47% nor 5.329% match here. What's happening? What's the true coupon rate?

edit: i actually found an explanation for this by another reddit here

https://www.reddit.com/r/bonds/comments/x3mhxw/high_rate_vs_investment_rate_for_treasury_direct/iz5qof2/

also a partial answer by someone in this comment second using the correct formula

97.335722(1+r/2) = 100

r = 2(100/97.335722-1) = 0.054744 or 5.4744%

edit2: it seems a few people have told me that my broker gave me a worse price. this is not true. according to the treasury website's bond price, i am also getting the same with my broker.

249,investing,"Greetings!  


I wanna invest into AI and cant decide whats the best call there. I think most will agree that the best bet for AI is to invest into the Big Companys: Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Meta, Google and Amazon. (Tesla not included because i dont like Elon tbh).  


Investing into S&amp;P Tech will give me big Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA but not the other companys. Investing into NASDAQ 100 will give me all of them, but with a lower Rate (can be good can be bad). And of course i just can buy those 6 Stocks.  


I think Apple (even if they dont have LLMs yet) will be big in AI in 1-2 Years and the capability shipping local AI on all of their devices are insane.  Huge potential here + we talk about Apple. Microsoft is playing the AI game better than anyone else right now and coming GPT Versions will slap. I also like the new approach of Meta and with LLAMA there is also huge Potential. NVIDIA is of course also a no brainer (even if some ppl think they are overvalued), they are way ahead of other companys like AMD right now. Amazon while not having insane LLMs right now, has of course on of the best Sectors to apply AI in general.

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanna invest into AI and cant decide whats the best call there. I think most will agree that the best bet for AI is to invest into the Big Companys: Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Meta, Google and Amazon. (Tesla not included because i dont like Elon tbh).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing into S&amp;amp;P Tech will give me big Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA but not the other companys. Investing into NASDAQ 100 will give me all of them, but with a lower Rate (can be good can be bad). And of course i just can buy those 6 Stocks.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Apple (even if they dont have LLMs yet) will be big in AI in 1-2 Years and the capability shipping local AI on all of their devices are insane.  Huge potential here + we talk about Apple. Microsoft is playing the AI game better than anyone else right now and coming GPT Versions will slap. I also like the new approach of Meta and with LLAMA there is also huge Potential. NVIDIA is of course also a no brainer (even if some ppl think they are overvalued), they are way ahead of other companys like AMD right now. Amazon while not having insane LLMs right now, has of course on of the best Sectors to apply AI in general.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With alphabet i have to say, im not so sure. Their new Model is strong, but i kinda didn&amp;#39;t feel good about the company as a whole. Hard to explain why.   &lt;/p&gt;

I know I'd rather have $10,000 or so more in retirement than having less and having my portfolio look more pretty with a bunch of ETFs that are underperformers, but make me feel clever. If you enjoy having less money then just stop reading here. If you have a ""pretty"" portfolio, but want to make more, than read on.

I have read advice about people investing in things like VTI, when it is inferior to the likes of VOO. I understand that VTI is conceptually more attractive since it includes all the stocks in the US rather than the top 500. The bottom line is that underperforms VOO and will continue to do so, it is as simple as that.

I have even read people say to get VT, because now you own the world. Dude, just get VOO, because you're going to make more money. ""Well you never know, the US could go to hell yada yada"", yeah I guess it could, but let's be real. VT performed 31.9% in the past 5 years, VOO performed 61.39% in the past 5 years. You really want to give up those returns based on your own hunch that a black swan could happen?! ""Past results don't predict future results"", maybe so, but be reasonable. The US has the highest GDP in the world by a good margin. Even if the US falls below number 1 in GDP, it will still be better owning companies there than owning some rando company in Africa.

There is another strategy of investing in VXUS and VTI together while rebalancing every year. Maybe this makes you feel smart, but you are making this more complicated than it needs to be and just lowering your return. Just buy VOO.

VOO is also better than SPY because the expense ratio is 0.03% instead of 0.09%. The difference is not terribly significant, but over time it isn't trivial.

Stop trying to make your portfolio pretty with all these different ETFs to make you feel more diversified. VOO is diversified enough and it is a powerhouse at creating wealth.

Here's some ways I've identified, I'm sure there's more but I want to know why some are better than others and what you all do.

Starting example;

Month 1:

\- (Month 1 they were all 100$ and 25% allocation)

Beginning of month 2:

\- B rose,        $120 balance and 24% of portfolio

\- C (flat)         $100 balance and 20% of portfolio

\- D fell,          $ 80 balance and 16% of portfolio

**Static Equal-Weight**

Would add $100 monthly to each, no matter what.

**Catch-Up / Help out the ""Losers""**

Currently valued at $500, and would be adding $400, so 1/4 of the total is $225. They would add $25 to A, $105 to B, $125 to C, and $145 to D.

**ETF-Style / Pile onto ""Winners""**

Would now add 40% of their contribution to A, 24% to B, etc.

**Magnified ETF-Style**

Greatly increases exposure to winners and decreases exposure to losers. Starts with a constant magnification rate &gt;1 (let's say 2).

\- A's share rose 15%, so multiply by the rate to get 30%

\- C's share fell 5%, multiplied would be -10%

Would allocate like this:

\- A: 55% \[25 + 2 \* (40 - 25)\]

\- B: 23%

\- C: 15%

\- D: 7%  \[25 + 2 \* (16 - 25)\]

**Dynamic Equal-Weight** (Less applicable in this example)

Would buy and \*sell\* in order to keep all at 25%

## Bear Market Data

* The Dot.Com Bubble saw a total loss of -73.44%
* 2008 saw a total loss of -36.3%
* 2022 saw a total loss of -32.97%

## Risk Data

I recently started a job where I have access to two 401a accounts, a 403b, and a 457b, all through my employer. I am currently maxing out my 401a accounts and my 403b. I am also doing a BD Roth and maxing that out for my wife and I. I have my own individual brokerage account as well. 

My financial advisor is not advising against it, but he is wary about the 457b (reasons such as the idea of deferred salary, solvency concerns, ability to transfer if I change jobs, etc…). Even with these other accounts maxed out in contributions, I still have some money left over I want to invest long term for retirement (from the 20% of my total salary).  One of the options he suggested was looking into a Variable Universal Life policy and using it as a means to invest long term. The policy has access to investing in large cap index funds with relatively low maintenance costs. I have researched VULs and am aware of how they can be utilized for long term investing, borrowing against the policy when withdrawing to avoid taxes at the cost of some interest, the fees associated with VULs, etc…

What are your thoughts on VULs? Should I just take the rest of my savings allocation and dump it into my individual brokerage account and index funds and pay the capital gains taxes instead?

Before anyone gets on me about my financial advisor and the advice I’m getting, I’ve been with him for 5 years, everything we’ve talked about are always open discussions and never posited like a snake oil salesman throwing me a pitch.

But why is the interest rate shown as 3.38%? 

I know I mistakenly deposited and bought another 10k of I-bond while the supposed limit is 10k/year. Otherwise I think I'll have to pay the tax/penalty on the interest earn on that extra 10k. I emailed them to have it transferred out but Treasury Direct *never* responded to my email. So, my question is, if I wait until 06/2024 to redeem, am I ok since we can consider the extra 10k bought on 05/2022 as another 10k bought in 2023?

Otherwise I think I&amp;#39;ll have to pay the tax/penalty on the interest earn on that extra 10k. I emailed them to have it transferred out but Treasury Direct &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; responded to my email. So, my question is, if I wait until 06/2024 to redeem, am I ok since we can consider the extra 10k bought on 05/2022 as another 10k bought in 2023?&lt;/p&gt;

Hello Investing,

32M, I have no kids of my own and not sure that I ever want to, but have the two sweetest nieces in the world who are both under 8 years old. I have had some great career opportunities over the past few years and find myself with a significant amount of disposable income at the end of each month. I’m already maxing out 401k, ESPP, and have a very comfortable emergency fund as well as a cash reserve for a down payment on a house if this market ever cools down. 

I’m interested in setting some money aside each month in an account specifically for each of them for when they’re ready for college/trade school/whatever productive thing they decide to do when they’re adults. My sister is a teacher and her husband is owns a small business and they do fine financially, but I would love to give the girls opportunities and possibly take some financial burden off of my sister and her husband. 

I would love some guidance or advice on avenues to achieve this, I’m thinking $500-$1000 each to start an account and then chipping in $50-$100 per month so long as I’m still in a position to do so. 

Are there any considerations or watch-outs for this since I am not their legal guardian, and is there anything i should consider as ways to protect them from themselves? (I was 18 once and can’t imagine what I’d have done if a lump of cash fell in my lap)

Thank you in advance!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Investing,&lt;/p&gt;

If you find this helpful: I publish info about central bank events and speakers weekly, check out my profile.

**Here are the comments sorted by most recent first:**

* **Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-7-14 T-7:** There is a path to curb inflation without recession.
* **Daly  (Neutral)  2023-7-13 T-8:** Going to continue to work on rate hikes until we are sure that inflation is on the path to come back down toward 2%, the good news on inflation this week is indeed good news but too early to say we can declare victory, saying that we needed two hikes was a way to keep optionality open, cumulative effects of monetary tightening still to work their way through the system, thought that the banking crisis could be worth 1 to 2 tightenings but not seeing that impact, as inflation starts coming down we can start lowering the nominal rate to bring real rates down to neutral levels, wants to start heading towards the neutral rate as we approach 2% on inflation.
* **Waller  (Hawk)  2023-7-13 T-8:** September is a live meeting for monetary policy, in favour of raising rates at the July meeting, likely to need two more 25 basis point rate hikes this year, the bulk of past rate hikes already have impacted economy, economic strength gives the Fed space to hike further, fighting inflation remains main goal, cooler CPI data is welcome but need to see if it is sustained, inflation has shown false dawns before, the jobs market has slowed but remains strong, a soft landing for the economy is still possible.
* **Barkin  (Neutral)  2023-7-12 T-9:** Inflation is still too high, still a question whether inflation can settle while labour market remains as strong as it is, comfortable doing more with policy if incoming data does not confirm inflation will return to target.
* **Kashkari  (Hawk)  2023-7-12 T-9:** May need to raise rates further if high inflation persists, the fight against inflation must succeed, bank supervisors should ensure all banks are prepared to withstand higher rate environment.
* **Barr  (Neutral)  2023-7-10 T-11:** Inflation is far too high, we are quite attentive to bringing it down to target, we have made a lot of progress on inflation, still have a bit of work to do, the need for regulators to focus on bank resilience broadly has been reinforced by recent bank failures.
* **Bostic  (Neutral)  2023-7-10 T-11:** There's no expectation of needing to raise rates further, this is a hard judgment call, the path forward is no longer obvious, even with a 25 bps move at the next meeting it will still require patience, it's a ""pretty straightforward story"" that inflation could return to 2% without rates rising further, a lot of the strength in the economy is due to pandemic support, inflation is too high and not sustainable, there are no expectations for a daramatic sea change in inflation, the biggest risk is not moving inflation back to target and all of the Fed is in consensus on that view, the trajectory on inflation right now is ""in the right direction"", policy is clearly in restrictive territory and the Fed can be patient, would not be comfortable if inflation stalls or expectations rise, right now expectations are pretty well anchored.
* **Daly  (Neutral)  2023-7-10 T-11:** There is more we need to do to raise rates, risks have become more balanced, sees the need for two more rate hikes this year to bring inflation back to 2% goal, the precise number of hikes may be adjusted based on economic data, the risk of underacting continues to outweigh the risk of overacting but these risks are becoming more balanced.
* **Mester  (Hawk)  2023-7-10 T-11:** The Fed will need to tighten somewhat further to lower inflation, no decision yet on the need for a July hike, the outlook for the terminal rate matches or is just above June's median forecast, there was a preference for a June hike but there's an understanding as to why there wasn't any action taken, closer to the end of the tightening campaign than to the start, policy is less restrictive compared to history, raising rates again will reduce the risk of more action in the future, the economy has proven stronger than expected, core inflation remains too high and broad-based, wage pressures remain too high to get inflation back to 2%, business leaders' fears of a recession have declined, too early to say the neutral rate has shifted much.
* **Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-7-7 T-14:** Sees 1-2 more rate hikes this year, I haven't seen anything that says one or two more hikes this year is wrong, still undecided on July hike, I feel like we're on the golden path to ""no recession and the inflation target"", the job market is outstanding, there's a lag to monetary policy, inflation is down somewhat but needs to come down more,  
* **Logan  (Neutral)  2023-7-6 T-15:** More rate hikes are likely necessary, would have been okay with a June hike, challenging and uncertain environment enabled June pause, very concerned whether inflation will cool quickly enough, skeptical about the lagged impact of past rate hikes, the housing market may have bottomed out, the Fed has room to shrink the balance sheet for quite some time.
* **Williams  (Neutral)  2023-7-5 T-16:** Slowing down rate rises makes sense right now, future rate rises are still in play, fully supported the Fed's decision to hold rates steady at the June FOMC, not content with where inflation is right now, open question how fast inflation will cool next year, fighting inflation remains the Fed's main job, the economy has handled rate hikes ""reasonably well"", surprised to see the resilience of the housing market, the economy still has a strong demand for labour.
* **Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-6-30 T-21:** There is nothing in the Fed's mandate about stock prices, I hope the market remains sober, have to see through the market's ups and downs, have not made up my mind on rates, there is a number of data releases before the next Fed meeting, there is a lag in the impact of interest rates on the economy, hopeful we can get inflation down to target without a recession, the strongest part of the economic data is the labour market.
* **Bostic  (Neutral)  2023-6-29 T-22:** I don't see as much urgency to move as stated by others, nobody should take a signal from my view that we should pause, we're not seeing inflation moving away from target, comfortable waiting, there are undoubtedly scenarios where we could move at two meetings in a row but not expecting that will happen, will do more if needed, less concerned about high inflation.
* **Bostic 2023-6-29 T-22:** Not ready to rule out further rate hikes if required but does not see need, does not see Fed rate cuts in 2023 or 2024, monetary policy has only recently moved into restrictive territory, effects of monetary policy tightening are starting to show up in the real economy, policy in place to bring inflation back to 2% target, it's unambiguous that inflation has fallen considerably, inflation is in a gradual cooling trend that should continue, inflation should cool even if Fed leaves current policy in place, expects to reach inflation goal without causing severe downturn.
* **Powell  (Neutral)  2023-6-29 T-22:** The process of getting to 2% inflation target has a long way to go, expects moderate pace of interest rate decisions to continue, a strong majority of the FOMC expects it to be appropriate to hike rates two or more times by the end of the year, inflation is well above the goal, the xtent of effects from tighter credit conditions remains uncertain, will take time for the rest of the economy to feel the full impact of rate hikes so far, the labour market is very tight.
* **Powell  (Neutral)  2023-6-28 T-23:** We believe there is more restrictive policy coming, policy hasn't been restrictive for very long, have not made a decision to hike at every other meeting, would not take moving at consecutive meetings off the table, data over the last quarter has been strong, as we get closer and close to the goal the risks become more balanced, haven't seen much progress in non-housing services, high labour costs in non-housing services are causing inflationary pressures, need to see more softening in the labour market.
* **Williams  (Neutral)  2023-6-26 T-25:** Restoring price stability is of ""paramount importance"".
* **Bostic  (Neutral)  2023-6-23 T-28:** Expects jobless rate to rise from historically low level, not seeing elements of risk appearing in the economy, credit risk is likely coming and real estate could pose a risk, the banking sector is quite strong.
* **Daly  (Neutral)  2023-6-23 T-28:** Two more rate hikes this year is a ""very reasonable"" projection, it's only a projection and we don't know for sure, prudent to slow the pace of hikes as we approach destination, risks over overtightening and undertightening are about balanced, strongly supported June decision to hold rates and watch the data, credit tightening so far is consistent with what would have been expected without March banking turmoil.
* **Barkin  (Neutral)  2023-6-22 T-29:** Will not prejudge the July meeting, would be content with more hikes if inflation is not progressing towards the goad, would support rate cuts when there is conviction that inflation is heading down, still a good way from the 2% inflation target, demand is still elevated compared with its pre-pandemic trend and boosting inflation but it does seem it's weakening.
* **Bowman  (Neutral)  2023-6-22 T-29:** Additional rate hikes will be needed to reach sufficiently restrictive level, inflation still ""unacceptably high"" despite drop in headline number, core inflation has essentially plateaued since the fall of 2022, will look for inflation on a consistent downward path in deciding appropriate policy steps at coming meetings.
* **Powell  (Neutral)  2023-6-22 T-29:** A strong majority feels there is a little further to go on rate hikes, decision last week was to move more slowly, we kept rates on hold to give ourselves more time to make a decision, headline inflation has come down but that's largely from energy and food and not principally a function of monetary policy, we still have a long way to go, we have not seen much progress in the way of services inflation, we expect inflation to move down this year, I see a path for inflation to continue falling with little increase in unemployment.
* **Bostic  (Neutral)  2023-6-21 T-30:** Rates should stay where they are for the rest of the year, does not see rate cuts for most of 2024, further rate hikes may needlessly drain the economy, wants to give the economy more time to adjust to rate hikes before doing more, policy has not been restrictive for long enough for its effects to be felt so it's prudent to wait, maintaining the current rate will be passive tightening of the real rate that will still aid in fighting inflation, risk of inflation rebounding is ""not my baseline"", some further slowing of the labour market may be necessary, contagion that was feared from earlier bank failures has not materialized.
* **Cook  (Neutral)  2023-6-21 T-30:** We are not there yet on getting inflation back to target, there isn't much here to indicate any unease about hiking in July.
* **Jefferson  (Neutral)  2023-6-21 T-30:** Recent bank troubles present downside economic risk, watching commercial real estate for risks.
* **Powell  (Neutral)  2023-6-21 T-30:** Nearly all FOMC participants expect it will be appropriate to raise rates somewhat further by year end, the two hikes pencilled into the dot plot is a pretty good guess of what will happen, a big majority believes in raising rates twice this year, the level for rates and speed of hikes are separate, it may make sense to move rates higher at more moderate pace, the Fed is now moderating the pace of rate hikes, will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, we never use the word pause and wouldn't use that here today, the process of getting inflation back to 2% ""has a long way to go"", will take time to see full effects of policy tightening, tighter credit likely to weight on economic activity but extent remains uncertain, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, factors contributing to inflation decline are happening but later than expected, it is important that the balance sheet doesn't just grow with every cycle, balance sheet should be smaller than now but need a buffer against scarce reserves, don't want to be in the same position as last reduction cycle, there is a gradual cooling in the labour market but we're not there yet, still significant labour shortages, the US dollar is still the dominant reserve currency.
* **Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-6-21 T-30:** Decision last week was a close call for me, have not decided yet on July, the Feds framework is ""wait and see"", perfectly appropriate to have a reconnaissance mission now, trying to figure out if we have done enough and how much more needs to be done, probably won't gain enough info in 6 weeks but will learn more, over the next couple months will get a sense if goods inflation is coming down, the lags argument is a tremendously important one.
* **Kugler  (n/a)  2023-6-21 T-30:** Both sides of the Fed's mandate are important, pushing inflation down is the Fed's main mission now.
* **Cook  (Neutral)  2023-6-20 T-31:** Focused on inflation until the job is done.
* **Jefferson  (Neutral)  2023-6-20 T-31:** I remain focused on returning inflation to 2%, inflation has started to abate, must remain attentive to inflation and banking-sector stress, US banking system is sound and resilient, I remain attuned to any threats to banking system stability.
* **Kugler  (n/a)  2023-6-20 T-31:** Deeply committed to setting monetary policy to reduce inflation and promote maximum employment, important to bring inflation down to 2% target.
* **Barkin  (Neutral)  2023-6-16 T-35:** Comfortable doing more on interest rates if the coming data doesn't confirm that slowing demand is returning inflation to the 2% target, higher rates may create the risk of a more significant slowdown, experience of the 1970s shows that the Fed should not back off its inflation fight too soon, inflation has proven stubbornly persistent, still looking to be convinced that weakening demand will control it.
* **Waller  (Hawk)  2023-6-16 T-35:** The US economy is still ripping along, it's disturbing that core inflation is not improving, will probably require more tightening, so far it looks as if the idea of labour market softening without much rise in unemployment is holding up, it's still not clear that recent bank failures have had a material effect on credit conditions.
* **Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-6-16 T-35:** Pausing for now to scope out economic developments, there are conflicting pieces of evidence coming from the economy: is it too hot and we need to do more or have we done enough on rates over the last year?, we're just going to have to play it by ear I guess.
* **Powell  (Neutral)  2023-6-14 T-37:** The full effects of our policy have yet to be felt, nearly all policymakers view some further rate hikes this year as appropriate, inflation has moderated somewhat but still has a long way to go, if the economy evolves as expected the median of participants sees 5.6% FFR at year-end, Fed projections are not a plan or a decision, will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, have not made a decision about July, I expect July to be a live meeting, it's common sense to go a bit slower on rate hikes as we near the destination, inflation risks are still to the upside, not seeing a lot of progress on core PCE, rate cuts are not appropriate this year and no policymaker saw rate cuts this year, economic data came in consistent with but on the high side of expectations, the conditions we need to see in place to get inflation down are coming into place including lower growth labour slack, we don't know the full extent of the banking turmoil.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have three G8 central bank meetings next week: the Fed, the ECB and the BOJ.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powell  (Neutral)  2023-6-21 T-30:&lt;/strong&gt; Nearly all FOMC participants expect it will be appropriate to raise rates somewhat further by year end, the two hikes pencilled into the dot plot is a pretty good guess of what will happen, a big majority believes in raising rates twice this year, the level for rates and speed of hikes are separate, it may make sense to move rates higher at more moderate pace, the Fed is now moderating the pace of rate hikes, will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, we never use the word pause and wouldn&amp;#39;t use that here today, the process of getting inflation back to 2% &amp;quot;has a long way to go&amp;quot;, will take time to see full effects of policy tightening, tighter credit likely to weight on economic activity but extent remains uncertain, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, factors contributing to inflation decline are happening but later than expected, it is important that the balance sheet doesn&amp;#39;t just grow with every cycle, balance sheet should be smaller than now but need a buffer against scarce reserves, don&amp;#39;t want to be in the same position as last reduction cycle, there is a gradual cooling in the labour market but we&amp;#39;re not there yet, still significant labour shortages, the US dollar is still the dominant reserve currency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-6-21 T-30:&lt;/strong&gt; Decision last week was a close call for me, have not decided yet on July, the Feds framework is &amp;quot;wait and see&amp;quot;, perfectly appropriate to have a reconnaissance mission now, trying to figure out if we have done enough and how much more needs to be done, probably won&amp;#39;t gain enough info in 6 weeks but will learn more, over the next couple months will get a sense if goods inflation is coming down, the lags argument is a tremendously important one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kugler  (n/a)  2023-6-21 T-30:&lt;/strong&gt; Both sides of the Fed&amp;#39;s mandate are important, pushing inflation down is the Fed&amp;#39;s main mission now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook  (Neutral)  2023-6-20 T-31:&lt;/strong&gt; Focused on inflation until the job is done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jefferson  (Neutral)  2023-6-20 T-31:&lt;/strong&gt; I remain focused on returning inflation to 2%, inflation has started to abate, must remain attentive to inflation and banking-sector stress, US banking system is sound and resilient, I remain attuned to any threats to banking system stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kugler  (n/a)  2023-6-20 T-31:&lt;/strong&gt; Deeply committed to setting monetary policy to reduce inflation and promote maximum employment, important to bring inflation down to 2% target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barkin  (Neutral)  2023-6-16 T-35:&lt;/strong&gt; Comfortable doing more on interest rates if the coming data doesn&amp;#39;t confirm that slowing demand is returning inflation to the 2% target, higher rates may create the risk of a more significant slowdown, experience of the 1970s shows that the Fed should not back off its inflation fight too soon, inflation has proven stubbornly persistent, still looking to be convinced that weakening demand will control it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waller  (Hawk)  2023-6-16 T-35:&lt;/strong&gt; The US economy is still ripping along, it&amp;#39;s disturbing that core inflation is not improving, will probably require more tightening, so far it looks as if the idea of labour market softening without much rise in unemployment is holding up, it&amp;#39;s still not clear that recent bank failures have had a material effect on credit conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goolsbee  (Dove)  2023-6-16 T-35:&lt;/strong&gt; Pausing for now to scope out economic developments, there are conflicting pieces of evidence coming from the economy: is it too hot and we need to do more or have we done enough on rates over the last year?, we&amp;#39;re just going to have to play it by ear I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powell  (Neutral)  2023-6-14 T-37:&lt;/strong&gt; The full effects of our policy have yet to be felt, nearly all policymakers view some further rate hikes this year as appropriate, inflation has moderated somewhat but still has a long way to go, if the economy evolves as expected the median of participants sees 5.6% FFR at year-end, Fed projections are not a plan or a decision, will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, have not made a decision about July, I expect July to be a live meeting, it&amp;#39;s common sense to go a bit slower on rate hikes as we near the destination, inflation risks are still to the upside, not seeing a lot of progress on core PCE, rate cuts are not appropriate this year and no policymaker saw rate cuts this year, economic data came in consistent with but on the high side of expectations, the conditions we need to see in place to get inflation down are coming into place including lower growth labour slack, we don&amp;#39;t know the full extent of the banking turmoil.&lt;/li&gt;

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2023-09-01.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Upcoming Earnings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priced Move:&lt;/strong&gt; given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call/Put Premium:&lt;/strong&gt; How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are &amp;quot;cheaper.&amp;quot; High numbers mean options are &amp;quot;expensive.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I came across this blog post that delves into the world of options trading in the UK. As someone interested in investments, I found it incredibly informative and thought it might be helpful for others too.

The blog covers the legal landscape and regulations overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for options trading in the UK. It explains the role of derivatives, key regulatory bodies, and the requirements for options traders to operate legally and ethically. Additionally, it discusses tax considerations, risks, and protections for traders, making it a must-read for anyone starting or exploring options trading.

I found the tips for navigating the legal landscape particularly useful, along with common legal issues and challenges traders may face. It's evident that the blog aims to educate readers.

Eurozone core inflation accelerated .4% last month which is twice as much as the number in May.

Core consumer prices, stripping out volatile elements like food and energy, rose 5.5% from a year earlier, Eurostat said Wednesday. That was above the estimate of 5.4% and a reading of 5.3% in May.

Headline inflation came also out at 5.5% YoY with 0.3% added last month which was more than May.

ECB chief Lagarde already made clear more rate hikes will come to combat higher consumer prices.

Even if you think crypto is one big scam predicated on the greater fool theory, you have to admit that the returns seen over the last 10 years are nothing short of astronomical. So even if it's just as 'fun money', as a gambling play, or a 'just in case..', do you hold any crypto?

As the title says, I am unclear on how i”ll see returns from investing in gold especially jewelry. Traditionally in asian cultures gold was considered well the gold standard for liquid cash esp in case of emergency. One could even get loans against it from banks etc. I can see value of holding pure gold bars (10 g or an ounce) But feels like it would serve me better if I stick that money in HYSA or in my brokerage account.

I'm reaching out to you all for some guidance on analyzing oil &amp; gas limited partnerships. While I consider myself well-versed in accounting and financial analysis, my expertise mainly lies with public companies and small businesses. Limited partnerships (LPs) in the oil &amp; gas industry are new territory for me, and I could use some assistance in understanding their peculiarities.

The company I'm looking into is a prominent exploration &amp; operating firm with a focus on the Permian and Anadarko basins, along with its affiliates. I want to make informed decisions, but I'm not familiar with the customary margins, key metrics, and industry-specific risks that come with oil &amp; gas limited partnerships.

If any of you have experience in this area or can offer valuable insights, I'd greatly appreciate your input. Here are a few specific questions I have:

1. Margins &amp; Key Metrics: What are the typical margins for oil &amp; gas limited partnerships, and which key metrics should I pay close attention to while evaluating their financial health?
2. Industry-specific Risks: Could you shed some light on the common risks associated with the oil &amp; gas sector and how they specifically impact limited partnerships?
3. Regulatory Considerations: Are there any unique regulatory aspects I should be aware of when dealing with LPs in the oil &amp; gas industry? The company in question almost exclusively develops and operates horizontal wells (which, if I understand it correctly, uses hydraulic fracking).

399,investing,"Hello, I have been reading through a book called Rich Dad poor dad, and the author at the end of the book talks about some things that they have done as examples of how it may not be difficult to invest and to secure a good portfolio.

One of the things that he mentioned is that he starts to look at CDs with 20% interest rate or more and that currently he was looking at a CD with 25% interest rate. I wish there was more to it but that's literally all he said about it.

My question is: what in the world is he talking about?

Is he actually talking about a credit default swap?

It's just that it looks like all Bank CDs are in the range of 4-6% interest generally.

Does anyone know what he is talking about with that high of an interest rate, or if he is taking advantage of some special program, like unsecured cds, or maybe if it has to do with him being in a different country, I suspect that he might be in India instead of the US where I am.

Hope this is the right place to ask this! I’m looking to transfer my $3.6k brokerage account funds with Ellevest (aka Goldman Sachs Custody Solutions) to a Fidelity brokerage account. I’ve had the Ellevest account since April 2022.

2. Interest rate stay the same - ETF will still make slow up moves because of the coupon it receive from underlying

3. Interest rate increases - Let's say they increase from 3% to 5%. The ETF will go down. It's a scenario where I lose but interest rates are most likely to down in 5 year period. So chance of this are very low.

&lt;p&gt;401(k) contributions are currently 12%, company matching 8%. Soon I’m thinking I’ll drop it down to 6% (I still get 8% matched). Roth IRA is $500 monthly plus once more to max contributions. Taxable is $200 monthly. I also have ~$10k in TBills and a bit of Disney stock gifted to me when I was young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRA is growth tilted since that’ll be cooking for a while and I’m willing to take on a bit of extra risk in the short run. While I went a little safer in the Taxable. As I get older I’ll start investing in bonds. And as I learn more about investing I’m sure I’ll start to spread out to emerging markets and REITs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a relatively basic spread but I’m just worried that the funds I’ve picked are spreading my current money too thin without actually adding any benefits to my portfolio. Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

In general, wouldn't it be better to buy a CD ladder using money that is already locked up (e.g. a tax-protected IRA) than using liquid money (e.g. online savings account). Reason being, the IRA money is already locked up. The Savings account is liquid, and you are now locking it up in CDs.

E.G. (to keep it simple) Suppose in my IRA I have 100k in VOO. And then I also have 100k in Savings. And I want to create a CD ladder with 100k to lock in some high rates for a few years. I can either convert the Savings to a CD ladder, in which case I can't touch ANY cash at all, OR... I can convert the VOO to a CD ladder, and then move the 100K of Savings into a new VOO investment.

Basically I have a Schwab account that my mom setup for me while very young and looked after until I was 21ish. I have a Roth IRA which I contribute to monthly and consider my long-term/retirement savings, and I have a brokerage account that I also contribute to monthly which I consider relatively short term savings.

About a year ago, I made the huge shift to put most of my cash in SWAGX, whereas it was in SWVXX prior. My reasoning was that I understood the money market as being no risk, very low reward (small interest growth), whereas the bond funds were also very low risk but would grow my money slightly more than the money market, while still being accessible.

Fast forward to today, I'm down over 15% in the bond fund and therefore feel like most of my short terms savings are locked up. I definitely have \~3 months of rent and car payments in cash in case something terrible happens with work or whatever, but I am considering some potential big and/or expensive life changes in the near future and feel like I'm stuck because I've lost so much money.

A few months ago, I started working at my  father’s import/export company that mainly deals with statues, fountains, and lamps. 

Outside of our regular container orders/contracts to clients, my father has been holding about $1.5 million worth of retail ready statues, fountains, and lamps.. approximately 15 truckloads each composed of 24 pallets. 

The first three truckloads were a mess, being a mixture of older mixed count pallets, lamp/statue loose parts, and extremely old items (like from the 90s lol). Luckily, I exited three pallets and found a consistent buyer that will move the remainder of our products in the warehouse at about 20% of retail value. I was able to exit the majority of our company’s mixed items/parts at $25-$50 a pallet, and I got lowballed and fell for a $3,000 cash offer for a truckload (I priced at $5,500) worth about $100,000 because at the time I had no clients and my customers felt my desperation. Today, I just exited 2 Case-back trailers at 20% of retail each which is my goal and I’m getting ready to exit another 2 trailers every week/2weeks. So total, sold 5 truck loads have about 10 more. Current customers that I enjoy working with and pay my asking price only ask that they exclusively move the remainder of my family’s warehouse goods, to which I agreed to.

Now as business is picking up, I’m trying to plan for the future because I will be taking a brief break from work in person (can still work remote) due to university starting up at the end of next month. 

For context, i am currently at a halfway house ankle monitor program and am scheduled to be released in exactly a year. Program constraints are I’m not allowed to work and go to school, I can only do one at a time and my parents are pushing me to graduate engineering school. So one year from today, I should be a free man and a industrial engineering graduate. 

That being said, I’m on track to clear out our warehouse in the next few months but I feel like I could be doing more. My father has an idea for a new line of statues that I think will sell well, so I might do a trade show or two and fly out to China to negotiate licensing and royalties when I’m out of my program and parole. We also have an Amazon store that was selling about $6,000 a week but my dad shut down when we moved warehouses. 

This is where the business is at so far and I would like some feedback on how to scale or branch out the businesses remotely now and physically about a year from now. Also, idk if it helps but we control the design patents and distribution/allocation out of China as well. 

Outside of the company 

Personally, I plan to build an adu in my parents’ backyard so I’ll have discounted rent (most likely $500/month), and we have extra cars so I won’t need to pay for more than gas. I haven’t held a legitimate job till now for many years so I’ll qualify for an FHA loan, and I was thinking of buying a tri-plex in my area with 3% down on $750k. I also have two buddies willing to match my down payment in cash to become equal owners of my property. They also agreed to let me pocket the rent for 2/3 units the first year (cannot rent out all three units the first year cuz fha)and after the first year we split maintenance , mortgage, bills, and incoming rent three ways.  The property is near my college and I intend to look for tenants and a tenant network in the next year.

I have moderate knowledge on stocks, bonds, options, and crypto and have my hand a little bit in each already. 

How do I scale my life up and maximize the blessings my family provided? I been on my own since 17 and at 25 coming out of prison I’m overwhelmed with gratefulness to have a good family that supports me and I’m grateful for my transitional program for letting me hit the streets running by the time I’m out.

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I plan to build an adu in my parents’ backyard so I’ll have discounted rent (most likely $500/month), and we have extra cars so I won’t need to pay for more than gas. I haven’t held a legitimate job till now for many years so I’ll qualify for an FHA loan, and I was thinking of buying a tri-plex in my area with 3% down on $750k. I also have two buddies willing to match my down payment in cash to become equal owners of my property. They also agreed to let me pocket the rent for 2/3 units the first year (cannot rent out all three units the first year cuz fha)and after the first year we split maintenance , mortgage, bills, and incoming rent three ways.  The property is near my college and I intend to look for tenants and a tenant network in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have moderate knowledge on stocks, bonds, options, and crypto and have my hand a little bit in each already. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I scale my life up and maximize the blessings my family provided? I been on my own since 17 and at 25 coming out of prison I’m overwhelmed with gratefulness to have a good family that supports me and I’m grateful for my transitional program for letting me hit the streets running by the time I’m out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to squander these blessings, what would you guys do if you were in my shoes? How would you manage the family business?&lt;/p&gt;

451,investing,"A lot of commentators, economists, etc... have been referring to a ""lag"" that occurs after the Fed changes interest rates. The lag is the time the changes in rates will actually appear in the economic activity of the citizenry. The time frame is often quoted as being somewhere around 18 months. 

I have searched various articles about this, and some people agree with it, and some don't. What I don't seem to see is if there is a difference in the lag duration when rates are going up vs when rates are going down. For example, over the past few decades rates have been steadily declining, and every time rates fell far enough I would immediately refinance my mortgage. This would result in lower monthly expenses, more purchasing power, and more economic activity on my part. It was like having an economic stimulus check every time rates would fall another hundred or so basis points. So the ""lag"" seems like it would be pretty short as rates drop. 

As interest rates go up however, myself and millions like me are sitting tight. And the only change in my economic activity from a monetary policy standpoint has been slightly higher monthly dividends from my money market account, which I will spend into the economy. So again, its like a mini stimulus even as rates increase. So the ""lag"" in this scenario (lower economic activity) seems like it could take years and years, until people either die off, are forced to move for work, etc....

I realize that mortgages are not the only source of debt out there, but something like 80% of Americans who own homes have a mortgage under ~~3%~~ 4%, and around 65% of all American's own their home so there is a massive pool of people who have seen no major change to their monthly expenses, and if they happen to have any money in fixed income they might even have more income coming in, spending more, so hiking interest rates has had no impact for them even after 18 months.

I’m reading “The Simple Path to Wealth” by JL Collins and am hung up on the idea of a traditional IRA. I am already maxing out my 401k and I make above the income limit for any deduction that would be available for a deductible IRA. What is the point then in having an IRA instead of just investing the money in stocks? In my mind I get more liquidity in just directly investing in the stock market so not sure what I’m missing?

464,investing,"Hello,

I am not trying to go down the rabbit hole of how exactly the 2008 crisis took shape.  I am also not saying the market will/should crash. I am also not asking IF the market will crash. My question is towards the bottom of the post, and more oriented towards understanding our current market.


From what I understand, the insurers that underwrote policies insuring the CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations - essentially ""collections of mortgage loans"") didn't act ""morally"" and insured collections of bad loans. A large reason for this was Credit Rating agencies issuing inaccurate good ratings for the CDOs and other housing loan related securities. This in turn led to a false confidence from the banks issuing loans,  incentivized them to give out loans regardless of the buyers' ability to pay it back (since the risk was taken by the insurers who were trusting the inaccurate ratings by the Rating Agencies).


MY QUESTION:

Now, we have something called PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) for people who make less than a 20% down payment. It ensures that the issuer/holder of the loan (the bank itself / whoever the issuing bank sells the loan to) does not lose money in case the borrower defaults.

Now in 2023, what is stopping banks on just issuing loans to anyone with 3-5% as the down payment as long as they pay the PMI? In fact, at a deeper level, doesn't PMI incentivize banks to target people with less savings to purchase expensive loans?

Example - if a bank has a customer with 25% down payment available, the bank is still risking the 75% being defaulted on (since there is no PMI). If the house price drops significantly, the bank will have to bear the brunt of the loss (difference between the foreclosed selling price and 25% paid originally).

However if another customer has only a 3% downpayment available, the bank will simply slap on the PMI and issue the loan since it is now risk-free from the issuer's perspective.


Essentially, what's the difference between the PMI and the insurance issued pre-2008 by AIG-like companies? Haven't we just made the insurance more retail-based and less ""behind the scenes""?

&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

473,investing,"Hello everyone! I’m currently in my 30s and I have an important financial decision to make for next 10 years. Currently I have a full-time job as a Software engineer and I get around 100k per year. I’m from Ukraine where such rate is above market so I feel myself very good.

While my country is at war - I still think that investing is important since financial security in 30 years will be crucial. Our government institutions aren’t strong enough to provide for the elderly, so you have to think for yourself. Also you have to be a bit risk-tolerant since every real estate you own can be blown up by ru rocket/drone (just few days ago a house 100m from mine got hit and an apt was destroyed, people survived gladly).

I don’t intend to leave my home. Currently I have a real estate property valued around 150k. This is my apartment. Other than that - 20k on my bank accounts. I was able to register in IBKR and start investing. My first choice was VOO/QQQ/VT - 40/40/20%.

My strategy is simple: just put 1k per month into the funds for around 30 years.

I’m going to steadily decrease risk and go for low-earning things like treasure after some time. But for now I have a high risk tolerance.

Would you say that my portfolio is ok for my situation? Or do you think I should change it to something else?


UPD: some folks have raised doubts about this post being real. IT salaries in UA are ridiculously bigger than mid income of doctor/teacher/engineer. Like…up to 30x bigger. As a proof you can take a look at the latest quarterly poll of dev salaries in UA:

We paid it off this year.  The building is worth more now (probably 2.5 times more) and the tenants paid our mortgage and other expenses. 

The lessened learned for me is understand why you are getting into real estate going in.  Are you looking for wealth creation or cash flow?  If you want wealth generation then get a mortgage and have tenants pay mortgage and expenses. Don’t expect cash flow in this scenario.  You won’t get both cash flow and wealth creation. Over the years we had substantial cash built up but we also had substantial expenses.  We could have taken cash out but we would have had to put it back in when the large expenses came.  If you want cash flow, don’t have a mortgage. 

So now with mortgage paid off, reasonably secure tenants (hair salon and a coffee shop) and a number of improvements/ repairs recently done we are set to start getting some passive (mostly) cash flow.  It’s not life changing cash flow, but nice to have.  

Our tenants just got their modest annual 4% annual rent increase so cash flow set to grow.   In comes the property tax assessment…. 43% more!   In comes the insurance renewal, 41% increase!  15 years and not one claim!  So all of our rent increase will be going to the government and insurance company.

When it comes to investment opportunities relating to emerging/experimental technologies, it can be difficult for retail investors to find early-stage direct investment opportunities. 

BUT, the standout player, IonQ ($IONQ) is publicly traded. Here are some reasons why I’m bullish and think IonQ is oh, so special!

1. IonQ uses trapped ion/photonic computing!! This is really neat because it means their quantum computers do not need to be kept at FREEZING temps like QCs being created by Google, IBM, Rigetti and most others. (Among many other advantages) 

Compared to the trapped ion approach, the qubits generated via superconducting suffer from short coherence times, high error rates, limited connectivity, and higher estimated error-correction overhead

2. Management is fairly new to running a public company but they seem excited and dedicated based off interviews and press releases: “The lead is ours. And we have full intention to take advantage of it.”

3. IonQ is the first and only quantum hardware integrated with all major cloud platforms and software kits!

4. 80% of their system is made outside of the US

5. 55+ US patents, 136 US patents pending, 7 foreign patents, 99 foreign patents pending, 8 US trademarks, 11 US trademarks pending, 17 international trademarks, 7 international trademarks pending

6. Their approach for the near term is to form a limited number of strategic partnerships to develop solutions that open up quantum advantage in select industry sectors (chem, pharma, finance, logistics).

7. What I think sets them apart the most, besides trapped ion, is their focus on scalability. Since their inception, Peter Chapman, their CEO, has been stressing the importance of their QCs being modular, economical, and serviceable. THIS, in my opinion, is the way. Whereas Google and IBM will have huge, frozen, immobile QCs available to contract via the cloud, IonQ will have a portable, scalable product.

508,investing,"Hi folks,

Somewhere in your investment reading, you probably came across an observation which stated that, historically, the aggregate price-to-earnings ratio of stocks has been about 15.  I believe that this observation is generally made from United States stocks which make up the S&amp;P 500 index, dating back about 150 years.

But no matter how you measure it, the aggregate P/E ratio of stocks hasn't been lower than 15 for the past thirty years.  Depending on the time frame you use for earnings, the average P/E ratio these days is 25 to 30.

[https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio)

[https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)

I have been skeptical of stock investment for most of my adult life, and this P/E ratio discrepancy is a major reason why.  

If you ever took an economics class, you probably learned about ""opportunity costs,"" the costs of making a choice.  If interest rates are high, for example, the opportunity to invest in bonds or long-term high-yield bank accounts might look more attractive than stocks.

The last 18 months have seen interest rates increased to a level we haven't seen since the dot-com boom.  

[https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart)

Stock P/E ratios did move down, but not by very much, and a reversal is apparently now underway.

Has anyone read anything which attempts to explain why people in this generation are willing to pay almost twice as much for stocks, for the same amount of earnings?  I'm interested primarily in academic research.  I'm combing the Internet for leads, but it occurred to me that some of my fellow Redditors may already know where to find some answers.

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, this will lock in the current high interest rates for two years and I expect rates to comedown in the next 12 months given the recent low inflation numbers. It&amp;#39;s also hard to imagine that interest rates will increase much more than 5.25%, so the interest rate risk is a lot lower then when rates were at 0%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if I&amp;#39;m wrong on any of the above.&lt;/p&gt;

My bond ETF is down 18% since I bought it in late 2019. It has kicked out 4.9% in cash overall as a percentage of the amount invested.  My principal is significantly eroded, though. 

A 1 year GIC (here in Canada) currently pays 5.05%.  That’s a slightly better and safer move for new money I want on the fixed income side of things, right?  Or is it a case of buy the bond ETF low given the return is almost the same as the GIC?

While I've been satisfied with the returns and overall performance of the automated service, I've come to realize that there are certain advantages to having a  flesh-and-blood advisor. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Firstly, there's the social and networking aspect. By engaging with a local Financial Advisor, I could potentially tap into their extensive network and connect with other accomplished professionals and business owners. 
* Secondly, I value having someone to discuss and bounce ideas off of, especially when it comes to delving into the nitty-gritty details of stock and investment selections. Studying through books and such are fine, but people learn best through face-to-face social interactions to increase their understanding from books and youtube videos.

I've scheduled face-to-face meetings with a few FAs for next month. Are there any warning signs I should be mindful of or specific questions I should ask during these meetings?

1. The plan as a whole
2. The accounts/banks I am planning to use, do these seem like reputable banks and good choices? Is it a mistake to open so many different account with different banks or no problem?

5. Anything that I'm missing that I should consider adding to this plan?

General guidelines I am planning to follow:

    1. $10,000 in checking
    
    2. Make max contribution to ROTH IRA annually ($6500 for 2023).
    
    3. Contribute to 401k up to employer matched 6%
    
    4. 20,000 in savings.
    
    5. The rest(around 100k) either goes into the brokerage or 70-80% brokerage and 20-30% CD's/Bonds. 
    		
    
    6. Brokerage investments mostly in index funds, maybe throw some money into a stock or two that look promising, everything in index funds for starters.

&lt;li&gt;Values/Percentages for the different accounts/goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brokerage index funds vs CD vs Bonds, still not sure what I will do with that 100k, how would you do it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything that I&amp;#39;m missing that I should consider adding to this plan?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General guidelines I am planning to follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. $10,000 in checking

2. Make max contribution to ROTH IRA annually ($6500 for 2023).

3. Contribute to 401k up to employer matched 6%

4. 20,000 in savings.

5. The rest(around 100k) either goes into the brokerage or 70-80% brokerage and 20-30% CD&amp;#39;s/Bonds. 


6. Brokerage investments mostly in index funds, maybe throw some money into a stock or two that look promising, everything in index funds for starters. 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accounts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (In general these are all new account that I will have to open and move money into, the only exception being that I already have a brokerage with Fidelity)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.nbkc.com/personal/everything-account""&gt;Checking&lt;/a&gt;@ 1.5APY (Right now I have a checking through US Bank, I figured I might as well look into an account with interest while I&amp;#39;m setting all of this up)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cit.com/cit-bank/bank/savings/platinum-savings-account""&gt;Savings&lt;/a&gt;@ 4.95APY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combination Checking and Savings&lt;/strong&gt; @ 0.5 and 4.4 APY (Requires direct deposit monthly for good rates, easier to manage than having two account with two banks): &lt;strong&gt;SoFi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As a result of the rebalance, you should expect Nasdaq to [significantly decrease the weight of the largest stocks](https://www.tastylive.com/news-insights/everything-you-need-to-know-about-what-will-happen-to-the-nasdaq-after-the-special-rebalance) ($MSFT, $AAPL, $GOOGL/$GOOG, $NVDA, and $AMZN) from a total of 43+% to below a 38.5% maximum. TSLA may also see a small downward weighting. Smaller stocks should see a small increase in the weight.

ETFs/mutual funds that try to follow the Nasdaq 100 (such as $QQQ) will need to adjust their holdings accordingly. So you should expect them to sell the largest stocks and buy the smaller ones -- perhaps they already have -- and that will affect the prices of those stocks accordingly.

It also means that those ETFs/mutual funds will not accurately reflect the relative weight of the largest stocks. So if you wish to be weighted according to actual market cap, you would need to supplement those holdings.

Normally the index rebalances every quarter. But the largest stocks are dominating the index and funds that follow the index need to maintain compliance with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule on fund diversification. On July 3, the largest six stocks saw their combined weight reach 50.9% of the index.

Just getting into Investing and currently have £5000 in a Index Fund with Vanguard.

My partner has a small nest egg of £16000 that is for all intents and purposes doing nothing, i've explained to her that inflation is just eating that away every year and she is happy to invest it in something similar with me.

We also have a joint savings of around £13500 we are thinking of investing.

This leads to my question; surely we are better opening up a joint account and putting all of it in one place to benefit from compound interest, rather than have '£5000 here, £16000 there, £13500 over here'... am i right in this or off the mark?

582,investing,"So I have some bond holdings in my Vanguard Roth IRA which is some of the bond % I hold in my total portfolio to aim for a 90%/10% equities/bond ratio. The Vanguard Roth IRA bonds I hold are in VBTLX (total bond market index) currently, which shows a ""30-day SEC yield as of 07/06/2023"" of 4.41% and ""fund average annual returns"" of 1.48% (last 10 years). Not entirely sure if the yield (which is dividends it pays I believe) are in addition to the annual returns (share price increase).

I just noticed that any funds put into my Roth IRA go into the ""settlement fund"" which appears to be held in VMFXX (Vanguard federal money market fund). That fund shows a ""30-day SEC yield as of 07/06/2023"" of 5.04% and ""fund average annual returns"" of 0.94% (last 10 years). This appears to be much closer to the federal funds rate (even higher than my HYSA with Capital One which is at 4.15% APY).

So my questions are...

1. How much does VBTLX return on average per year? Is the math 4.41% (dividends) + 1.48% (share price increase average over last 10 years) = 5.89%/year? Or is the 1.48%/year average including the current 4.41% yield? Similarly for the VMFXX ""settlement fund""... does it return 5.04% + 0.94% = 5.98%/year on average for the past 10 years? Or is the 0.94%/year (over last 10 years average) factoring in the current 5.04% rate?

1. It appears the settlement fund relies on ""cash &amp; US government securities"" instead of VBTLX for example which relies on ""U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities of all maturities"". Vanguard describes the VMFXX fund as ""one of the most conservative investment options offered by Vanguard"" and it also yields more (5.04% I believe) than the bond fund currently (4.41% I believe ?).

590,investing,"Is BIZD a reasonable addition to my roth?

I'm not planning on putting more than 5% into the fund.

BIZD is an ETF which holds business development corporations, which in turn hold their own portfolios of privately held companies which they provide capital to, which can include buyouts, loans, and other means of financing. Given that BDCs are basically little closed end funds, they aren't held by ITOT, the total market fund i used.

Given their absence from the total market fund, and the potential diversification i could gain through having access to non publicly traded companies, I'm considering putting this into my roth, where I won't pay double taxes on dividends.

The expense ratio (on paper) is ~10%, but this is due to the expenses of the businesses it owns. The cost of the fund itself is 0.4%. The only competition in the bdc etf space is an active fund with ~0.7% expenses.

612,investing,"Jacob Lund Fisker of Early Retirement Extreme fame has written this [blog post](https://earlyretirementextreme.com/the-major-risks-of-buy-and-hold-index-investing.html) on the future risks of index investing. 

My interpretation of his argument is this: Due to demographics changes in the west (more old people, not enough young people to replace them), there will come a tipping point where the ""selling pressure"" from old people selling their index fund stocks in their retirement will succeed the ""buying pressure"" from young people buying into index funds, which will push the average returns down for many years. I can't really judge if he says the returns will go negative or just be less than the high returns we have become used to.

My uneducated take is that even if the returns are pushed down in the coming decades, then index funds will still be a good place to, because owning companies even in a declining economy is still better than holding cash or other assets which do not produce a return, because much of the money that the state outputs ends up at these companies. Furthermore, I hope that technological trends will continue to improve productivity, so that company value will rise accordingly even though there are less able workers. I also think less than the 7% average annual return that has been normal for many years is acceptable. It has always seemed crazy and unsustainable to me that we just get that ""for free"". So for these reasons, I will still be investing in index funds.

But to be fair to Jacob, he is not opposed to investing in good companies, just in index funds. So same approximate oppinion as Buffet and Munger. That makes sense from his point of view, since he has been able to produce outsized returns by stockpicking, which is not necessarily something that average people can emulate.

Jacob is someone whose intellect and way of life I respect greatly, so when he says something that goes counter to the prevailing way of doing things, I don't want to dismiss that out of hand. Jacob is basically saying that the common pension scheme of just investing in S&amp;P 500 and living of the returns of that in retirement is not sustainable in the coming decades, with the way demographics in the west is going.

614,investing,"Hello everyone. For context, I am using more technical analysis and validating some of the more risky (higher beta/duration) securities validated by double checking the fundamentals. I have taken particular interest into ""Smart beta"" and CAPM (Capital asset pricing model). 

My way of thinking is that there is no major difference in returns (IN THE LONG RUN) between a diversified portfolio that results in an average beta of, say 1.4, and has lots of risk that cannot be diversified away, compared to a portfolio that has that same average beta with little unsystematic risk.  The assumption then leads to having a portfolio with higher betas to effectively capture the highs and short the lows have higher returns. My strategy is slightly dated- I am going to use higher betas to capture gains in a bull market. 

I intend to have a substantial base of a mix of index funds and Short-term treasurys (70%) and the ""Smart beta"" strategy will consist of 25%. 5% will consist of TIPS savings bonds. I feel like I could potentially beat the market if I commit to these terms. 

&amp;#x200B;

More specifically, my process is to search for more of those value securities (NASDAQ and NYSE only). To do this, I'm looking for decent companies that have a lower price earnings and price-to-book ratios. Furthermore, I intend to set a minimum beta at 1.75. 

I've have decent and tested success with this, and I've successfully chose companies such as Transocean (RIG) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) and so far YoY my portfolio consisting of this portion of high-beta stocks has returned 206%, and overall my portfolio returned 26% YoY. It's been a great year, so I am oblivious to the long-term performance of this strategy, but I think in the long run I should be able to beat the market by a 100 bps or so.

One last important fundamental note is that for this to work effectively, these ""Smart Beta"" securities need to be issued by small-cap companies, which they are generally more affected by other forms of risk (such as inflation, idiosyncratic, over-leveraging, etc). So in theory, I need many more winners than losers, and I think will be hard to come by.

I&amp;#39;m open to learning what anyone has to say about these two options. Currently leaning more toward the T-Bills since I can benefit from the lack of State tax on the interest gains.

Signs it is a Ponzi:

Claims to be “crypto trading” but the “expert traders” are positive over 99% of the time.  (Unlicensed securities and overly consistent gains)

Returns are always 4-5% every month without fail, they have never had a negative month. (Overly consistent returns). They post “daily gains” and it’s positive 99% of the time. 

“Fund managers” are all overseas and “remain anonymous to avoid doxxing”

Returns are positive no matter if crypto markets are up, down, or flat. 

No 3rd party independent audits

No proof of actually even making any trades. 

If you pull out money you have to wait 90 days to make any gains after you deposit more money (pressure to reinvest and not pull out money)

Please note, this is not our only investments and the majority of our investments are otherwise well diversified (index, ETFs) and in a variety of asset classes.

I am keen to teach her some fundamentals along the way. 

Technical analysis at this stage is out - we are looking broadly at fundamental analysis - industry, sector, macro, news etc. and will slowly be taking her through a company's financials etc. as we progress. We are investing for the long term so are not interested in short term trading etc. 

Has anyone done anything similar and can recommend a structure or any resources that might help? 

Our money is not pooled together, the plan is to action the same trades - we are using a platform that enables us to buy parts of shares for smaller amounts that we can afford to risk.

644,investing,"Hi there,

I am in my early 30's and want to diversify 90/10 stocks/bonds. I have decided on treasury notes/bonds as they have a bit of negative correlation to stocks especially during a bear market like we just experienced. The goal is to hedge against drawdown but my time horizon isn't at least for another 20+ years.

I am having trouble deciding between either a short-term treasury ETF (e.g. VGSH/SCHO) or a long-term treasury ETF (e.g. VGLT/SCHQ). My current understanding is short-term seems to cushion drawdown better than long-term does, but long-term has better yields and supposedly have a higher negative beta which means they should theoretically behave as a better hedge on stocks. Obviously long-term are more sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and we have seen a -20%+ drawdown on long-term bonds as a result of recent Fed rate hikes, whereas short-term notes only saw a much smaller drawdown of 3-4%.

I'm torn. On one hand, short-term treasuries seem to accomplish the goal better, while on the other hand, long-term treasuries (under normal circumstances) have a higher yield. Either way, prices are low and it seems like a good time to buy. Any thoughts are appreciated!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m torn. On one hand, short-term treasuries seem to accomplish the goal better, while on the other hand, long-term treasuries (under normal circumstances) have a higher yield. Either way, prices are low and it seems like a good time to buy. Any thoughts are appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

652,investing,"***TLDR: I think Hasbro is going to spike after its earnings report and I wanted to share why I think this.***

***Disclosure***: as of right now, my financial interest in Hasbro comes from a dozen puts I sold Thursday morning when the price dropped below $63. Truth be told, though, I expect to buy back that put for a profit tomorrow or early next week before making my real move.

While I am not a fan of buying options (like many, I've lost money in the past doing so), in this situation I feel pretty strongly that my forecast that Hasbro will go up is correct. ***So I intend to buy a healthy amount of call options in Hasbro sometime next week.***

The core reason? The premium Magic: the Gathering set release of Lord of the Rings. This is a Magic set using the IP of Tolkein's Lord of the Rings trilogy as a 'skin.' This is extremely nerdy, I know, but also... this is Reddit. Most of you probably are familiar with both Lord of the Rings (obviously) and Magic (to a lesser extent).

Now, this set was alway projected to do well so some of Hasbro's projected earnings already are baked in. That being said, I think those original projections are being outstripped by the popularity of the set and sustained market interest.

***Background:*** Magic accounts for close to 70% of Hasbro's profitability (their Wizards of the Coast is credited with a full 70%, but it is important to note that Magic ***is*** Wizards). A strong spike in Magic sales will absolutely impact earnings per share. As of right now, Hasbro is projected to report earnings of $0.57 per share.

Most of the hype around this set has been due to a special one-of-a-kind card, The One Ring, which is serialized 1/1. It was only available in a premium product (Collector Box) that initially started at $350/box (there is another premium product it could be found in, but this is tangential to the main plot). There were publicly-declared offers for this card, the highest of which was $2.1 million USD.

Pre-orders on this box gradually grew more expensive, cracking $400/box and even $500/box before the premium One Ring was reported found last week. From there, the box price tanked back down to $350, but then a curious thing happened... the price rose to above $400 again. This was not expected by the vast majority of Magic players, collectors and investors.

Now, there are other cards that are serialized and, therefore, of high value (i.e., four-figures)--but none of these come close to the vale of The One Ring. There had been widespread speculation that once the The One Ring was found the Collector Boxes would tank and stay low, but that turned out to be wrong.

Overall, the prices and volumes of the set have remained very strong--including for boxes and bundles that are sold at lower price points, and which do not contain the super-rare chase cards. The Tolkein fanbase is considerably larger than Magic's fanbase (there is considerable overlap, of course) and the demand for the cards appears to be going strong--stronger than is typical for when demand is driven by the players alone.

Because Hasbro sells these products to distributors in advance, a significant percentage of this demand will be captured in the earnings report--both from the initial wave of orders, as well as from any second wave occurring in the weeks after the set released (which was in mid/late June).

***Narrative:*** Hasbro routinely finds ways to proclaim a new set the ""best-selling BLANK of all time"": best-selling summer set, winter set, core set, commander set, etc. However, this time, they should easily be able to proclaim that this set is the ***best-selling Magic set of all-time.***

Further, given that the price points for these cards are about 50% higher than regular set releases, the profits should be meaningful, even after accounting for what must be a hefty licensing fee paid to the Tolkein Estate.

Given that the set is still in demand and will be sold for a year or longer, Hasbro will be able to present a narrative of: 1) higher-than-expected EPS, 2) best-selling set of all time, and 3) the set continuing to have high demand for the foreseeable future. ***I think this is a pretty good recipe for a solid spike in stock price after earnings are reported.***","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TLDR: I think Hasbro is going to spike after its earnings report and I wanted to share why I think this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

672,investing,"When read about the SP500’s average returns in the newspaper or any other media, it’s usually referencing returns since 1928, which are about 7.4%. This paints a significantly distorted view of the market. 

For example, if you move beyond the Great Depression, things start to look very different, very fast. If you start in 1937–also a bad year in the market, but often referenced as the beginning of the real recovery (others point to the start of WWII)—returns look MUCH different:

Stock market returns since 1937: 10.33%

This is an absolutely enormous difference, and I think a far more accurate look at modern markets. The Great Depression is almost certainly never going to happen again without a far more significant worldwide disaster. For one, governments have learned that intervention is necessary to sustain economic stability. FDR brought this lesson to America in resounding fashion. But also, technologically, the likelihood of such an economic disaster without an underlying disaster is very low. As many say, if stocks fall 80-90%, we will likely be dealing with much bigger problems than our portfolios. Additionally, I also think we are creating wealth at more rapid rates. Perhaps this won’t affect the SP500, but I think it will, especially as multiples continue to expand in the face of asset-light business models coming to dominate the market more than more. 

I’m not sure why 1928 is the chosen benchmark. Perhaps it’s when markets started collecting accurate data. But I think it’s an arbitrary year that creates a great deal of distortion in perceived market returns. You could also return to a much earlier period to even out the effects of the Depression. But 1937 allows us to start at the dawn of the modern American era, while also avoiding the risk of cherry-picking a great year of returns. It marked the vestiges of the Depression hammering the markets, and a new day of both recovery and adversity ahead of us.

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure why 1928 is the chosen benchmark. Perhaps it’s when markets started collecting accurate data. But I think it’s an arbitrary year that creates a great deal of distortion in perceived market returns. You could also return to a much earlier period to even out the effects of the Depression. But 1937 allows us to start at the dawn of the modern American era, while also avoiding the risk of cherry-picking a great year of returns. It marked the vestiges of the Depression hammering the markets, and a new day of both recovery and adversity ahead of us. &lt;/p&gt;

My fiancé and I (28yo) are looking to buy a house in &gt;=5 years. We are looking for something in the 500k-600k range, and definitely want 20% down, most likely split 50-50 between the two of us.

So my target is ~$70k to cover my half plus closing, moving expenses, etc. Right now I have ~$22k in Series I (bought in 2021 and 2022). I also have ~$15k in broad market ETF. Monthly I save $3000 after maxing 401K/IRA. Recently I’ve just been DCA into ETF every month, but I’m thinking I may want to start diverting some of this monthly savings into bonds or HYSA.

I have been having my emergency fund in checking account for over an year without any interest.  One of the main reasons for doing this was most high yield savings acc required the acc holder to be a Resident Alien or U.S citizens to be having this account, which I am not one.

Now, finally I have decided to open a brokerage account in Fidelity to hold a FDRXX (government cash reserve) and hold it in the brokerage account to earn interest. 

How bad or good idea is this, since as these yield curves pretty much mimic the interest rates provided by banks when there is a change as they hold similar government and bank issued bonds in it.

Is there anything I should consider or be doing different or risk factors I should be considering before completely moving the checking acc fund to FDRXX

[You own units in the ETF and the ETF provider owns the shares or assets](https://moneysmart.gov.au/managed-funds-and-etfs/exchange-traded-funds-etfs).

From The Street:

* ETF shareholders do not own the underlying assets included in the ETFs they invest in. For this reason, they do not get the voting rights that normal stock shares might come with.

&gt;Unrealized losses on bonds and loans held by U.S. banks are expected to have grown in the second quarter, potentially reanimating an issue that made investors nervous earlier this year. Meanwhile, pressure on profits is rising.

&gt;A resilient economy and a steadier banking system caused market values for debt to generally fall in the quarter, reflecting expectations the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates higher for longer. At the same time, the rates banks pay on deposits and other funding sources have risen while returns on their fixed-rate assets stay low.

&gt;Unrealized losses “should be pretty close to back to where we were at the end of 2022 for the vast majority of banks,” said Richard Sbaschnig, an analyst at the investment-research firm CFRA. “It still feels like there’s some liquidity pressure on the banks, although obviously the risk of an immediate failure seems to have dropped precipitously.”

&gt;Lower debt prices reduce the value of trillions of dollars in assets that banks hold, regardless of whether they intend to sell the bonds or loans. Investors at the start of this year grew uneasy with the magnitude of these unrealized losses, which topped $600 billion following the Fed’s campaign to sharply raise interest rates in 2022.

&gt;In some cases, the losses were equal to or greater than banks’ equity, or the buffer they hold to absorb such hits. That led to a crisis that brought down three regional banks earlier this year. But the ensuing volatility gave banks a reprieve: Investors seeking safety bought Treasury debt, lowering benchmark yields and helping raise prices across debt markets, including those for banks’ fixed-rate assets.

&gt;The relative calm of the just-ended second quarter, though, has lowered the market values of many bank assets as yields on Treasury debt rose.

&gt;Two-year Treasury yields finished the quarter at 4.88%, up from 4.06% as of March 31. Ten-year Treasurys were yielding 3.82%, up from 3.49% as of March 31. Values of fixed-rate bonds decline as yields increase. Mortgage rates rose last quarter, too, as did yields on government-sponsored mortgage bonds.

&gt;“Based on the higher yield requirements by investors, you’ll see lower prices and lower fair values on securities and on loans, too,” said Frank Wilary, principal at Wilary Winn, an advisory firm that helps banks and credit unions determine fair-value measurements for their financial reports.

&gt;A resurgence of unrealized losses could raise fresh concerns about banks’ health. Many lenders also could face deposit outflows and earnings pressure.

&gt;**Banks, for example, are borrowing heavily under the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program, created after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. That program had a record $103.1 billion of loans outstanding last week. Such loans, now at a fixed rate of 5.50%, must be repaid within a year and are considered a relatively expensive source of liquidity.**

&gt;Since peaking in April 2022, deposits industrywide had declined about 5% as of June 21, according to Fed data. Some lenders, including PacWest Bancorp, recently have been selling chunks of their loan books to boost liquidity.

&gt;PacWest last week said it agreed to sell a $3.5 billion loan portfolio, including unfunded commitments, to a group of funds run by Ares Management. PacWest said the deal’s first round included loans with an outstanding principal balance of about $2.1 billion and generated about $2.0 billion of cash proceeds for the bank.  

&gt;Silicon Valley Bank collapsed days after the 2-year Treasury yield topped 5%. Its failure was precipitated by outsize bond losses combined with an unusually high concentration of uninsured deposits, which ultimately led to a run on the bank. Signature Bank failed soon afterward, triggered by a run on deposits after it suffered reputational damage from its dealings with crypto companies. First Republic Bank failed weeks later, burdened by high uninsured deposits and large unrealized losses on its fixed-rate loan portfolio.

&gt;For a while, Treasury yields fell sharply, reflecting investors’ belief that the risk of toppling more regional banks could prompt the Fed to slow interest-rate increases. Since early May, however, Treasury yields have been rising, while the brief panic in the banking sector has subsided.

&gt;U.S. banks’ unrealized losses on investment securities were $515.5 billion as of March 31, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That was down from $617.8 billion at the end of 2022 and their Sept. 30 peak of $689.9 billion. More than half of such losses each quarter were on bonds classified as “held-to-maturity,” and so not included on banks’ balance sheets under the accounting rules. At the end of 2021, unrealized losses on bondholdings were negligible systemwide.

&gt;**The FDIC doesn’t publish fair-value data for loans, and only banks that are publicly traded are required to report such data. For the current 24 members of the KBW Bank Index, unrealized losses on loans were $120 billion as of March 31, down from $153 billion at year-end, according to a Wall Street Journal review of their filings.

&lt;p&gt;I do have access to international banks etc and the financial system is well integrated with US and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking to invest around 15% of my check every month and hoping to cash it out in 25-30 years. I&amp;#39;d work out the specific maths later, but need to understand If I can even invest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local investment options are not reliable on long-term basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appreciate your feedback,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

I've already purchased the max amt of ibonds, but now I want to add in  intermediate, and long term bonds. (not as interested in short term bonds, because MMFs seem to offer about the same rates with more liquitidy, so they don't seem like as much of an opportunity atm, to me personally)

QUESTION:

Concerning intermediate and long term bonds: **Will the 2 supposed upcoming rate hikes by the end of the year most likely INCREASE bond yields (and lower bond prices), or not?**

Meaning, **would it most likely be better to** ***wait*** **to purchase intermediate and long term bonds, until AFTER the fed finishes hiking rates** (which supposedly they will do two more times by the end of the year) ?

TLDR: How should the 2 upcoming (supposed) rate hikes affect my purchase decision of intermediate and and long term bonds? Should I wait to buy these bonds until after the fed finished hiking rates..or just buy them now?

Thanks for all insights and replies!

\----------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE:

Alright, as often is the case on reddit, I go and research the answer myself and come back with my findings.

In this case, because I have been researching bonds on and off for about 2 months now, I happen to have taken a screenshot of bond yields (as listed on schwab's website) in May 2023, which I can compare to the current yields.

(I'm trying to add a screenshot of this to this post, but I don't see the insert image button anywhere.)

But to summarize: Yields (APY/YTM) are up across the board (since May 2023), about 10-20 basis points, since the last rate hike on May 3rd, which was +25 bps.

For example, on Schwab's bond page:

* In may (before the last rate hike)  the highest 10-yr bond APY/YTM was 3.43, today it is 3.86
* The highest 30 yr bond APY/YTM was 3.75, today it is 3.86
* The highest 3 year bond APY/YTM was 5.05, today it is 5.35
* etc, across the board

This tells me that a +25 bp increases yields across the board by 10-30 points. (or that's my conclusion so far)

2nd EDIT: Actually the yield for the 3 month Tbill has gone down since may, unlike every other fixed income class. In May the 3-month ATM was 5.25, today it is 5.12

3rd EDIT: Actually, looking at the yield history, the yields have gone up and down (slightly) all year, and even though we are at highest rates, the bond yields were higher back in jan 2023...So maybe the correlation isn't as immediate as I thought...

20k- individual stocks

My bonds are held as risk-free asset to make some money until I use them to pay off debt.

Now that student loans are restarting, I'm unsure if I should pay the minimum monthly payment with REPAYE or pay it off instantly.

Here's how I see it: I expect the SP500 to return me 8% annualized, guaranteed. I know this is not how people see it but I can tolerate downturns (such as 2022). The 5% guaranteed return from one of my loans I will clear as the interest arbitrage is not worth it imo but 4.25% and 3.5% I will keep indefinitely while rates are above 5%.

Thoughts?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all, would love advice on how I could leverage student loans. 24M with no plans on getting married soon, live with parents so rent is cheap. Pre-tax salary is 85k, post-tax is 62k, monthly pay is 5160. I&amp;#39;m not afraid of debt, as long as it costs less than the market &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monthly expenses- $1500. No debt other than 30k soon to be active student debt. I have no car loans and no mortgage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt Breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20k- 3.5%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5k- 4.25%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5k- 5%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live below my means and invest the rest of the money. I max out my roth IRA every year but do not contribute to a 401k as I might need to liquidate part of my portfolio to survive once I get into dental school and I don&amp;#39;t want to take a loan against my 401k and pay it back with post-tax dollars &lt;/p&gt;

After many years of waiting for ""the crash"" that seems to never come, I am ready to just put everything I have to work and wait.

**Company ROTH IRA (Currently uninvested)**

**Company HSA (Currently uninvested)** \- $611 Balance ($0 of $7,500 limit applied in 2023)

Wife also has some investment accounts through her work 403b but they are actively invested and I won't touch those yet. She is maybe hitting $13,000 of her $22,500 yearly limit so can I put more into my own company after-tax Roth to make up the difference?

&amp;#x200B;

CLIFF NOTES:

I've cost myself lots of money by being uninvested for 10+ years.

Currently $107,685.20 total uninvested. 

Could probably afford to dip a little more into our combined paychecks.

Nothing being invested in company HSA. 

Nothing new being invested to old rollover IRA.

Nothing being invested in company Post Tax IRA.

Wife below her 403b yearly contribution limit.

I cannot find a SINGLE article (I mean it, not one) about the duration-allocation WITHIN the bond section of your portfolio. Ie - which percentages of your bond portfolio should go to short, intermediate, and long-term bonds. Or how to even determine this answer.

For example, if you decide to have 30% percent of your portfolio allocated to bonds, and let's say that that amount is $200,000 - how much of that $200k should go to long, intermediate, and short term bonds? What questions should you be asking yourself to determine this?

I know there isnt a single ""right"" answer out there, and that everybody will be different, but if anybody here knows of any studies, or articles about the topic of allocation of bond length WITHIN your bond portfolio (*not* total allocation of portfolio to bonds) , or has any thoughts/knowledge about it, I would be grateful to hear them.

My reason for asking this question is that I think now is a good time to invest in bonds of all lengths, but determining which percentage to invest in which lengths is stumping me, because I don't know the right questions to ask myself to come up with a solid answer.

Thanks in advance for any insights!

*PS: Some might mention just getting bond funds/etfs, but I personally am more interested in purchasing outright bonds.*

The above is an Ontario Superior Court case where Questrade, a major, Toronto-based independent online broker, sued a client for $10,000. From the headnote (TL;DR below):

\[3\] The appellant and her husband are two of the three owners of an account with the respondent. The respondent is a discount brokerage. The account was one which allowed trading on margin, which is to say, on money borrowed from the respondent. Beginning at or around June 29, 2007, until July 26, 2007, the appellant and her two colleagues purchased shares in a corporation referred to in the material as Beazer Homes US. Between June 29, 2007 and August 1, 2007, the price of the shares in Beazer Homes declined. On the appeal, it was submitted that on July 31, 2007, an e-mail was delivered by the respondent to the appellant indicating that the account was under-margin and requiring that this difficulty be dealt with by 2 p.m. on August 2, 2007. The e-mail indicated that, after that time, the respondent would exercise its right to clear the under-margin ""by covering your open positions"".

\[4\] On August 1, 2007, at 10:50 a.m., the respondent liquidated the account. It did this without waiting until 2 p.m. on August 2, 2007, as it had said it would in its e-mail of July 31, 2007. Even with the liquidation of the account, the appellant and her colleagues continued to be indebted to the respondent in the amount of $10,569.06. At the same time, the liquidation resulted in a loss to the appellant and her colleagues reported in the decision of the trial judge as being in the amount of $53,984. As a result, the respondent sued the appellant for $10,000 and the appellant ""filed a defendant's claim"" seeking payment of $25,000. These are the claims the trial judge ruled on and it is that decision which the appellant brings to this Court.

TL;DR:

The client lost a lot of money on a bad trade in their Questrade margin account, in a company called Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (NYSE: BZH). NOTE: this is a major U.S. corporation that is highly liquid. It has a market cap of $900 million and average daily volume of about 300,000 shares, or about $90 million in daily turnover, as at July 3, 2023.

In July of 2007 the client was long BZH in her Questrade margin account, and had borrowed money from Questrade on margin, to buy the stock. During that month, the price of BZH experienced a rapid decline, and toward the end of the month the client went into a margin violation due to insufficient margin.

On July 31, 2007 Questrade emailed the client saying that they were in a margin violation, and gave them until 2:00pm on August 2, 2007, to either sell shares, deposit more shares or deposit cash.

Questrade then liquidated the account, before the deadline in the email, without notice.

The client's account was wiped out and Questrade ended up losing money as the loss ate into the loan, to the tune of about $10,000.

Questrade then sued for $10,000 and the client counterclaimed. Questrade won.

So my question is this: There was about a $54,000 loss to the client, and a $10,000 loss to Questrade, in a major U.S. corporation that is highly liquid. In July of 2007, the shares were trading for on average $100 a share and average daily volume was about 600,000 shares, therefore, the turnover was $60 million a day. So this was an insignificant position from a liquidity standpoint.

So Questrade should easily have been able to liquidate the account without itself losing money.

I therefore question the competence of Questrade's margin monitoring systems, at least at the time.

Comments? Anyone from Questrade care to comment? The case is at CanLII.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Edited for grammar.

728,investing,"Hi all, hopefully this is a common enough question that someone's developed some strategies.

I'm 30, so naturally my porfolio is stock-heavy. Roth IRA and 401(k) are both in target date funds (&gt;95% stock); taxable account is a random mix of international and domestic index funds.

I've been doing a lot of reading &amp; research about different asset allocation strategies (fascinating btw!), and would like to:

 * start automatically investing monthly in my taxable account (Roth IRA and 401(k) maxed)
 * expand my portfolio to include a modest amount of REITs, preferably in Roth IRA
 * expand my portfolio to include a *small* amount of bonds, preferably in 401(k)
 * maybe distinguish between developed &amp; emerging int'l markets
 * maybe distinguish by domestic stock types (large cap, small, etc.)

At this point, is it best to ditch the target date funds in my tax-advantaged accounts so I can have more control over asset allocation? Have I officially ""leveled up"" beyond the simplicity those funds offer?

I guess I'm looking for any advice on taking the training wheels off a bit and having more granular control over my investments.

&lt;p&gt;They show the same fund DFSVX but one has $10k turning into $239k over the lifetime of the fund while the other only £35k. The $239k feels correct to me, perhaps the other doesn&amp;#39;t take into account reinvested dividends or something?&lt;/p&gt;

733,investing,"The recent successful stress tests have opened up the opportunity to discuss dividend increases. I wrote about banks a couple of days ago, so let me jog your memory: large banks had held off on announcing dividends and buybacks this year as they awaited clarification on the Federal Reserve's regulatory actions, along with the final version of Basel III.

Now that they have a better understanding of the landscape, these banks are beginning to announce their plans for returning cash to shareholders.

Here's the rundown:

* JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. intends to increase its quarterly dividend from $1 per share to $1.05.
* Morgan Stanley is planning to hike theirs from 76 cents to 85 cents per share.
* Wells Fargo &amp; Co. is looking at a boost from 30 to 35 cents.
* Goldman Sachs Group has proposed raising their dividend from $2.50 to $2.75 per share.
* Citigroup Inc.'s board of directors has greenlit a dividend increase from 51 cents to 53 cents per share, although the bank's minimum capital requirement has been lifted from 12% to 12.3% following the stress tests.

In addition to the above, Morgan Stanley has announced a new buyback program worth up to $20 billion. Executives from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have also indicated that their banks are financially ready for buybacks.

So far, so good. Things are looking bright, and believe me, I'm neither yawning nor complaining. However, I am still reserving caution when it comes to the question of regional banks. Despite the good news, risks still exist, and it's crucial not to lose sight of them, even in a bull market.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent successful stress tests have opened up the opportunity to discuss dividend increases.

737,investing,"I was just wondering the mechanism by which a stock like Domino's Pizza can zoom by over 3,000% over a decade and still only have a market cap of 11B. I was looking to see how they fare as an investment, given all the other struggling businesses, and if I had bought in 2010, it looks to have been a better investment than Apple, but the difference is that Domino's evaporates their money while Apple doesn't, even though the stock chart only shows more climbing. I have seen other charts like this, but this may be one of the more egregious examples.

My best theory is that they are reducing the amount of shares in circulation steadily over time to keep the price high. So I wonder a couple things: would an investor have actually made 3,000% during this time period, or would their holdings be continually adjusted to reflect the shares float? I guess I'm confusing that with split rules, but it doesn't make sense to make that much money on a business that's barely solvent. And my other question is, if someone had enough cash to short a high-priced stock like this today, would it be a good play given the fragility of the space and the way the stock has been manipulated? I would expect nothing but a quick catastrophe from such a bad business model.

I have a hard time gaining traction and support for my reddit threads when I make them, so I just want to clarify what was eyebrow-raising about the subject of this post. If the market cap is 11B, and they show growth of 3,300% over 13 years, then their capitalization must have been like $3.50, a couple of spare buttons and some pocket lint. Whatever they were doing to keep their graph looking nice while either losing or stagnating could not have helped the overall health of the stock. I think a symptom of the disease they gave themself is that despite a market cap of only 11B, the share price is over $300. I suppose they could split their shares, but it'd have to be like 20-to-1 to have their share price make sense for their market cap.
Anyway I didn't mean anything bad by this post, I'm just probably not altogether coherent, but who really is? Who among you has all their ducks in a row, their head seated firmly upon their shoulders? I'm skeptical about the stability of my critics. I'd say they're all similarly flying by the seat of their pants as I am wont to do.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was just wondering the mechanism by which a stock like Domino&amp;#39;s Pizza can zoom by over 3,000% over a decade and still only have a market cap of 11B.

750,investing,"[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/inventor-of-balance-sheet-recession-says-china-is-now-in-one) - China is falling into a “balance-sheet recession” and needs to ramp up fiscal stimulus quickly to address the challenge, according to the economist who coined the phrase to explain Japan’s descent into stagnation in the 1990s.

“China is entering balance-sheet recession,” said Richard Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Japan’s biggest brokerage. “People are no longer borrowing money,” due to concern about asset prices and the outlook for economic growth, and are instead “trying to reduce their debt” — a key element of the condition Koo defined decades ago.

Because of diminished appetite in the private sector to borrow and spend, the government needs to step in, he said. “The government should not waste time on monetary easing, or structural reform policies that economists love to talk about,” he said.

Koo’s concept has been widely discussed in Chinese economic and financial circles in the last year. He defines a balance-sheet recession as a situation in which households and businesses divert more of their income toward paying down debt, rather than consuming or investing. Koo argues that was a key reason for Japan’s descent into deflation, and for the slow US and European recoveries from the 2008 financial crisis.

In China, evidence is seen in a slump in mortgage borrowing, decline in house prices and reluctance among private sector companies to borrow and invest. Inflation has fallen close to zero this year — another sign of weak demand in the economy. But China’s awareness of the phenomenon should be an advantage, Koo said.

“There are already people talking about a balance-sheet recession in China — that was not the case in the US in 2008 or Japan in 1990,” he said. “The key difference is now the doctor knows what the disease is.”

The government needs to step in as a borrower-of-last resort to maintain spending that then provides households and business with income they can use to repair their balance sheets, until they are confident enough to resume borrowing.

“If the government puts in speedy, sufficient and sustained fiscal stimulus, then there’s no reason for Chinese GDP to collapse,” he said. The top priority is to ensure that builders complete unfinished projects, he added. 

While China’s property slump offers a parallel to Japan’s case in the 1990s, the Japanese property-price decline was much more extreme, Koo highlighted. “I don’t think China will allow that kind of thing to happen.”

Former IMF chief economist Raghuram Rajan pointed out another difference with Japan, which went through a “full-fledged banking crisis” decades ago. Rajan, who has also served as India’s central bank governor, said on Bloomberg Television Wednesday that China has “a fairly strong administrative system which can put losses where they should be — where they can be easily absorbed.”

Still, moves by China’s corporate sector to begin reducing leverage from around 2016 are a particular concern, Koo said, given how Chinese industries remain “massively competitive.”

“The fact that companies — which should be borrowing and expanding — are not doing so suggests that entrepreneurs are worried,” he said. Uncertainty about government regulation and the legacy impact of panemic lockdowns on corporate balance sheets could explain that, according to Koo.

One of China’s top economic think tanks, the China Finance 40 Forum, looked at Koo’s concept in a report on “damaged balance sheets,” released Thursday. While stopping short of saying China faced such a recession, it did call for stronger fiscal policy and for the government and central bank to directly inject capital into the private sector, or purchase private-sector assets.

“China needs to carry out strong counter-cyclical adjustment, but also needs the imagination and creativity to adopt targeted policies in response to damaged balance sheets,” the report said.

Another vulnerability for China is that globalization is more established now than it was when Japan’s economy was at a similar stage — meaning Chinese entrepreneurs can more easily move their operations abroad.

In addition, China’s population has peaked earlier in the development stage than Japan’s did. Along with a relatively greater dependence on construction, this indicates “the challenge China faces is probably much larger than Japan’s were,” Koo said.

China has space to expand government borrowing so long as private-sector savings remain high, he argued. However, “debt is already large, and you have to expand it to offset all the deleveraging that is going to take place — that could put some pressure on the Chinese financial market.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/inventor-of-balance-sheet-recession-says-china-is-now-in-one""&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; - China is falling into a “balance-sheet recession” and needs to ramp up fiscal stimulus quickly to address the challenge, according to the economist who coined the phrase to explain Japan’s descent into stagnation in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

Author (Michael Smolyansky, Principal Economist of the Federal Reserve) says in the abstract:

&gt; I show that the decline in interest rates and corporate tax rates over the past three decades accounts
for the majority of the period’s exceptional stock market performance. Lower interest expenses
and corporate tax rates mechanically explain over 40 percent of the real growth in corporate profits
from 1989 to 2019. In addition, the decline in risk-free rates alone accounts for all of the expansion
in price-to-earnings multiples. I argue, however, that the boost to profits and valuations from ever declining interest and corporate tax rates is unlikely to continue, indicating significantly lower
profit growth and stock returns in the future. 

From Fig 1, interest and tax went from 50% of EBIT to maybe 25% today.

He concludes that EBIT is now constrained to increase at the economic growth rate of &lt;2% a year.     And that the equity risk premium was 7.2% rather than 3.6% between 1962 and 1989.    He contradicts Greenwald et al (2022), saying that it wasn't reallocation of profits from labor to capital that drove the high corporate profits growth.    And he says that his conclusions is pessimistic, because he doesn't take into account the feedback effect of  low taxes and interest on EBIT, just their fraction of it.   

Smolyansky claims (page 16) that 

&gt; an expansion in P/E multiples accounted for 33 percent of stock price growth for S&amp;P 500 nonfinancial firms ... that the decline in risk-free rates from 1989 to 2019 can explain the entirety of the expansion in P/E multiples.

In Table 1, it's a bit depressing that the 1962-1989 era was better in fundamentals like sales growth and GDP growth but worse for stock market performance, including real dividend growth and net income growth.    So a return to reality today would be anchored in worse fundamentals.

To conclude:

&gt; In the future, the real longer run growth rate of both stock prices and corporate earnings is
therefore unlikely to exceed 2 percent per year. Given that this represents an optimistic scenario,
the risks to this forecast, if anything, are to the downside. 

tl;dr - ouch.   And he's not even talking about cutting rates and raising taxes, just about keeping them flat.

If I naively assume that real returns, growth plus payouts, are 1/PE in the absence of an external driver (rate and tax cuts), then returns should be 1/25=4%; given around 2% dividends, then 1/PE-Dividends could be the 2% he's talking about.  But I'm not sure if I'm doing this right.

If this is all true, does it mean that existing mature companies that pay significant dividends are a better bet than investing in illusory growth?      Or at least, any solid company with a low PE is better, because 1/PE is all you'll get for a long time?     Maybe, because non-value companies are priced on the basis of (falsely) anticipated future growth.   But I suspect that if Smolyansky is right, there won't be any real refuges.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full PDF: &lt;a href=""https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2023041pap.pdf""&gt;https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2023041pap.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve increased my salary about 80% in the last 4 years due to a job change and I&amp;#39;m about to get married. Combined we&amp;#39;ll make around $270k annually and are both moving up in our fields steadily. I also have a rental property that I will keep until I&amp;#39;m retired and may even pass it down to our kid(s), which we are currently trying for. I also work for an ESOP, so I don&amp;#39;t know what the ramifications are there, tax-wise, but it will likely be close to as much as my 401k/Roth when I retire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its unlikely I&amp;#39;ll have to pull out any money for emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any opinions are much appreciated! TIA and GL to everyone&amp;#39;s investments&lt;/p&gt;

781,investing,"Hello,

  
I will soonly have a certain amount of money to invest. At first I was thinking to only invest in ETFs like cw8 for example, (very) long term only.

  
But recently I started to get a bit more ambitious… or greedy ? I know that on a 20-30 years span, with big ETF like cw8 I can reach yearly 5% on average, but I like the “science” around stocks, investment and so on, so I think it’s a good deal to give a bit of my time if I can reach more than 5%... and I’ll feel more in control too since I’d choose myself the stocks to pick, when to buy when to sell and so on…

  
So if I understood right I’d be more in a “position trading” strategy, since I'm still thinking long term. The way I imagine it is like, I cautiously pick a stock to buy, waiting for roughly 1 or 2 years, selling it and take profit. Ideal case I know. I was even considering to pay a premium subscription on websites like seekingalpha to get the best stocks recommandations but I’ve read on reddit that even with that kind of “high level content” this is to take with great caution.  

  
So, could you recommend me some kind of good websites, apps, or whatever to choose the right stocks ? I mean I don’t aim to become a billionaire, I wonder how greedy my text sounds, but “position trading” is a thing right ?

782,investing,"“The US banking system remains strong and resilient,” Vice Chair for Supervision Michael S. Barr [declared](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230628a.htm) following the receipt of stress test results for the nation's largest banks. Indeed, it's promising news. This month I've already examined some of the challenges faced by the banking sector, yet in the face of major stressors including a 10% unemployment rate and a steep drop in residential and commercial property values, the system is holding up. The test projected combined losses for the top 23 banks would be $541 billion, with Tier 1 declining between 2.3 and 10.1% percentage points.

Already we've seen an initial regulatory response, and as a result, banks now have clarity on their necessary capital reserves. More regulatory developments are on the horizon, as on the heels of the stress test, regulators will disclose new capital requirements under the Basel III Endgame. Back in early June, there were rumors that the Fed might raise capital requirements for large banks by 20% and reduce the asset threshold from 250 billion to 100 billion, so we’ll finally get to see what happens on that front.

The Fed also plans to overhaul its banking supervision rules. Powell explained this push by stating that banks tend overlook additional risks, citing as evidence the SVB collapse. He argued that the bank fell not due to credit risks, but as a consequence of ignoring interest rate risks and flaws in their business model.

In any event, it's clear that large banks will weather the storm - they're simply too big to fail. Recent stress tests, however, indicate that many might need to delay shareholder payouts, or at least to trim them down to size. In the past, when the Fed conducted stress tests, all major banks would publicize their shareholder return plans. This year is different, as the stakes are higher and more clarity is needed on the new policies. Still, Wall Street responded positively today with a rise in banking stocks.

What does this mean for regional banks?

Here the situation gets trickier. Most regional banks provide loans to real estate and retail sectors. As rates climb, loan volumes are gradually decreasing, threatening income and necessitating a decrease in deposits. Mortgage loans are also in decline. However, we can at least sleep soundly about residential real estate, as recent stats paint a relatively positive picture.

Commercial real estate could still pose a problem though. With remote work due to COVID-19 becoming the norm, office spaces sit unused—not a great situation for landlords, nor for the banks that financed their investments. According to Green Street, average office costs have decreased by 27%. It's worth noting that by 2025, about $1.5 trillion of commercial real estate debt is due for repayment, and several regional banks are already actively cutting back on commercial real estate investments and are instead offloading assets.

Moreover, loan delinquencies are rising. In May, over 4% of securitized commercial real estate loans were more than 30 days overdue, the highest mark since 2018.

I'm not insinuating anything, but these facts do raise some eyebrows.

In conclusion, yes, the U.S. banking system is strong and prepared for a storm. The proverbial black swans have turned grey, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. In order to avoid a crisis, further proactive measures will need to be taken, and it seems that regulators are doing just that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The US banking system remains strong and resilient,” Vice Chair for Supervision Michael S.

789,investing,"**Here are 10 investing lessons from Warren Buffett:**

**1. What you own**  
What and how you invest matters.  
Buffett focuses on businesses with great management and economic advantages.  
The key word is business.  
Buffett isn’t a stock picker.  
He calls himself a business picker.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Diversification**  
Just because you’re diversified doesn’t mean you have less risk.  
And just because you have a concentrated position doesn’t mean you have more risk.  
Concentrating on a few stocks can decrease your risk if it means you’ll pay more attention to the business.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Market pricing**  
Buffett says a stock price shouldn’t determine whether you buy or sell.  
In the short term, people vote with their dollars on which stocks will do well.  
In the long term, stocks with the most value tend to do well.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Be greedy when others are fearful**  
When money is cheap, hold on to it.  
When money is expensive, invest it.  
Every so often doom and gloom will hit the stock market.  
This is your chance to run towards it with wads of cash.  
Instead of running away with pennies on the dollar.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Buy businesses that reinvest in themselves**  
If it’s a great company, with great management, and great profits…  
Why wouldn’t they reinvest in themselves?  
This creates an element of compound interest.  
Except instead of your returns compounding, it’s business operations.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Prioritize moat**  
If a business model produces high profits, there will be competition.  
Businesses that thrive like this have one thing in common:  
A moat.  
A moat doesn’t only keep them profitable, but it keeps them in competition long term.  
This is crucial for investors.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Buy boring businesses**  
Especially if they sell products/services people need.  
Boring businesses provide stability and longevity to your portfolio.  
This allows you to make money for longer periods of time.

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Invest like a sloth**  
“For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motions increase.”  
Most investors would make more money if they bought and held instead of buying and trading.  
This applies to rebalancing too.  
Here’s what I mean…

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Rebalancing your portfolio**  
Most people trim a position once it gets large.  
Buffett does the opposite.  
Selling positions that have become too big is the same as the bulls trading Michael Jordan because he’s become too good.  
Don’t sell your winners.  
Let them run.

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Time and business**  
Time is a friend of great businesses but an enemy of the mediocre.  
Just because a company does well short term doesn’t mean it’s sustainable.  
“When the tide goes out, you’ll see who’s been swimming naked.”

Hello Redditors,  
I am a late twenty-something currently living with my parents, not because I am dependent but because they are elderly and require my presence. They've done so much for me, and I enjoy spending time with them. My living arrangement has significantly reduced my expenditure as I don't have to pay for rent or groceries, and only have some minor travel costs.  
I have a job that pays fairly well and I'm planning to work for one more year before I transition to grad school. In the context of these circumstances, I am looking for advice on how I can best invest my money to generate a profit.  
For context, my skillset includes public speaking, foreign language proficiency, and understanding of natural science subjects. I consider myself intellectually adaptable, meaning I am open to learning new skills that may help my financial growth.  
Here's what I would like your advice on:  
   
1. What kind of investments should I be considering, given that I will be leaving my job for grad school (medical school) in a year?  
2. Are there any skills that you believe are in high demand that I could potentially learn to increase my earning potential?  
3. Any other advice or resources you recommend for someone in my position?

I have about 100k in a 457b account. I am leaving my government employer, going to law school for 3 years, and starting a second career. I am about 35 years old. I am fortunate enough to be able to live off of savings during this 3 year period, and I don’t foresee needing to use this 457b money anytime in the immediate future. 


As my income will drop significantly during the 3 year hiatus from employment, should I take advantage of this and clean out my 457b account, pay income tax on it while in a low bracket, and move it to a post tax investment account (VTI)? Or should I leave it in the 457b and not withdraw until I have retired from my second career in 20-30 years?

This is likely a temporary gig. When it's done, am I able to roll all of these over into my 401(k) or Roth IRA? If so, would it affect the annual maximum contribution limit for either? I'm guessing no on the latter question but wanted to make sure there's nothing I'm overlooking.

**Outlook:**

Concentrix is acquiring Webhelp (private) and becoming the biggest CX provider. They are neck in neck with Teleperformance who acquired Majorel for 1.5 times sales to Enterprise Value - means they all feel prices are low enough for consolidation in the industry.

Looking at the first table it looks like Concentrix is undervalued by 40% on already depressed numbers of EV/Revenue as average EV/Revenue for Teleperformance has been more like 2 historically. So prices will be expected to reach $120 on just 1 times EV/Revenue.

But lets say if we give it a more reasonable number of 1.5-2 EV/Revenue then stock price will be expected to reach $160.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me know if this looks good and any comments/upvotes will be appreciated.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrix is acquiring Webhelp (private) and becoming the biggest CX provider. They are neck in neck with Teleperformance who acquired Majorel for 1.5 times sales to Enterprise Value - means they all feel prices are low enough for consolidation in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the first table it looks like Concentrix is undervalued by 40% on already depressed numbers of EV/Revenue as average EV/Revenue for Teleperformance has been more like 2 historically. So prices will be expected to reach $120 on just 1 times EV/Revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But lets say if we give it a more reasonable number of 1.5-2 EV/Revenue then stock price will be expected to reach $160.&lt;/p&gt;

The timing was rough, everything went down, big time, and I still haven't fully recovered (-6%).

My only goal was to match the performance of my 401k which did extremely well for the decade prior. 

Now when I look at my portfolio, I'm wondering, which of these are my big losers and which are my keepers? What is my new objective because hoping for 10% gains over time is probably not good enough of a goal? When should I sell off low performers?

But I'm also thinking - how should I track my own performance and decision making? I don't even remember why or when I invested into each of these ETFs.

100K- I bought a house. This number includes my down payment and renovations and the addition of an ADU I will be living in. I will be renting out the main house and living rent free or almost rent free. This house is in an up and coming area, and an ADU is a very secure value adding renovation. 

75K- put into my investing account that already has money in it investing in long term stocks 

100K- in a money market account for even lower risk lower gain. This is a temporary measure until I have secured tenants and cash flow in my house. I just didn’t want to risk a drop in the next year when I may need it emergently. This money is where my main question comes in 

15K- for funzies

My questions are as follows: what do y’all think of my breakdown, and what is something a little higher risk higher reward I should look into for my 100K once I establish cash flow from the house. I’m young, this money fell into my lap, while I want to be smart and set myself up for success I also think this is the time to take some leaps of faith.

I'm invested exclusivly into the US stock market but my native currency is the CHF.

I want to hedge my exposure to the USD vs the CHF via the CME Micro USD/CHF (M6S) futures with a notional value of 10'000 USD.

My broker is IBRK and they will happily let me trade this product. Now I'm familiar with the mechanics of futures and IBRK wants me to put up about 1000$ in margin per short future.

We can assume I have 10'000 USD in US Stocks/ETFs and I sell one USD/CHF Micro Future short with 2000$ in cash in my account.

Would some of you shed some light on the following questions?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Have I now fixed my exchange rate to the USD and am now immune to the fluctuations of the USD vs the CHF?
2. Can I always roll the contract to the following front month only adding the profit/loss of the previous expiration?
3. The contract M6S seems to be rather illiquid. What are the typical spreads on such contracts?
4. What risk am I adding to my portfolio? Technicly speaking I have 10'000 USD in the form of equities but they can decline vs. the CHF for other reasons than the USDCHF exchange rate and I'm still on the hook for that futures contract. What are the added risks as a retail investor by using such rather complex (and often dangerous) instruments for hedging in this case?
5. Should I even bother?

3 Low-Priced REITs Making Big Moves
Mentioned:	BDN CIO DHC HPP UNIT
Several low-priced real estate investment trusts (REITs) made huge moves higher this week, and many are in the office or healthcare subsectors.

Investors know that low-priced stocks can be volatile, and it's as easy to lose as it is to gain a lot in the short term. These stocks are not for conservative investors or for people on a fixed income who cannot afford to take large risks with their capital.

But abrupt new moves in a low-priced stock often portend even more future gains to come. If an investor is patient and perhaps waits for a price pullback off a spike, it is possible to do quite well on these trades.

Take a look at three low-priced REITs that have blasted higher on increasing volume this week.

Don't miss: The Company That Built Elon Musk's Tiny Home Is Partnering With This REIT To Solve The Affordable Housing Crisis And Provide A Unique Investment Opportunity

Diversified Healthcare Trust (NASDAQ: DHC) is a Newton, Massachusetts-based healthcare REIT that owns 376 healthcare-related properties of approximately $7.1 billion across 36 states and Washington, D.C. In addition to over 100 life science and medical offices, Diversified Healthcare Trust also has 27,389 senior living community units in its portfolio.

In April, Office Properties Income Trust (NASDAQ: OPI) announced it was acquiring Diversified Healthcare Trust in an all-share transaction. It seemed like a done deal because in May, Office Properties Income Trust began to implement the financing needed to complete the transaction.

On June 2, Diversified Healthcare Director Adam D. Portnoy purchased a total of 5,566,644 shares at an average price of $1.77 per share, for a total of $9.81 million.

However, on June 5, investment adviser firm Flat Footed LLC, a top shareholder with about 8% of Diversified Healthcare Trust, reiterated its intent to vote against the proposed merger. Flat Footed sent a letter to the Diversified Healthcare board asking for clarification of details of the merger â specifically why the board is willing to let Diversified Healthcare go for $1.13 per share after rejecting an all-cash $4 per share bid in 2022. The letter also asked why Portnoy was purchasing Diversified Healthcare stock at $1.77, well above the merger price.

Diversified Healthcare shares rose quickly after this was announced and are up 37.28% over the past three days. Its most recent closing price was $2.32.

Uniti Group Inc. (NASDAQ: UNIT) is a Little Rock, Arkansas-based specialty REIT that acquires and constructs mission-critical communications infrastructure in the form of fiber optics, copper and coaxial broadband networks.

Uniti Group owns and operates 137,000 fiber route miles covering 275,000 commercial buildings, with most of its network in the Eastern and Midwestern portions of the U.S. It's one of the 10 largest fiber providers in the U.S. today, and its fiber optic leasing generates about 70% of its total revenue.

Analysts have been tepid on Uniti Group recently. Morgan Stanley analyst Simon Flannery maintained an Underweight rating on Uniti Group on June 1, while lowering the price target from $7 to $6. On May 30, RBC Capital Markets analyst Bora Lee maintained a Sector Perform rating on Uniti Group but lowered the price target from $7 to $5.

But over three days this week, and without any news, Uniti Group has risen 11.86%. On Tuesday, it was 6.3% higher in the premarket and finished up 4.4% for the day. Its most recent closing price was $4.34.

Unity Group President and CEO Kenny Gunderman purchased 225,000 shares of Uniti Group at an average price of $4.37 in the first week of March, amounting to $983,250.

Perhaps investors are feeling more confident that the $0.15 per share quarterly dividend, or $0.60 annual per share that yields 13.82%, will remain intact. The next ex-dividend date is June 15.

City Office REIT Inc. (NYSE: CIO) is a Dallas-based office REIT that owns 58 buildings totaling 6 million square feet. The REIT is focused on the Sun Belt region, West Coast and select areas in Florida.

On May 30, RBC Capital analyst Michael Carroll maintained a Sector Perform rating on City Office REIT but was more negative in lowering the price target from $10 to $7.

Nevertheless, City Office REIT is one of several office REITs that have seen huge price increases this week in a subsector that has had very little love from Wall Street for a long time. City Office REIT is up 9.7% this week.

Other low-priced office REITs picking up big gains this week are Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE: BDN), up 10.71%, and Hudson Pacific Properties Inc. (NYSE: HPP), up 9.66% in three days. Office stocks were crushed between February and the end of May but have shown recent resiliency.

862,investing,"(Please note that while I have been investing for a while, it has been mostly according to standard strategy/buying broad-market index funds and planning to hold until retirement. Thus I'm not particularly well versed in terminology, concepts etc, so forgive me if any common misconceptions or novice-level misunderstandings are to blame for my confusion here)  

If I want to make a bet that the US economy will continue to grow from now until my investment horizon (and that this will be generally priced accurately by the market) I can choose from a dozen different index funds that track the US economy in various ways. If I want to make a similar bet that the world economy will continue to grow, there are plenty of options that do something similar but for the international economy.

However, say I want to make a bet that a specific foreign country's economy will grow from now until my investment horizon. Say, for example, Botswana. In theory, assuming that the stock performance of companies from a given country is tied to the growth of that country's economy, over a long enough period during which the Botswanan economy grows faster than the US economy an investment into a hypothetical ETF that tracked the Botswanan economy could have a higher yield than a US broad-market index fund.

So, say I want to make a bet on Botswana's growth. Why does it seem so hard to do this? For starters, I've done a little research, and it doesn't even seem like there *are* any ETFs that attempt to be based on the Botswanan economy at all, let alone any that attempt to track the Botswanan stock market specifically. On etfdb.com, only five ETFs which are based around exposure to African economies are listed at all! Two are South African economy index funds, one's an Egyptian economy index fund, one's a Nigerian economy index fund, and one's a general African economy ETF.

There are 36 companies listed on the Botswanan Stock Exchange. Is it just the case that this isn't a sufficient number of companies for there to exist an ETF that attempts to track the Botswanan economy by investing in Botswanan publicly-traded companies? 

The question as to why the economies of so many nations seem to be unnecessarily difficult to access as a US retail investor isn't the entire scope of my problem, either. As mentioned, some other specific foreign national economies are tracked by ETFs. However, it doesn't seem like these funds really... do what they're supposed to, if that makes sense. For example, here is my back of the napkin math: Over the last ten years or so, the US GDP has grown by a factor of about 1.6, from about 16 trillion dollars to about 26 trillion. Over the same time period, the price of SPY has grown by a factor of 2.7. Now, compare the ratio between US GDP growth:SPY yield to the ratio between Indian GDP growth:INDA yield over the same time period (INDA, which is MSCI's India ETF, being by far the largest Indian-economy-tracking ETF). Over the last ten years, the Indian GDP has grown by about a factor of 2, from 1.85 trillion dollars to 3.7 trillion dollars. However, the price of INDA has only grown by a factor of about 1.7 over this time period. Despite the Indian economy growing more rapidly than the American economy, ETFs that track the Indian economy performed vastly worse than ETFs that track the American economy - and not only that, but ETFs that track the Indian economy perform worse than the Indian economy, itself. 

A similar pattern seems to hold true for plenty of other foreign countries, even those with very optimistic economic futures like India's: whereas the value of US stock market index funds grow at a rate higher than the growth rate of the national economy, the value of ETFs tracking the economies of foreign nations grow at a rate much slower than the the growth rate of those countries' economies... if they even grow at all! As another example, the economy of the Philippines has done great over the last 10 years, growing by a factor of about 1.5. They have had a yearly growth rate of about 6 percent over the last few years, which the IMF expects to continue into 2024. Despite this, the iShares MSCI Philippines ETF, EHPE, has only steadily *lost* value over the same time period of the last ten years, depreciating by a factor of 0.7! 

I could understand if this was the case for, say, China, or Vietnam. There are other considerations to make with investments in these countries, such as the tenuous relationship with the US, potential meddling by the state in the economy, etc, all of which have gone on for at least ten years and so could account for a net loss in any ETFs tracking their economy due to justified fear, uncertainty, and doubt. But what can account for the situation of the Philippines, for example, where an investment made 10 years ago would today be worth 70% of its original cost, despite the economy growing by roughly 50 percent during the same time period? Again, this seems to be a common situation across many of the foreign investment options available to US retail investors. And of course, this is assuming that some semblance of an option even exists in the first place, which isn't the case for many countries that otherwise seem to have economies large/optimistic enough to be seemingly attractive investments.

What's the explanation for this? And are there any solutions? Most of the resources I found online simply advised people to invest in generalized international ETFs, if they wanted their portfolio to have exposure to e.g. Botswana. But if I wanted to more directedly invest in foreign countries that don't have specific ETFs tracking their economy, or if I wanted to invest in e.g. the Philippines without buying an ETF that only seems to lose value despite the steady growth of the fundamentals it is supposed to track, would there be any way to do so?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Please note that while I have been investing for a while, it has been mostly according to standard strategy/buying broad-market index funds and planning to hold until retirement. Thus I&amp;#39;m not particularly well versed in terminology, concepts etc, so forgive me if any common misconceptions or novice-level misunderstandings are to blame for my confusion here)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I want to make a bet that the US economy will continue to grow from now until my investment horizon (and that this will be generally priced accurately by the market) I can choose from a dozen different index funds that track the US economy in various ways. If I want to make a similar bet that the world economy will continue to grow, there are plenty of options that do something similar but for the international economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, say I want to make a bet that a specific foreign country&amp;#39;s economy will grow from now until my investment horizon. Say, for example, Botswana. In theory, assuming that the stock performance of companies from a given country is tied to the growth of that country&amp;#39;s economy, over a long enough period during which the Botswanan economy grows faster than the US economy an investment into a hypothetical ETF that tracked the Botswanan economy could have a higher yield than a US broad-market index fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, say I want to make a bet on Botswana&amp;#39;s growth. Why does it seem so hard to do this? For starters, I&amp;#39;ve done a little research, and it doesn&amp;#39;t even seem like there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; any ETFs that attempt to be based on the Botswanan economy at all, let alone any that attempt to track the Botswanan stock market specifically. On etfdb.com, only five ETFs which are based around exposure to African economies are listed at all! Two are South African economy index funds, one&amp;#39;s an Egyptian economy index fund, one&amp;#39;s a Nigerian economy index fund, and one&amp;#39;s a general African economy ETF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 36 companies listed on the Botswanan Stock Exchange. Is it just the case that this isn&amp;#39;t a sufficient number of companies for there to exist an ETF that attempts to track the Botswanan economy by investing in Botswanan publicly-traded companies? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question as to why the economies of so many nations seem to be unnecessarily difficult to access as a US retail investor isn&amp;#39;t the entire scope of my problem, either. As mentioned, some other specific foreign national economies are tracked by ETFs. However, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like these funds really... do what they&amp;#39;re supposed to, if that makes sense. For example, here is my back of the napkin math: Over the last ten years or so, the US GDP has grown by a factor of about 1.6, from about 16 trillion dollars to about 26 trillion. Over the same time period, the price of SPY has grown by a factor of 2.7. Now, compare the ratio between US GDP growth:SPY yield to the ratio between Indian GDP growth:INDA yield over the same time period (INDA, which is MSCI&amp;#39;s India ETF, being by far the largest Indian-economy-tracking ETF). Over the last ten years, the Indian GDP has grown by about a factor of 2, from 1.85 trillion dollars to 3.7 trillion dollars. However, the price of INDA has only grown by a factor of about 1.7 over this time period. Despite the Indian economy growing more rapidly than the American economy, ETFs that track the Indian economy performed vastly worse than ETFs that track the American economy - and not only that, but ETFs that track the Indian economy perform worse than the Indian economy, itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern seems to hold true for plenty of other foreign countries, even those with very optimistic economic futures like India&amp;#39;s: whereas the value of US stock market index funds grow at a rate higher than the growth rate of the national economy, the value of ETFs tracking the economies of foreign nations grow at a rate much slower than the the growth rate of those countries&amp;#39; economies... if they even grow at all! As another example, the economy of the Philippines has done great over the last 10 years, growing by a factor of about 1.5. They have had a yearly growth rate of about 6 percent over the last few years, which the IMF expects to continue into 2024. Despite this, the iShares MSCI Philippines ETF, EHPE, has only steadily &lt;em&gt;lost&lt;/em&gt; value over the same time period of the last ten years, depreciating by a factor of 0.7! &lt;/p&gt;

Their UI has historically been crap and they’ve definitely been making strides to improve it, but just last night I noticed my returns 4x’ed from $2,900ish up to $13,000ish. 

I was pretty excited to say the least and thought it had to be a glitch on mobile, I logged into desktop and it was still the same. This morning I woke up to it being $3,000ish.

So what happened is some novice developer pushed broken code up for half a day straight into production. 

I work for big tech and get slip ups can happen, but when it comes to financial calculations and around peoples money you need checks and balances to make sure you don’t do this. More than they have now.

Which alternative brokerage would you recommend for a clean UI, good data visualization, and mostly low cost index investing?

New to the investment world as I just graduated college and am beginning my full-time job in August. Looking to open a Roth IRA either with my parent's Edward Jones Advisor or with a broker. If I go with independent, with a broker, I plan on investing in commonly recommended indexes, so not an aggressive strategy.

**Question**

Common advice is to be more aggressive with investments when you are young as you have more time to let them ride. I'm worried that I am going to regret being passive with my investments if I choose to open my own Roth IRA with an online broker. Would an Edward Jones advisor create a more aggressive portfolio or am I concerned about nothing?

To set the picture, my job and my spouses have plans that are guaranteed but you can only put aside so much. 

We then discovered IRA and max it.

My kids have 529s.

Over the last 3 years I was in crypto but also started single stock investing. 

I have built a portfolio over the last 2 years of about 34k in higher dividend stocks. No less than 6% up to 14% with a mix of about 9.5% of current value.

Now some pay monthly but most quarterly. 

So the last several years have been nuts. My IRA that I have maxed for several years has seen a total return, through vanguard, of 8.6% over the last 6 years due to the ups and downs. 

Dividend stocks also go up and down but they pay you. So good example is I have a stock that I purchase $10 a day. Currently it sits at just at 10% if dividends continue. This stock I am up .02% today but it has paid me 11.3% in dividends which I used to buy other stocks and more of this stock. 

I have that money, it’s mine. It’s working. Where as “growth” doesn’t actually compound. At the end of 2021 my IRA was up over 16k it’s now only up about 8.7k. So that money has actually done nothing for me over the last 2 years. I’ve actually just lost money and due to inflation it’s worth even less. 

My buddy said dump in VOO which I have and my Ira is a similar product from vanguard. That’s my point though, the dividends pay me now. So I can reinvest it and I’m actually gaining. If I plan to hold 15 years I just care they keep paying dividends not what the price is day to day.

Hi all, 

I am figuring my way around Schwab and Fidelity. My main goal is to invest in the S&amp;P 500, with interested in individual shares down the line. 

I’m hearing that you can buy fractional shares with Fidelity but not with Schwab. Is this true for any and all shares? Does this include S&amp;P 500 as well? 

If for instance I wanted to put $200 towards the S&amp;P 500, is it correct to assume I can do that with Fidelity and not with Schwab?

So I have been experimenting with investing and deciding on what investment strategy works best for me for the past 2 years. I have decided to go with the safe ETF route. I want to end up with a portfolio of 3 ETF's with a diversification off 60% S&amp;P, 30% Stockx 600 en 10% EM. I decided against 1 whole world ETF so I have the freedom to adjust the percentages whenever I feel like. Not planning to do that often or ever but I like having the option.

Now I sold my stocks but I do still have a decent chunk (around 20%) in the whole world ETF VWRL. My question is, do I sell so I can actually follow my strategy to the tee, or do I just keep it and let it dilute by consistently buying the other ETFs?

I for some reason am having trouble wrapping my mind around a Municipal Money Fund... I've read quite a bit about it so I understand the concept but struggle with the actual usage of it.

I have an account with Schwab and was looking specifically at the SWTXX Schwab Municipal Money Fund. If I were to put $10,000 into it how would that work? Every month I would get ""interest"" that is tax free? What happens if I were to take the money out after a couple of months? Is the gain taxed? Is this even a good place to park left over cash that is not invested that I want to be somewhat liquid?

I buy 1 share of 1 stock for $100. One month later, the stock drops to $90. Then, another month later, the price rises to $95. I then sell the share at $95 dollars.

I am 18 years old with no income. Therefore, I am not subject to a long term capital gains tax if I only gain $100 dollars before I sell a stock. At 18, I buy 1 share of a stock for $100. I hold the stock until I turn 22, and the share is now worth $200. I am not subject to a long term capital gains tax because I have no earned income during this time.

The goal is to have something with a long term strategy of buy&amp;hold in mind and use bonds to reduce a bit my risk/volatilty. I know the % of my portfolio may be too low to make a drastic impact but I can rebalance if necessary (either now and slowly over the years).

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m from EU and I am looking at investing a decent sum of money i recently got. My plan is roughly :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50% in an ETF World&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10% in an ETF real estate (global REITS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15 % in cash (saving accounts between 3-4% in my country, money easily accessible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15 % in crypto (a bit too much but that was already there...one day i&amp;#39;ll rebalance!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10% bonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m unsure about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pick a global index or something US-based ?&lt;/li&gt;

908,investing,"\~30yrs old, plan to retire at around 70. Trying to set up my 403b account with employer and plan on doing the following for a 90/10 stock/bond split.

VIIIX - 80% for domestic exposure (other options include VFTAX)

VTSNX - 10% for int'l exposure (no other options)

VBTIX - 10% for bonds (other options include VMFXX and FTKFX)

I have 3 general questions

1. Does this seem like a reasonable split to achieve the 90/10 split? 
2. I read somewhere that VIIIX doesn't get complete domestic exposure, but the only other indexes/funds I can invest in are VFTAX, VIEIX, and VSIAX. From what I'm reading about the funds, I would be essentially double dipping along with VIIIX correct?
3. I have a HYSA that offers 4% kept for emergency funds. Do people generally count this as a part of their investment portfolio? For example if I have 20k in my HYSA, 70k stocks, 10k bonds, would this be a 70/30 split (with HYSA) or a 87.5/12.5 split (without HSYA)?

This is something I've been thinking about ever since I started investing. I have tried googling it, but haven't found any article tackling the question. The PE ratio reflects how much investors are willing to pay for a company's earnings. Over time money supply increases and at the same time more and more people are taking interest in investing - and especially in the stock market. The digital world and the new simplicity of investing in stocks are making the stock market more and more widely available to everyone, and the more people are getting in, the more you will have to pay for what you're purchasing.

What I mean by that is that no matter how much money enters the market, companies will not earn more because of it. So if money is being printed and new people are coming into the market, you have to be willing to pay more to get the same stock as before.
