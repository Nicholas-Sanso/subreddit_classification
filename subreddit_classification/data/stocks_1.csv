# [Stock futures fall after U.S. downgrade spurs a sell-off, traders scrutinize latest earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.
*****
&gt; Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.
*****
&gt; “Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”
*****
&gt; In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.&lt;/p&gt;

I am 33M.  

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.  

I started getting more serious and doing a lot more research in the last year or so and have accepted my losses and sold off my bad investments.  I've now invested in a mix of growth/ETFs like VOO, SCHD, AAPL, and TSLA

I have two others in SPYD (don't ask why) and AUTL (hoping they get acquired) but not a significant amount in either. The rest of the money I just keep as SPAXX in Fidelity 

Lately, I just feel like the ""safest"" and more guaranteed return on investments are CDs and T-Bills given the interest rates they are offering (5% - 5.5%). I am in the process of setting up a CD/T-Bills ladder where I'd have maturing CDs or T-Bills monthly starting later this year. 

Should I continue with this approach? I know the interest rates will fluctuate and may not always be high but I haven't seen any of my investments besides TSLA really take off (AAPL has done decent). As noted above, I actually lost a good amount in the past.  

Right now, my goal is to not think about it everyday and just have my money grow over time (I will not need the cash). Should I just put it all in VOO? Leave it in SPAXX? Or just continue the ladder strategy? Are there any risks I'm not considering?

Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA on Tuesday, pointing to “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,” as well as a growing general debt burden.

Back in May, the agency placed the nation’s AAA rating on negative watch, blaming the debt ceiling fight. At the time, lawmakers in Washington butted heads over an agreement that would keep the federal government from running out of money. President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill on June 2, just days away from the “X-date” on June 5.

The country’s recent debt limit feud was mentioned again in the downgrade.

“In Fitch’s view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025,” the ratings agency said.

“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” Fitch said.

The agency also highlighted the rising general government deficit, which it anticipates will rise to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. “Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending (15% of total federal spending) as agreed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act offer only a modest improvement to the medium-term fiscal outlook,” Fitch said.

The agency also noted that a combination of tightening credit conditions, weakening business investment and a slowdown in consumption could lead the economy into a “mild” recession in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of next year.

This isn’t the first time a rating agency has downgraded the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2011 after Washington managed to avoid a default. At the time, the agency highlighted political risk as part of its reasoning.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency also highlighted the rising general government deficit, which it anticipates will rise to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. “Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending (15% of total federal spending) as agreed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act offer only a modest improvement to the medium-term fiscal outlook,” Fitch said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency also noted that a combination of tightening credit conditions, weakening business investment and a slowdown in consumption could lead the economy into a “mild” recession in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time a rating agency has downgraded the U.S. Standard &amp;amp; Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2011 after Washington managed to avoid a default. At the time, the agency highlighted political risk as part of its reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

As the tech giant prepares to release its earnings report, analysts emphasise the significance of revealing its utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost growth.

Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv.
Specifically, iPhone sales are anticipated to have declined by over 2% during this period, based on a survey of 24 analysts conducted by Visible Alpha. This contrasts with a nearly 3% increase in sales during the same quarter last year and a 1.5% rise in the preceding quarter (January-March).

The upcoming quarterly report may serve as a deviation from the positive earnings trend observed in other prominent tech companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Microsoft. These companies have demonstrated resilience in their cloud-based operations and have witnessed a surge in digital ad sales.

# [Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”
*****
&gt; A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.
*****
&gt; “I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.
*****
&gt; CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Wednesday, August 2nd, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Wednesday, August the 2nd, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.&lt;/p&gt;

This significant expansion demonstrates BKNG's capacity to increase its market presence and successfully seize commercial opportunities over time.  
BKNG's growth prospects are still bright; during the next five years, double-digit earnings growth is anticipated in all but one year. The corporation is anticipated to keep growing its revenues and operating well in the years to come, according to this optimistic prognosis. Going forward, BKNG's connected journey strategy will be one of the primary growth drivers. This approach is based on personalising the travel experience for each consumer utilising data and technology. According to each person's interests, hotels and activities are suggested, and travel schedules are updated in real time.  
There are some risks involved with investing in BKNG because of their business style. Being a business that focuses on travel, BKNG's success is closely correlated with that of the travel sector. Travel spending may decline during economic downturns, which could have an effect on BKNG's operations. While I still believe in the travel sector's long-term promise, I also recognise that it is vulnerable to unanticipated occurrences like the COVID-19 pandemic, which might once again cause travel to be disrupted.  
Despite these dangers, a number of factors are driving future expansion. Since a few years ago, BKNG has made significant investments in AI technology, further demonstrating their dedication to provide consumers with trips that are more connected and personalised. By using AI to analyse information in several languages and provide personalised recommendations, BKNG hopes to improve relationships with customers and partners.   
While other BKNG brands are working to incorporate this technology into their own offers, others, like KAYAK and OpenTable, are actively experimenting with generative AI plug-ins. BKNG is well-positioned to create an engaging and distinctive booking experience, customised to match the various demands of its consumers, thanks to a solid AI base. By utilising AI, I think BKNG will continue to lead the travel sector, constantly enhancing its offerings to give clients the greatest experience possible while encouraging long-term, significant shareholder development.

&lt;p&gt;The projected $4.5 billion loss is over twice as much as Model e&amp;#39;s $2.1 billion loss in 2022. The company recently announced that the price of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks will be reduced due to cheaper raw battery materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company touted that its low EV prices &amp;quot;establish[es] leadership ahead of industry’s next-generation EVs&amp;quot; and that the Ford Model e&amp;#39;s revenue is up 39%. Ford is also expected to produce 600,000 EVs per year by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks with Tesla Inc., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and other automakers about supplying them with lithium as the oil giant works to build a business around the crucial battery metal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Exxon is one of several oil and gas companies seeking to expand into lithium production to take advantage of surging demand for use in electric-vehicle batteries, and as a way of diversifying beyond fossil fuels. The talks with potential customers are still early stage, and the company has yet to lay out its plans for potential lithium operations. However, the discussions are the latest sign of Exxon’s growing interest in the lithium business.

The company has also had conversations with battery giants Samsung and SK On Co., the people said, asking not to be named because the information is private. Exxon, SK On and Volkswagen declined to comment. Tesla, Ford and Samsung didn’t reply to messages seeking comment.

The rapid global roll out of electric vehicles has raised the risk of bottlenecks and shortages for key battery materials like lithium, sparking a rush to invest in and secure supply.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.
[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html""&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broadening of the market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl&amp;#39;s (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (&lt;sup&gt;DJI).&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven&amp;#39;t mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street’s busiest earnings week continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.
*****
&gt; Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.
*****
&gt; More than 160 S&amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.
*****
&gt; To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.
*****
&gt; “We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”
*****
&gt; He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.
*****
&gt; “As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.
*****
&gt; Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.

[This website lists the YTD price performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance), so not including dividends.

Number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 over ___ YTD:

- 20% YTD: 128
- 30% YTD: 75
- 40% YTD: 47
- 50% YTD: 27
- 60% YTD: 15

About 172 stocks have a possibly negative YTD price return (again, excluding dividends). 328 are positive YTD.

Upshot: No, this is not a rally being driven by 7 stocks anymore. All sectors are starting to catch a bid, especially ones beaten down in 2023 like energy and financials. Even as Europe and China teeter on recession, we're seeing international stocks also rally.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still think this is an &amp;#39;isolated&amp;#39;, low-breadth rally?&lt;/p&gt;

Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by $2.7 billion, up 26% during the second quarter to $12.7 billion at quarterend, and over 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are from direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the second quarter, the median FICO score was 747. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans. Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty.

62,stocks,"I was wondering if anyone is holding NTDOF and wanted to post info about the dividend yield and ADR Fees?  I was sort of curious is it better long term to hold NTDOY and NDTOF and find it hard to compare the ""cost structure"".

I had a few shares of NTDOY recently on a dividend payout with this cost structure info

1 share NTDOY (currently trades $11.28) is 1/4th of Nintendo 7974.T stock  
Dividend declared 123 yen/share or 30.75 yen/NTDOY   
Dividend received in US account on July 11th when yen to dollar was 140.27yen/dollar  
Dividend I received of $0.214 per NTDOY after-foreign taxes withheld and conversion to the dollar  
This means 0.214 was received when the conversion would be 0.219 so approx -3% to taxes  
ADR maintenance fee charged after the dividend of $0.0299 / share meaning $0.1841 received  


Final net of 0.1841/share on estimated 0.219 payout is 84% efficiency or in other words -16% of the dividend payout goes to foreign taxes and also ADR fees before US taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a similar experience seeing about 16% of the yield value go out the door to ADR?  While I like NTDOY, I was curious if NTDOF has a lower fee in the end, was wondering if anyone is holding it and wants to look at it and compare? 

The ADRS trade at the same relative price adjusting for share % but in my view if one has significantly lower fees it would be a better buy.

65,stocks,"Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.

More than 1 million Netflix accounts and around 800,000 Disney+ subscribers in the U.S. are on ad-supported tiers, according to Ampere, representing nearly 2% of each service’s total subscriber base. The firm estimates that more than 90% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad-supported tier, representing around 45 million subscriptions.

Prior to the launch of Max, Discovery+ had somewhere in the region of 10 million ad-supported accounts, while HBO Max had around 2 million, Ampere said. It added that Peacock has more than 30 million ad-supported subscribers, the most of any new U.S. OTT service, while Paramount+ has more than 25 million ad-supported subscribers in the U.S.

Ampere believes that hybrid services are “an increasingly important element of streaming service monetization, and hybrid tiers often generate more revenue per subscription than their ad-free counterparts.” It also says that the tiers “represent a way for consumers to maintain a wider array of subscriptions while economic times remain tough.”

Ampere’s latest research comes as earnings season for the major studios is in full swing.

Netflix, which recently eliminated its basic ad-free plan in the United States as it expands its password sharing crackdown, added 5.9 million paid subscribers during the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 238.4 million globally. During its upfront presentation to advertisers in May, Netflix reported that the ad tier had nearly 5 million monthly active users.

Meanwhile, NBCUniversal parent Comcast reported that Peacock had a total of 24 million paid subscribers. The streaming service, which dropped its free tier for new users in January, recently said it would bump up the price for its Premium and Premium Plus tiers to $5.99 and $11.99, respectively, which will take effect on Aug. 17. Due to certain streaming rights and contracts with content providers, some Peacock content still has ads.

Next up on the earnings docket will be Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its Max rebrand on May 23 — which offers a $9.99 per month Max Ad Lite tier, $15.99 per month Max Ad Free tier and $19.99 per month Max Ultimate Ad Free tier.

Meanwhile, Paramount Global, which charges $5.99 per month for its ad-supported option, and Disney, which launched its $7.99 per month ad-supported Disney+ tier in November, will report earnings on Aug. 7 and 9, respectively.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand raising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, encourages savings and makes lending harder, hence discouraging inflation. Cool


But they keep saying that should also make unemployment go up. This part I don't get; if it is costlier to live because of inflation, people will come to work and unemployment stays down. For unemployment to go up, I would assume ( based on these general logics ) that once inflation cools, the unemployment rate may increase as people who have saved up enough can be unemployed, or whatever reason just be unemployed.



Finally, I assume these rates have other things factored in- like the fact the new young people join the workforce every year. And, that since student loan payments were paused, and the average American doesn't just reduce spending, but increases their credit usage more ( when inflation strikes )



My thinking being, Jpow isn't going to unemployment go down because anyone who can afford to be unemployed already is, and no one else will be able to for a while. He said he would keep hiking till he saw uptick in unemployment, didn't he?

70,stocks,"*BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year*

Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 31.07.23, 08:15 AM

Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).

The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.

The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.

At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.

BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.

When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.

In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.

Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.

“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.

**Galloping run**

The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.

”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.

A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).

”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.

In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.

”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.

The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”

**Strategic role**

The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.

Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.

BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.

For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.

Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.

**Tightrope**

Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.

The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.

”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.

Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.

Comparing Kroger to other supermarket chains (like Walmart, Target or Cotsco) make the company seem extremely undervalued.

The biggest treat I can see is the competition from Whole Food and Amazon Fresh, but their stores aren't necesserely in the same cities, and taking over a grocery gigant like Kroger (2700 stores if I am not wrong) would be a very big task, requiring huge investments and crazy capex.

&lt;p&gt;The sales drop is the largest in over a decade, going back to 2009. The data indicates the economy remains sluggish, evidenced by reduced shipping and manufacturing needs. Cardboard box sales serve as an unusual recession indicator that has not rebounded yet.&lt;/p&gt;

97,stocks,"# INTRODUCTION:

GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.  


# REVENUE:

I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB's actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I'd assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. ([SOURCE](https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html))  
  
Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.  
  
REVENUE MODEL: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/q1x5t39))  


# COST:

A cost breakdown of GRAB as of FY22 is 94.6% Incentive given to drivers, 19.5% Marketing, 45.1% G&amp;A, 32.5% R&amp;D. The percentage adds to more than 100% because GRAB is losing money.   
  
  
Taking ComfortDelGro (Traditional Taxi) and Kakao (Superapp) as reference for how much the margins should be for GRAB.  
Kakao’s EBIT margins for FY21 and 22 is 9.7% and 8.2% respectively.  
“ComfortDelGro’s taxi earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin is…15.6% in 2019” ([SOURCE](https://sbr.com.sg/transport-logistics/news/comfortdelgro-taxis-profit-margin-shrinks-2-in-2020-maybank-kim-eng))  
Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB's main business of being a ride hailing app.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

Taxes, GRAB's taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%. GRAB is based on the Cayman islands, but it does not seem possible for them to avoid taxes and since most of their business operations are done in Southeast Asia, I’d assume they will eventually move to Singapore and pay Singapore taxes.  
  
NOLs, I assume that GRAB will turn profitable in 2027. Breakdown of NOL expiry dates ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/zurV11L)), Under the assumption that during the period of my forecast, no more NOLs are added. Unutilized NOLs as of 2022 are 3275M. Taking into account the time factor, NOLs are 2163M.  
  
Employee stock options, ESOs breakdown([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/d01avGW)) Using the treasury stock method, 19.9M stocks are added.  
  
Time to profit, It took KakaoTAXI 3 years to break even([SOURCE](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kakao-southkorea-idUSKCN1GP11O)). Because Kakao had already been a large player when they entered the ride sharing business and had been previously profitable, the market conditions are drastically different. I’d assume that GRAB takes about 7 years from the first year they started reporting their financials.  


Change in NWC, Opting for less granularity I'd assume that the day turnovers are average of historical data and assumed constant throughout  
Change in NWC Schedule: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/qLZNJs6))  
  
CapEX and D&amp;A, GRAB have been Net negative CapEX from 2019 - 2022. I’d assume that they ramp up Capital Expenditure for 3 years in line with management’s goal of wanting to fully penetrate into Southeast Asia which has yet to be substantially broken into by the company.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of ""Adjusted EBITDA"" but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring ""One-Time off transaction"" and in turn rewards managements for beating their ""Adjusted EBITDA"". They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don't like the tale the management constantly spins about ""Adjusted EBITDA"", it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.

&lt;p&gt;A cost breakdown of GRAB as of FY22 is 94.6% Incentive given to drivers, 19.5% Marketing, 45.1% G&amp;amp;A, 32.5% R&amp;amp;D. The percentage adds to more than 100% because GRAB is losing money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking ComfortDelGro (Traditional Taxi) and Kakao (Superapp) as reference for how much the margins should be for GRAB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kakao’s EBIT margins for FY21 and 22 is 9.7% and 8.2% respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ComfortDelGro’s taxi earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin is…15.6% in 2019” (&lt;a href=""https://sbr.com.sg/transport-logistics/news/comfortdelgro-taxis-profit-margin-shrinks-2-in-2020-maybank-kim-eng""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB&amp;#39;s main business of being a ride hailing app.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ASSUMPTIONS:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxes, GRAB&amp;#39;s taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%. GRAB is based on the Cayman islands, but it does not seem possible for them to avoid taxes and since most of their business operations are done in Southeast Asia, I’d assume they will eventually move to Singapore and pay Singapore taxes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOLs, I assume that GRAB will turn profitable in 2027. Breakdown of NOL expiry dates (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/zurV11L""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;), Under the assumption that during the period of my forecast, no more NOLs are added. Unutilized NOLs as of 2022 are 3275M. Taking into account the time factor, NOLs are 2163M.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employee stock options, ESOs breakdown(&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/d01avGW""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;) Using the treasury stock method, 19.9M stocks are added.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to profit, It took KakaoTAXI 3 years to break even(&lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kakao-southkorea-idUSKCN1GP11O""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;). Because Kakao had already been a large player when they entered the ride sharing business and had been previously profitable, the market conditions are drastically different. I’d assume that GRAB takes about 7 years from the first year they started reporting their financials.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change in NWC, Opting for less granularity I&amp;#39;d assume that the day turnovers are average of historical data and assumed constant throughout&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change in NWC Schedule: (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/qLZNJs6""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CapEX and D&amp;amp;A, GRAB have been Net negative CapEX from 2019 - 2022. I’d assume that they ramp up Capital Expenditure for 3 years in line with management’s goal of wanting to fully penetrate into Southeast Asia which has yet to be substantially broken into by the company.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WACC:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;COST OF EQUITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFR (1M Avg) = 3.82%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta = 0.88&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 Earnings Yield (1M Avg) = 4.25%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4050 = (4050 * 4.25%) * (1+16%) / (1+R) + [((4050 * 4.25%) * (1+16%)) * (1+3.82%) / (R - 3.82%)] / (1 + R) ^ 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R = 10.3%, ERP = 6.48%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COE = 9.52%  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;COST OF DEBT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRAB has a bond rating of BB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BB Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 6.92%  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WEIGHTAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOAN Schedule: (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/LkS6vl5""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt = 1400M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share Price (1M Avg) = $3.49&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares O/S = 3968M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market Value of Equity = 13848M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;%Equity = 90.8%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;%Debt = 10.2%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marginal Tax Rate = 17%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WACC = 8.65%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of &amp;quot;Adjusted EBITDA&amp;quot; but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring &amp;quot;One-Time off transaction&amp;quot; and in turn rewards managements for beating their &amp;quot;Adjusted EBITDA&amp;quot;. They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don&amp;#39;t like the tale the management constantly spins about &amp;quot;Adjusted EBITDA&amp;quot;, it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.&lt;/p&gt;

99,stocks,"Let's summarize the reasons why INTC is at the current price:

* \- Lagging behind in technology
* \- Poor track record of management
* \- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history
* \- Losing market share in most segments
* \- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues
* \- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush
* \- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days

&amp;#x200B;

Still, let's underline some facts:

**Market valuation landscape:**

* \- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold.
* \- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.

**Strategy:**

Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:

* \- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)
* \- Catching up to TSMC's tech

They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.

Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**

The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.

If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.

We already have positive things to say about their execution:

* \- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.
* \- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.
* \- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.
* \- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irrational fears:**

* \- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:

Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.

* \- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:

Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

*****
&gt; Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.
*****
&gt; Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.
*****

&gt; “Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”

I am 33M.  

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.  

I started getting more serious and doing a lot more research in the last year or so and have accepted my losses and sold off my bad investments.  I've now invested in a mix of growth/ETFs like VOO, SCHD, AAPL, and TSLA

I have two others in SPYD (don't ask why) and AUTL (hoping they get acquired) but not a significant amount in either. The rest of the money I just keep as SPAXX in Fidelity 

Lately, I just feel like the ""safest"" and more guaranteed return on investments are CDs and T-Bills given the interest rates they are offering (5% - 5.5%). I am in the process of setting up a CD/T-Bills ladder where I'd have maturing CDs or T-Bills monthly starting later this year. 

Should I continue with this approach? I know the interest rates will fluctuate and may not always be high but I haven't seen any of my investments besides TSLA really take off (AAPL has done decent). As noted above, I actually lost a good amount in the past.  

Right now, my goal is to not think about it everyday and just have my money grow over time (I will not need the cash). Should I just put it all in VOO? Leave it in SPAXX? Or just continue the ladder strategy? Are there any risks I'm not considering?

112,stocks,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html

Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA on Tuesday, pointing to “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,” as well as a growing general debt burden.

Back in May, the agency placed the nation’s AAA rating on negative watch, blaming the debt ceiling fight. At the time, lawmakers in Washington butted heads over an agreement that would keep the federal government from running out of money. President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill on June 2, just days away from the “X-date” on June 5.

The country’s recent debt limit feud was mentioned again in the downgrade.

“In Fitch’s view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025,” the ratings agency said.

“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” Fitch said.

The agency also highlighted the rising general government deficit, which it anticipates will rise to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. “Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending (15% of total federal spending) as agreed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act offer only a modest improvement to the medium-term fiscal outlook,” Fitch said.

The agency also noted that a combination of tightening credit conditions, weakening business investment and a slowdown in consumption could lead the economy into a “mild” recession in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of next year.

This isn’t the first time a rating agency has downgraded the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2011 after Washington managed to avoid a default. At the time, the agency highlighted political risk as part of its reasoning.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Amazon is opening up its Fresh grocery delivery service to people without Prime in select U.S. cities.

Amazon will charge non-Prime members $13.95 for deliveries under $50, while orders between $50 and $100 will incur a $10.95 fee, and orders over $100 will carry a $7.95 delivery fee.

# [Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”
*****
&gt; A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.
*****
&gt; “I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.
*****
&gt; CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.

120,stocks,"For those of you not caught up, a paper was published out of Korea stating that a room temperature ambient pressure superconductor has been created. The initial peer reviews and attempts to recreate this experiment actually look positive.

If room temperature semiconductors have actually been discovered, they will become a part of nearly all technology/power grid related things. Simply put, there would be huge amounts of money to be made. What are some ideas on how to play this? My personal ideas have been:

This significant expansion demonstrates BKNG's capacity to increase its market presence and successfully seize commercial opportunities over time.  
BKNG's growth prospects are still bright; during the next five years, double-digit earnings growth is anticipated in all but one year. The corporation is anticipated to keep growing its revenues and operating well in the years to come, according to this optimistic prognosis. Going forward, BKNG's connected journey strategy will be one of the primary growth drivers. This approach is based on personalising the travel experience for each consumer utilising data and technology. According to each person's interests, hotels and activities are suggested, and travel schedules are updated in real time.  
There are some risks involved with investing in BKNG because of their business style. Being a business that focuses on travel, BKNG's success is closely correlated with that of the travel sector. Travel spending may decline during economic downturns, which could have an effect on BKNG's operations. While I still believe in the travel sector's long-term promise, I also recognise that it is vulnerable to unanticipated occurrences like the COVID-19 pandemic, which might once again cause travel to be disrupted.  
Despite these dangers, a number of factors are driving future expansion. Since a few years ago, BKNG has made significant investments in AI technology, further demonstrating their dedication to provide consumers with trips that are more connected and personalised. By using AI to analyse information in several languages and provide personalised recommendations, BKNG hopes to improve relationships with customers and partners.   
While other BKNG brands are working to incorporate this technology into their own offers, others, like KAYAK and OpenTable, are actively experimenting with generative AI plug-ins. BKNG is well-positioned to create an engaging and distinctive booking experience, customised to match the various demands of its consumers, thanks to a solid AI base.

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks with Tesla Inc., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and other automakers about supplying them with lithium as the oil giant works to build a business around the crucial battery metal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Exxon is one of several oil and gas companies seeking to expand into lithium production to take advantage of surging demand for use in electric-vehicle batteries, and as a way of diversifying beyond fossil fuels. The talks with potential customers are still early stage, and the company has yet to lay out its plans for potential lithium operations. However, the discussions are the latest sign of Exxon’s growing interest in the lithium business.

The company has also had conversations with battery giants Samsung and SK On Co., the people said, asking not to be named because the information is private. Exxon, SK On and Volkswagen declined to comment. Tesla, Ford and Samsung didn’t reply to messages seeking comment.

The rapid global roll out of electric vehicles has raised the risk of bottlenecks and shortages for key battery materials like lithium, sparking a rush to invest in and secure supply.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.
[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html""&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street’s busiest earnings week continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.
*****
&gt; Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.
*****
&gt; More than 160 S&amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.
*****
&gt; To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.
*****
&gt; “We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”
*****
&gt; He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.
*****
&gt; “As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.
*****
&gt; Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, August 1st, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading month of August and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Tuesday, August the 1st, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall as Wall Street’s busiest earnings week continues: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 160 S&amp;amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.&lt;/p&gt;

[This website lists the YTD price performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance), so not including dividends.

Number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 over ___ YTD:

- 30% YTD: 75

- 50% YTD: 27
- 60% YTD: 15

About 172 stocks have a possibly negative YTD price return (again, excluding dividends). 328 are positive YTD.

&lt;p&gt;Kamich&amp;#39;s daily point and figure chart pointed to a price target equivalent to Truist Securities analyst Andrew Jeffrey&amp;#39;s newly raised price target of $16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Kamich&amp;#39;s used a Point and Figure chart that showed a much higher $21 price target (an 83.4% upside from the July 31st closing price of $11.45.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SoFi stock will continue to have its ups and downs but Noto has reiterated that SoFi is growing with an increase in 2023 guidance and profitability in the fourth quarter. The extra push from additional student loans toward the end of the year is just the icing on the cake.  SoFi stock has gained momentum with all its cylinders firing pushing towards the upward path of least resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by $2.7 billion, up 26% during the second quarter to $12.7 billion at quarterend, and over 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are from direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the second quarter, the median FICO score was 747. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans. Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. SoFi Bank, N.A. generated $63.1 million of GAAP net income at a 17% margin.”

SoFi continues to thrive in this macro environment:

* Galileo, Technisys, and bank charter form the pillars for SoFi to become ""The AWS of Fintech""
* The acquisition of Wyndham Capital on April 3rd completes the three arms of lending under one umbrella. This cut off the middleman fee and maximizes profitability for the most lucrative segment of SoFi's businesses.
* The wide diversity of SoFi business allows it to thrive in any macro environment.
* SoFi's Savings with direct deposit APY of 4.4% gives an extra push for deposit growth in subsequent quarters.
* SoFi Checking and Savings Offers Access to Up to $2 Million in FDIC Insurance ensuring depositors that their money above $250K won't go up in smoke.

I had a few shares of NTDOY recently on a dividend payout with this cost structure info

1 share NTDOY (currently trades $11.28) is 1/4th of Nintendo 7974.T stock  
Dividend declared 123 yen/share or 30.75 yen/NTDOY   
Dividend received in US account on July 11th when yen to dollar was 140.27yen/dollar  
Dividend I received of $0.214 per NTDOY after-foreign taxes withheld and conversion to the dollar  
This means 0.214 was received when the conversion would be 0.219 so approx -3% to taxes  
ADR maintenance fee charged after the dividend of $0.0299 / share meaning $0.1841 received  


Final net of 0.1841/share on estimated 0.219 payout is 84% efficiency or in other words -16% of the dividend payout goes to foreign taxes and also ADR fees before US taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a similar experience seeing about 16% of the yield value go out the door to ADR?  While I like NTDOY, I was curious if NTDOF has a lower fee in the end, was wondering if anyone is holding it and wants to look at it and compare?

165,stocks,"Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.

More than 1 million Netflix accounts and around 800,000 Disney+ subscribers in the U.S. are on ad-supported tiers, according to Ampere, representing nearly 2% of each service’s total subscriber base. The firm estimates that more than 90% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad-supported tier, representing around 45 million subscriptions.

Prior to the launch of Max, Discovery+ had somewhere in the region of 10 million ad-supported accounts, while HBO Max had around 2 million, Ampere said. It added that Peacock has more than 30 million ad-supported subscribers, the most of any new U.S. OTT service, while Paramount+ has more than 25 million ad-supported subscribers in the U.S.

Ampere believes that hybrid services are “an increasingly important element of streaming service monetization, and hybrid tiers often generate more revenue per subscription than their ad-free counterparts.” It also says that the tiers “represent a way for consumers to maintain a wider array of subscriptions while economic times remain tough.”

Ampere’s latest research comes as earnings season for the major studios is in full swing.

Netflix, which recently eliminated its basic ad-free plan in the United States as it expands its password sharing crackdown, added 5.9 million paid subscribers during the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 238.4 million globally. During its upfront presentation to advertisers in May, Netflix reported that the ad tier had nearly 5 million monthly active users.

Meanwhile, NBCUniversal parent Comcast reported that Peacock had a total of 24 million paid subscribers. The streaming service, which dropped its free tier for new users in January, recently said it would bump up the price for its Premium and Premium Plus tiers to $5.99 and $11.99, respectively, which will take effect on Aug. 17. Due to certain streaming rights and contracts with content providers, some Peacock content still has ads.

Next up on the earnings docket will be Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its Max rebrand on May 23 — which offers a $9.99 per month Max Ad Lite tier, $15.99 per month Max Ad Free tier and $19.99 per month Max Ultimate Ad Free tier.

170,stocks,"*BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year*

Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 31.07.23, 08:15 AM

Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).

The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.

The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.

At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.

BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.

When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.

In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.

Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.

“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.

**Galloping run**

The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.

”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.

A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).

”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.

In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.

”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.

The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”

**Strategic role**

The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.

Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.

BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.

For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.

Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.

**Tightrope**

Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.

The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.

”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.

Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.

&lt;p&gt;Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 31.07.23, 08:15 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galloping run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightrope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT.

Walmart for example has a PE of almost 40, against Kroger 14, Walmart revenues are 1.5 times its market cap, Kroger&amp;#39;s are over 4 times. Similar arguments could be made for other competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By looking at the company I havent seen many problems either. Revenues are growing, and so are EPS, the debt is decreasing and the margins are quite stable. Operating income has risen a lot and the number of outstanding share has been going down. It really doesn&amp;#39;t look bad compared to other companies in the same sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest treat I can see is the competition from Whole Food and Amazon Fresh, but their stores aren&amp;#39;t necesserely in the same cities, and taking over a grocery gigant like Kroger (2700 stores if I am not wrong) would be a very big task, requiring huge investments and crazy capex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus for the strong expected economic growth of the USA, especially the states where Kroger is well established, like Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

3. **Price goes down (example, share price decrease to $8.00)** \- You lose $200 from the stock decreasing. You gain $50.00 from the sale of the contract. Net loss - $150

GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.  


# REVENUE:

I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB's actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I'd assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. ([SOURCE](https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html))  
  
Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.

# COST:

A cost breakdown of GRAB as of FY22 is 94.6% Incentive given to drivers, 19.5% Marketing, 45.1% G&amp;A, 32.5% R&amp;D. The percentage adds to more than 100% because GRAB is losing money.   
  
  
Taking ComfortDelGro (Traditional Taxi) and Kakao (Superapp) as reference for how much the margins should be for GRAB.  
Kakao’s EBIT margins for FY21 and 22 is 9.7% and 8.2% respectively.

Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB's main business of being a ride hailing app.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

Taxes, GRAB's taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%. GRAB is based on the Cayman islands, but it does not seem possible for them to avoid taxes and since most of their business operations are done in Southeast Asia, I’d assume they will eventually move to Singapore and pay Singapore taxes.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of ""Adjusted EBITDA"" but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring ""One-Time off transaction"" and in turn rewards managements for beating their ""Adjusted EBITDA"". They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don't like the tale the management constantly spins about ""Adjusted EBITDA"", it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.

199,stocks,"Let's summarize the reasons why INTC is at the current price:

* \- Lagging behind in technology
* \- Poor track record of management
* \- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history
* \- Losing market share in most segments
* \- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues
* \- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush
* \- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days

&amp;#x200B;

Still, let's underline some facts:

**Market valuation landscape:**

* \- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold.
* \- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.

**Strategy:**

Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:

* \- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)
* \- Catching up to TSMC's tech

They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.

Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**

The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.

If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.

We already have positive things to say about their execution:

* \- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.
* \- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.
* \- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.
* \- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irrational fears:**

* \- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:

Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.

* \- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:

Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you for your points of view, they give me more to think about. After all, my goal is to make the most fair case and orient my thoughts, as I see no good or current publication about this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s summarize the reasons why INTC is at the current price:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Lagging behind in technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Poor track record of management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Losing market share in most segments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, let&amp;#39;s underline some facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market valuation landscape:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Catching up to TSMC&amp;#39;s tech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn&amp;#39;t worry too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have positive things to say about their execution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irrational fears:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

*****
&gt; Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.
*****
&gt; Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.
*****
&gt; “Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”
*****
&gt; In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Thursday, August 3rd, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Thursday, August the 3rd, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall after U.S. downgrade spurs a sell-off, traders scrutinize latest earnings: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures tied to the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I am 33M.  

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.  

I started getting more serious and doing a lot more research in the last year or so and have accepted my losses and sold off my bad investments.  I've now invested in a mix of growth/ETFs like VOO, SCHD, AAPL, and TSLA

I have two others in SPYD (don't ask why) and AUTL (hoping they get acquired) but not a significant amount in either. The rest of the money I just keep as SPAXX in Fidelity 

Lately, I just feel like the ""safest"" and more guaranteed return on investments are CDs and T-Bills given the interest rates they are offering (5% - 5.5%). I am in the process of setting up a CD/T-Bills ladder where I'd have maturing CDs or T-Bills monthly starting later this year. 

Should I continue with this approach? I know the interest rates will fluctuate and may not always be high but I haven't seen any of my investments besides TSLA really take off (AAPL has done decent). As noted above, I actually lost a good amount in the past.  

Right now, my goal is to not think about it everyday and just have my money grow over time (I will not need the cash). Should I just put it all in VOO? Leave it in SPAXX? Or just continue the ladder strategy? Are there any risks I'm not considering?

I also have some money just sitting in Robinhood, which earns me 4.9% APY (with gold). Most of it is in Fidelity.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;

Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA on Tuesday, pointing to “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,” as well as a growing general debt burden.

Back in May, the agency placed the nation’s AAA rating on negative watch, blaming the debt ceiling fight. At the time, lawmakers in Washington butted heads over an agreement that would keep the federal government from running out of money. President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill on June 2, just days away from the “X-date” on June 5.

The country’s recent debt limit feud was mentioned again in the downgrade.

“In Fitch’s view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025,” the ratings agency said.

“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” Fitch said.

The agency also highlighted the rising general government deficit, which it anticipates will rise to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. “Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending (15% of total federal spending) as agreed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act offer only a modest improvement to the medium-term fiscal outlook,” Fitch said.

The agency also noted that a combination of tightening credit conditions, weakening business investment and a slowdown in consumption could lead the economy into a “mild” recession in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of next year.

This isn’t the first time a rating agency has downgraded the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2011 after Washington managed to avoid a default.

As the tech giant prepares to release its earnings report, analysts emphasise the significance of revealing its utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost growth.

Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv.
Specifically, iPhone sales are anticipated to have declined by over 2% during this period, based on a survey of 24 analysts conducted by Visible Alpha. This contrasts with a nearly 3% increase in sales during the same quarter last year and a 1.5% rise in the preceding quarter (January-March).

# [Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”
*****
&gt; A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.
*****
&gt; “I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.
*****
&gt; CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Wednesday, August 2nd, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Wednesday, August the 2nd, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.&lt;/p&gt;

The company released its second-quarter financial results on Thursday. The U.S.-based automaker's EV division, called ""Ford Model e,"" has lost $1.8 billion so far this year, according to Fortune.

The projected $4.5 billion loss is over twice as much as Model e's $2.1 billion loss in 2022. The company recently announced that the price of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks will be reduced due to cheaper raw battery materials.

The company touted that its low EV prices ""establish[es] leadership ahead of industry’s next-generation EVs"" and that the Ford Model e's revenue is up 39%. Ford is also expected to produce 600,000 EVs per year by 2024.

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks with Tesla Inc., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and other automakers about supplying them with lithium as the oil giant works to build a business around the crucial battery metal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Exxon is one of several oil and gas companies seeking to expand into lithium production to take advantage of surging demand for use in electric-vehicle batteries, and as a way of diversifying beyond fossil fuels. The talks with potential customers are still early stage, and the company has yet to lay out its plans for potential lithium operations. However, the discussions are the latest sign of Exxon’s growing interest in the lithium business.

The company has also had conversations with battery giants Samsung and SK On Co., the people said, asking not to be named because the information is private. Exxon, SK On and Volkswagen declined to comment. Tesla, Ford and Samsung didn’t reply to messages seeking comment.

The rapid global roll out of electric vehicles has raised the risk of bottlenecks and shortages for key battery materials like lithium, sparking a rush to invest in and secure supply.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html""&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.
*****
&gt; Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.
*****
&gt; More than 160 S&amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.
*****
&gt; To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.
*****
&gt; “We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”
*****
&gt; He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.
*****
&gt; “As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.
*****
&gt; Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.

Below is a table of all US recessions in the last 50 years with numbers on the yield curve inversion that occurred prior and any drawdowns that occurred in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by $2.7 billion, up 26% during the second quarter to $12.7 billion at quarterend, and over 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are from direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the second quarter, the median FICO score was 747. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans. Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. SoFi Bank, N.A. generated $63.1 million of GAAP net income at a 17% margin.”

SoFi continues to thrive in this macro environment:

* Galileo, Technisys, and bank charter form the pillars for SoFi to become ""The AWS of Fintech""
* The acquisition of Wyndham Capital on April 3rd completes the three arms of lending under one umbrella. This cut off the middleman fee and maximizes profitability for the most lucrative segment of SoFi's businesses.
* The wide diversity of SoFi business allows it to thrive in any macro environment.
* SoFi's Savings with direct deposit APY of 4.4% gives an extra push for deposit growth in subsequent quarters.
* SoFi Checking and Savings Offers Access to Up to $2 Million in FDIC Insurance ensuring depositors that their money above $250K won't go up in smoke.

I had a few shares of NTDOY recently on a dividend payout with this cost structure info

1 share NTDOY (currently trades $11.28) is 1/4th of Nintendo 7974.T stock  
Dividend declared 123 yen/share or 30.75 yen/NTDOY   
Dividend received in US account on July 11th when yen to dollar was 140.27yen/dollar  
Dividend I received of $0.214 per NTDOY after-foreign taxes withheld and conversion to the dollar  
This means 0.214 was received when the conversion would be 0.219 so approx -3% to taxes  
ADR maintenance fee charged after the dividend of $0.0299 / share meaning $0.1841 received  


Final net of 0.1841/share on estimated 0.219 payout is 84% efficiency or in other words -16% of the dividend payout goes to foreign taxes and also ADR fees before US taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a similar experience seeing about 16% of the yield value go out the door to ADR?  While I like NTDOY, I was curious if NTDOF has a lower fee in the end, was wondering if anyone is holding it and wants to look at it and compare? 

The ADRS trade at the same relative price adjusting for share % but in my view if one has significantly lower fees it would be a better buy.

265,stocks,"Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.

More than 1 million Netflix accounts and around 800,000 Disney+ subscribers in the U.S. are on ad-supported tiers, according to Ampere, representing nearly 2% of each service’s total subscriber base. The firm estimates that more than 90% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad-supported tier, representing around 45 million subscriptions.

Prior to the launch of Max, Discovery+ had somewhere in the region of 10 million ad-supported accounts, while HBO Max had around 2 million, Ampere said. It added that Peacock has more than 30 million ad-supported subscribers, the most of any new U.S. OTT service, while Paramount+ has more than 25 million ad-supported subscribers in the U.S.

Ampere believes that hybrid services are “an increasingly important element of streaming service monetization, and hybrid tiers often generate more revenue per subscription than their ad-free counterparts.” It also says that the tiers “represent a way for consumers to maintain a wider array of subscriptions while economic times remain tough.”

Ampere’s latest research comes as earnings season for the major studios is in full swing.

Netflix, which recently eliminated its basic ad-free plan in the United States as it expands its password sharing crackdown, added 5.9 million paid subscribers during the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 238.4 million globally. During its upfront presentation to advertisers in May, Netflix reported that the ad tier had nearly 5 million monthly active users.

Meanwhile, NBCUniversal parent Comcast reported that Peacock had a total of 24 million paid subscribers. The streaming service, which dropped its free tier for new users in January, recently said it would bump up the price for its Premium and Premium Plus tiers to $5.99 and $11.99, respectively, which will take effect on Aug. 17. Due to certain streaming rights and contracts with content providers, some Peacock content still has ads.

Next up on the earnings docket will be Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its Max rebrand on May 23 — which offers a $9.99 per month Max Ad Lite tier, $15.99 per month Max Ad Free tier and $19.99 per month Max Ultimate Ad Free tier.

Meanwhile, Paramount Global, which charges $5.99 per month for its ad-supported option, and Disney, which launched its $7.99 per month ad-supported Disney+ tier in November, will report earnings on Aug. 7 and 9, respectively.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 1 million Netflix accounts and around 800,000 Disney+ subscribers in the U.S. are on ad-supported tiers, according to Ampere, representing nearly 2% of each service’s total subscriber base. The firm estimates that more than 90% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad-supported tier, representing around 45 million subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

270,stocks,"*BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year*

Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 31.07.23, 08:15 AM

Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).

The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.

The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.

At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.

BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.

When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.

In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.

Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.

“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.

**Galloping run**

The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.

”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.

A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).

”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.

In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.

”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.

The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”

**Strategic role**

The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.

Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.

BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.

For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.

Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.

**Tightrope**

Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.

The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.

”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.

Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.

Comparing Kroger to other supermarket chains (like Walmart, Target or Cotsco) make the company seem extremely undervalued.

The biggest treat I can see is the competition from Whole Food and Amazon Fresh, but their stores aren't necesserely in the same cities, and taking over a grocery gigant like Kroger (2700 stores if I am not wrong) would be a very big task, requiring huge investments and crazy capex.

282,stocks,"I am curious about selling covered calls, but I feel like I'm missing some hidden element of risk.

Let's say a stock is $10.00, and you buy 100 shares. You now sell 1 contract (100 shares) at a strike price of $12.00 for $0.50 each ($50 contract).

Am I understanding how selling covered calls work, in that the following are the possible outcomes?

1. **Share price rises to strike price ($12)** \- You make $200.00 from the stock increasing, plus $50 for the sale of the contract. You are obligated to sell 100 shares for $12.00 each to the buyer. Your net profit is $250.00.
2. **Price goes way up, (example, share price increase to $50.00)** \- You make $200.00 from the stock increasing, but you don't profit any further than your strike price. Also, $5 for the sale of the contract. You are obligated to sell your 100 shares for $12.00 each to the buyer. Your net profit is $250.00.
3. **Price goes down (example, share price decrease to $8.00)** \- You lose $200 from the stock decreasing. You gain $50.00 from the sale of the contract. Net loss - $150

Is there any other possible thing that can happen, or am I missing some hidden risk? If I'm not missing something, then if anyone has significant shares of any given company, for what reason would they NOT be selling covered calls all day every day, at strike prices that are unlikely to occur?

297,stocks,"# INTRODUCTION:

GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.  


# REVENUE:

I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB's actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I'd assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. ([SOURCE](https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html))  
  
Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.

Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB's main business of being a ride hailing app.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

Taxes, GRAB's taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of ""Adjusted EBITDA"" but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring ""One-Time off transaction"" and in turn rewards managements for beating their ""Adjusted EBITDA"". They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don't like the tale the management constantly spins about ""Adjusted EBITDA"", it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;INTRODUCTION:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;REVENUE:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB&amp;#39;s actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I&amp;#39;d assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. (&lt;a href=""https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.  &lt;/p&gt;

* \- Lagging behind in technology
* \- Poor track record of management
* \- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history
* \- Losing market share in most segments
* \- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues
* \- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush
* \- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days

&amp;#x200B;

Still, let's underline some facts:

**Market valuation landscape:**

* \- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold.
* \- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.

**Strategy:**

Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:

* \- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)
* \- Catching up to TSMC's tech

They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.

Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**

The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.

If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.

We already have positive things to say about their execution:

* \- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.
* \- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.
* \- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.
* \- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irrational fears:**

* \- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:

Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.

* \- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:

Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.

I am 33M.  

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.  

I started getting more serious and doing a lot more research in the last year or so and have accepted my losses and sold off my bad investments.  I've now invested in a mix of growth/ETFs like VOO, SCHD, AAPL, and TSLA

I have two others in SPYD (don't ask why) and AUTL (hoping they get acquired) but not a significant amount in either. The rest of the money I just keep as SPAXX in Fidelity 

Lately, I just feel like the ""safest"" and more guaranteed return on investments are CDs and T-Bills given the interest rates they are offering (5% - 5.5%). I am in the process of setting up a CD/T-Bills ladder where I'd have maturing CDs or T-Bills monthly starting later this year. 

Should I continue with this approach? I know the interest rates will fluctuate and may not always be high but I haven't seen any of my investments besides TSLA really take off (AAPL has done decent). As noted above, I actually lost a good amount in the past.  

Right now, my goal is to not think about it everyday and just have my money grow over time (I will not need the cash). Should I just put it all in VOO? Leave it in SPAXX? Or just continue the ladder strategy? Are there any risks I'm not considering?

Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA on Tuesday, pointing to “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,” as well as a growing general debt burden.

Back in May, the agency placed the nation’s AAA rating on negative watch, blaming the debt ceiling fight. At the time, lawmakers in Washington butted heads over an agreement that would keep the federal government from running out of money. President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill on June 2, just days away from the “X-date” on June 5.

The country’s recent debt limit feud was mentioned again in the downgrade.

“In Fitch’s view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025,” the ratings agency said.

“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” Fitch said.

The agency also highlighted the rising general government deficit, which it anticipates will rise to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. “Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending (15% of total federal spending) as agreed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act offer only a modest improvement to the medium-term fiscal outlook,” Fitch said.

The agency also noted that a combination of tightening credit conditions, weakening business investment and a slowdown in consumption could lead the economy into a “mild” recession in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of next year.

This isn’t the first time a rating agency has downgraded the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2011 after Washington managed to avoid a default. At the time, the agency highlighted political risk as part of its reasoning.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Amazon is opening up its Fresh grocery delivery service to people without Prime in select U.S. cities. Users in a dozen cities, including San Francisco, Boston, Nashville, Tennessee, and Austin, Texas, will be able to access the service. Amazon will charge non-Prime members $13.95 for deliveries under $50, while orders between $50 and $100 will incur a $10.95 fee, and orders over $100 will carry a $7.95 delivery fee. Previously, only members of Amazon’s $139-a-year Prime program could order groceries from Fresh.

Amazon launched Fresh in 2007, marking the e-commerce giant’s first foray into selling groceries online. In the years since, it has doubled down on the grocery market, buying Whole Foods a decade later for $13.7 billion. It also operates a chain of Fresh supermarkets, and Go cashier-less convenience stores. The efforts have delivered mixed results. It has struggled to integrate Fresh and Whole Foods. As part of a companywide review of expenses, CEO Andy Jassy announced earlier this year Amazon would close some Fresh and Go stores, and pause further expansion until it finds a format that resonates with customers and “where we like the economics.” Last week, Amazon cut some jobs at Fresh grocery stores. And earlier this year, amid mounting costs, Amazon said it would start charging delivery fees on Fresh grocery orders under $150, removing an earlier perk that guaranteed Prime members free delivery on orders over $35.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/02/amazon-fresh-grocery-delivery-opens-to-people-without-prime.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/02/amazon-fresh-grocery-delivery-opens-to-people-without-prime.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It also operates a chain of Fresh supermarkets, and Go cashier-less convenience stores. The efforts have delivered mixed results. It has struggled to integrate Fresh and Whole Foods. As part of a companywide review of expenses, CEO Andy Jassy announced earlier this year Amazon would close some Fresh and Go stores, and pause further expansion until it finds a format that resonates with customers and “where we like the economics.” Last week, Amazon cut some jobs at Fresh grocery stores. And earlier this year, amid mounting costs, Amazon said it would start charging delivery fees on Fresh grocery orders under $150, removing an earlier perk that guaranteed Prime members free delivery on orders over $35.&lt;/p&gt;

As the tech giant prepares to release its earnings report, analysts emphasise the significance of revealing its utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost growth.

Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv.
Specifically, iPhone sales are anticipated to have declined by over 2% during this period, based on a survey of 24 analysts conducted by Visible Alpha. This contrasts with a nearly 3% increase in sales during the same quarter last year and a 1.5% rise in the preceding quarter (January-March).

The upcoming quarterly report may serve as a deviation from the positive earnings trend observed in other prominent tech companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Microsoft. These companies have demonstrated resilience in their cloud-based operations and have witnessed a surge in digital ad sales.
""Apple is not immune to general macroeconomic trends and will continue to set the pace (for the smartphone industry) for quite some time,"" Reuters quoted Bob O'Donnell, founder of TECHnalysis Research, as saying.
In September, analysts anticipate the unveiling of the much-anticipated iPhone 15, which could feature the widely accepted USB-C port on certain models. This development may provide a slight boost to iPhone sales during the July-September quarter, according to market experts, who have differing opinions on the overall performance during this period.

# [Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”
*****
&gt; A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.
*****
&gt; “I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.
*****
&gt; CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CVS Health&lt;/strong&gt; — Shares of the retail pharmacy giant rose 1.8% premarket after the company posted strong earnings and revenue for the second quarter. CVS reported earnings of $2.21 per share on revenue of $88.9 billion. Wall Street analysts expected $2.11 per share on earnings of $86.5 billion, according to Refinitiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norwegian Cruise Line&lt;/strong&gt; — The stock fell 3.2% in premarket trading after the company posted its earnings results on Tuesday, which indicated weaker-than-expected guidance for the third quarter. The cruise ship operator topped Wall Street’s estimates, however. On Wednesday, Susquehanna downgraded its rating on Norwegian shares to neutral from positive. It maintained its price target of $17, which suggests a 12.4% downside from Tuesday’s close.&lt;/p&gt;

The company also reported earnings per share of 7 cents, surpassing Wall Street’s estimate of 2 cents.

318,stocks,"I have a smaller (\~10k) account, which I currently put about $150 into each month (as well as reinvesting dividends automatically). It's not much, but it's something that I've been growing and adding to for just under 10 years now.  
I am looking for advice on areas that I should be diversifying into more. I started my account with a beginner friendly service, and that led me to have a lot of similar types of ETFs early on, eventually adding worldwide ETFs later on.

This significant expansion demonstrates BKNG's capacity to increase its market presence and successfully seize commercial opportunities over time.  
BKNG's growth prospects are still bright; during the next five years, double-digit earnings growth is anticipated in all but one year. The corporation is anticipated to keep growing its revenues and operating well in the years to come, according to this optimistic prognosis. Going forward, BKNG's connected journey strategy will be one of the primary growth drivers. This approach is based on personalising the travel experience for each consumer utilising data and technology. According to each person's interests, hotels and activities are suggested, and travel schedules are updated in real time.  
There are some risks involved with investing in BKNG because of their business style. Being a business that focuses on travel, BKNG's success is closely correlated with that of the travel sector. Travel spending may decline during economic downturns, which could have an effect on BKNG's operations. While I still believe in the travel sector's long-term promise, I also recognise that it is vulnerable to unanticipated occurrences like the COVID-19 pandemic, which might once again cause travel to be disrupted.  
Despite these dangers, a number of factors are driving future expansion. Since a few years ago, BKNG has made significant investments in AI technology, further demonstrating their dedication to provide consumers with trips that are more connected and personalised. By using AI to analyse information in several languages and provide personalised recommendations, BKNG hopes to improve relationships with customers and partners.   
While other BKNG brands are working to incorporate this technology into their own offers, others, like KAYAK and OpenTable, are actively experimenting with generative AI plug-ins. BKNG is well-positioned to create an engaging and distinctive booking experience, customised to match the various demands of its consumers, thanks to a solid AI base. By utilising AI, I think BKNG will continue to lead the travel sector, constantly enhancing its offerings to give clients the greatest experience possible while encouraging long-term, significant shareholder development.

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks with Tesla Inc., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and other automakers about supplying them with lithium as the oil giant works to build a business around the crucial battery metal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Exxon is one of several oil and gas companies seeking to expand into lithium production to take advantage of surging demand for use in electric-vehicle batteries, and as a way of diversifying beyond fossil fuels. The talks with potential customers are still early stage, and the company has yet to lay out its plans for potential lithium operations. However, the discussions are the latest sign of Exxon’s growing interest in the lithium business.

The company has also had conversations with battery giants Samsung and SK On Co., the people said, asking not to be named because the information is private. Exxon, SK On and Volkswagen declined to comment. Tesla, Ford and Samsung didn’t reply to messages seeking comment.

The rapid global roll out of electric vehicles has raised the risk of bottlenecks and shortages for key battery materials like lithium, sparking a rush to invest in and secure supply.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.
[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street’s busiest earnings week continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.
*****
&gt; Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.
*****
&gt; More than 160 S&amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.
*****
&gt; To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.
*****
&gt; “We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”
*****
&gt; He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.
*****
&gt; “As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.
*****
&gt; Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.

About 172 stocks have a possibly negative YTD price return (again, excluding dividends). 328 are positive YTD.

Upshot: No, this is not a rally being driven by 7 stocks anymore. All sectors are starting to catch a bid, especially ones beaten down in 2023 like energy and financials.

&lt;li&gt;VXUS is up 3.5% in July and 11.9% YTD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 Sectors in July using Marketwatch Data: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy: +7.3%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communications sector: +6.7%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financials +4.7%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Materials: +3.4%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industrials  +2.9%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Technology: +2.6%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumer discretionary: +2.4%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilities: +2.4%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumer Staples: +2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real Estate: +1.2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthcare: +0.9%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I manually checked Healthcare, Real Estate, Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Materials. The other sectors I took from the linked article below)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-narrow-breadth-chorus-has-fallen-silent-what-broadening-participation-in-stock-market-rally-means-for-investors-cc6a8af5""&gt;Source: Marketwatch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance""&gt;This website lists the YTD price performance of stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt;, so not including dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500 over ___ YTD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% YTD: 128&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30% YTD: 75&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40% YTD: 47&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50% YTD: 27&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60% YTD: 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 172 stocks have a possibly negative YTD price return (again, excluding dividends). 328 are positive YTD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upshot: No, this is not a rally being driven by 7 stocks anymore. All sectors are starting to catch a bid, especially ones beaten down in 2023 like energy and financials. Even as Europe and China teeter on recession, we&amp;#39;re seeing international stocks also rally.&lt;/p&gt;

Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by $2.7 billion, up 26% during the second quarter to $12.7 billion at quarterend, and over 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are from direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the second quarter, the median FICO score was 747. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans. Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty.

I had a few shares of NTDOY recently on a dividend payout with this cost structure info

1 share NTDOY (currently trades $11.28) is 1/4th of Nintendo 7974.T stock  
Dividend declared 123 yen/share or 30.75 yen/NTDOY   
Dividend received in US account on July 11th when yen to dollar was 140.27yen/dollar  
Dividend I received of $0.214 per NTDOY after-foreign taxes withheld and conversion to the dollar  
This means 0.214 was received when the conversion would be 0.219 so approx -3% to taxes  
ADR maintenance fee charged after the dividend of $0.0299 / share meaning $0.1841 received  


Final net of 0.1841/share on estimated 0.219 payout is 84% efficiency or in other words -16% of the dividend payout goes to foreign taxes and also ADR fees before US taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a similar experience seeing about 16% of the yield value go out the door to ADR?  While I like NTDOY, I was curious if NTDOF has a lower fee in the end, was wondering if anyone is holding it and wants to look at it and compare? 

The ADRS trade at the same relative price adjusting for share % but in my view if one has significantly lower fees it would be a better buy.

365,stocks,"Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.

More than 1 million Netflix accounts and around 800,000 Disney+ subscribers in the U.S. are on ad-supported tiers, according to Ampere, representing nearly 2% of each service’s total subscriber base. The firm estimates that more than 90% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad-supported tier, representing around 45 million subscriptions.

Prior to the launch of Max, Discovery+ had somewhere in the region of 10 million ad-supported accounts, while HBO Max had around 2 million, Ampere said. It added that Peacock has more than 30 million ad-supported subscribers, the most of any new U.S. OTT service, while Paramount+ has more than 25 million ad-supported subscribers in the U.S.

Ampere believes that hybrid services are “an increasingly important element of streaming service monetization, and hybrid tiers often generate more revenue per subscription than their ad-free counterparts.” It also says that the tiers “represent a way for consumers to maintain a wider array of subscriptions while economic times remain tough.”

Ampere’s latest research comes as earnings season for the major studios is in full swing.

Netflix, which recently eliminated its basic ad-free plan in the United States as it expands its password sharing crackdown, added 5.9 million paid subscribers during the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 238.4 million globally. During its upfront presentation to advertisers in May, Netflix reported that the ad tier had nearly 5 million monthly active users.

Meanwhile, NBCUniversal parent Comcast reported that Peacock had a total of 24 million paid subscribers. The streaming service, which dropped its free tier for new users in January, recently said it would bump up the price for its Premium and Premium Plus tiers to $5.99 and $11.99, respectively, which will take effect on Aug. 17. Due to certain streaming rights and contracts with content providers, some Peacock content still has ads.

Next up on the earnings docket will be Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its Max rebrand on May 23 — which offers a $9.99 per month Max Ad Lite tier, $15.99 per month Max Ad Free tier and $19.99 per month Max Ultimate Ad Free tier.

Meanwhile, Paramount Global, which charges $5.99 per month for its ad-supported option, and Disney, which launched its $7.99 per month ad-supported Disney+ tier in November, will report earnings on Aug. 7 and 9, respectively.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand raising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, encourages savings and makes lending harder, hence discouraging inflation. Cool


But they keep saying that should also make unemployment go up. This part I don't get; if it is costlier to live because of inflation, people will come to work and unemployment stays down. For unemployment to go up, I would assume ( based on these general logics ) that once inflation cools, the unemployment rate may increase as people who have saved up enough can be unemployed, or whatever reason just be unemployed.



Finally, I assume these rates have other things factored in- like the fact the new young people join the workforce every year. And, that since student loan payments were paused, and the average American doesn't just reduce spending, but increases their credit usage more ( when inflation strikes )



My thinking being, Jpow isn't going to unemployment go down because anyone who can afford to be unemployed already is, and no one else will be able to for a while. He said he would keep hiking till he saw uptick in unemployment, didn't he?

370,stocks,"*BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year*

Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 31.07.23, 08:15 AM

Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).

The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.

The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.

At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.

BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.

When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.

In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.

Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.

“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.

**Galloping run**

The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.

”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.

A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).

”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.

In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.

”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.

The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”

**Strategic role**

The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.

Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.

BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.

For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.

Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.

**Tightrope**

Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.

The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.

”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.

Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.

Comparing Kroger to other supermarket chains (like Walmart, Target or Cotsco) make the company seem extremely undervalued. Walmart for example has a PE of almost 40, against Kroger 14, Walmart revenues are 1.5 times its market cap, Kroger's are over 4 times. Similar arguments could be made for other competitors. 

By looking at the company I havent seen many problems either. Revenues are growing, and so are EPS, the debt is decreasing and the margins are quite stable. Operating income has risen a lot and the number of outstanding share has been going down. It really doesn't look bad compared to other companies in the same sector.

The biggest treat I can see is the competition from Whole Food and Amazon Fresh, but their stores aren't necesserely in the same cities, and taking over a grocery gigant like Kroger (2700 stores if I am not wrong) would be a very big task, requiring huge investments and crazy capex.

Bonus for the strong expected economic growth of the USA, especially the states where Kroger is well established, like Texas.

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking at Take Two, Tencent, CD Projekt, Nintendo and Sony that still have room to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic Arts, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard will no doubt have some big hitters but their entry price is already pretty high.&lt;/p&gt;

GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.  


# REVENUE:

I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB's actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I'd assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. ([SOURCE](https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html))  
  
Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.

Taking ComfortDelGro (Traditional Taxi) and Kakao (Superapp) as reference for how much the margins should be for GRAB.

Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB's main business of being a ride hailing app.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

Taxes, GRAB's taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of ""Adjusted EBITDA"" but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring ""One-Time off transaction"" and in turn rewards managements for beating their ""Adjusted EBITDA"". They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don't like the tale the management constantly spins about ""Adjusted EBITDA"", it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.

I’d assume that they ramp up Capital Expenditure for 3 years in line with management’s goal of wanting to fully penetrate into Southeast Asia which has yet to be substantially broken into by the company.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WACC:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;COST OF EQUITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFR (1M Avg) = 3.82%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta = 0.88&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 Earnings Yield (1M Avg) = 4.25%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4050 = (4050 * 4.25%) * (1+16%) / (1+R) + [((4050 * 4.25%) * (1+16%)) * (1+3.82%) / (R - 3.82%)] / (1 + R) ^ 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R = 10.3%, ERP = 6.48%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COE = 9.52%  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;COST OF DEBT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRAB has a bond rating of BB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BB Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 6.92%  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WEIGHTAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOAN Schedule: (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/LkS6vl5""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt = 1400M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share Price (1M Avg) = $3.49&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares O/S = 3968M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market Value of Equity = 13848M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;%Equity = 90.8%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;%Debt = 10.2%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marginal Tax Rate = 17%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WACC = 8.65%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of &amp;quot;Adjusted EBITDA&amp;quot; but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring &amp;quot;One-Time off transaction&amp;quot; and in turn rewards managements for beating their &amp;quot;Adjusted EBITDA&amp;quot;. They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don&amp;#39;t like the tale the management constantly spins about &amp;quot;Adjusted EBITDA&amp;quot;, it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.&lt;/p&gt;

399,stocks,"Let's summarize the reasons why INTC is at the current price:

* \- Lagging behind in technology
* \- Poor track record of management
* \- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history
* \- Losing market share in most segments
* \- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues
* \- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush
* \- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days

&amp;#x200B;

Still, let's underline some facts:

**Market valuation landscape:**

* \- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold.
* \- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.

**Strategy:**

Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:

* \- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)
* \- Catching up to TSMC's tech

They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.

Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**

The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.

If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.

We already have positive things to say about their execution:

* \- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.
* \- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.
* \- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.
* \- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irrational fears:**

* \- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:

Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.

* \- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:

Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you for your points of view, they give me more to think about. After all, my goal is to make the most fair case and orient my thoughts, as I see no good or current publication about this.

*****
&gt; Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.
*****
&gt; Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.
*****
&gt; “Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”
*****
&gt; In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.

I am 33M.  

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.  

I started getting more serious and doing a lot more research in the last year or so and have accepted my losses and sold off my bad investments.  I've now invested in a mix of growth/ETFs like VOO, SCHD, AAPL, and TSLA

I have two others in SPYD (don't ask why) and AUTL (hoping they get acquired) but not a significant amount in either. The rest of the money I just keep as SPAXX in Fidelity 

Lately, I just feel like the ""safest"" and more guaranteed return on investments are CDs and T-Bills given the interest rates they are offering (5% - 5.5%). I am in the process of setting up a CD/T-Bills ladder where I'd have maturing CDs or T-Bills monthly starting later this year. 

Should I continue with this approach? I know the interest rates will fluctuate and may not always be high but I haven't seen any of my investments besides TSLA really take off (AAPL has done decent). As noted above, I actually lost a good amount in the past.  

Right now, my goal is to not think about it everyday and just have my money grow over time (I will not need the cash). Should I just put it all in VOO? Leave it in SPAXX? Or just continue the ladder strategy? Are there any risks I'm not considering?

Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA on Tuesday, pointing to “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,” as well as a growing general debt burden.

Back in May, the agency placed the nation’s AAA rating on negative watch, blaming the debt ceiling fight. At the time, lawmakers in Washington butted heads over an agreement that would keep the federal government from running out of money. President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill on June 2, just days away from the “X-date” on June 5.

The country’s recent debt limit feud was mentioned again in the downgrade.

“In Fitch’s view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025,” the ratings agency said.

“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” Fitch said.

The agency also highlighted the rising general government deficit, which it anticipates will rise to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. “Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending (15% of total federal spending) as agreed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act offer only a modest improvement to the medium-term fiscal outlook,” Fitch said.

The agency also noted that a combination of tightening credit conditions, weakening business investment and a slowdown in consumption could lead the economy into a “mild” recession in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of next year.

This isn’t the first time a rating agency has downgraded the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2011 after Washington managed to avoid a default. At the time, the agency highlighted political risk as part of its reasoning.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Amazon is opening up its Fresh grocery delivery service to people without Prime in select U.S. cities.

415,stocks,"Apple is expected to witness a decline in iPhone sales during the April-June quarter, attributed to cautious consumer behaviour in a slow economy as the launch of a new model is anticipated. As the tech giant prepares to release its earnings report, analysts emphasise the significance of revealing its utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost growth.

Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv.
Specifically, iPhone sales are anticipated to have declined by over 2% during this period, based on a survey of 24 analysts conducted by Visible Alpha. This contrasts with a nearly 3% increase in sales during the same quarter last year and a 1.5% rise in the preceding quarter (January-March).

The upcoming quarterly report may serve as a deviation from the positive earnings trend observed in other prominent tech companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Microsoft. These companies have demonstrated resilience in their cloud-based operations and have witnessed a surge in digital ad sales.
""Apple is not immune to general macroeconomic trends and will continue to set the pace (for the smartphone industry) for quite some time,"" Reuters quoted Bob O'Donnell, founder of TECHnalysis Research, as saying.
In September, analysts anticipate the unveiling of the much-anticipated iPhone 15, which could feature the widely accepted USB-C port on certain models. This development may provide a slight boost to iPhone sales during the July-September quarter, according to market experts, who have differing opinions on the overall performance during this period.

Notably, Apple has a tradition of not providing quarterly outlooks. However, industry analysts speculate that the tech giant might shed light on its utilisation of AI to enhance the upcoming product lineup, offering insights into the company's innovative approach.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is expected to witness a decline in iPhone sales during the April-June quarter, attributed to cautious consumer behaviour in a slow economy as the launch of a new model is anticipated.

# [Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”
*****
&gt; A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.
*****
&gt; “I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.
*****
&gt; CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.

The company's sales climbed by 151.57% between 2013 and 2022, with a 9.66% compound yearly growth rate. Similarly, with a CAGR of 10.81%, its free cash flow increased dramatically by 179.03%. This significant expansion demonstrates BKNG's capacity to increase its market presence and successfully seize commercial opportunities over time.  
BKNG's growth prospects are still bright; during the next five years, double-digit earnings growth is anticipated in all but one year. The corporation is anticipated to keep growing its revenues and operating well in the years to come, according to this optimistic prognosis. Going forward, BKNG's connected journey strategy will be one of the primary growth drivers. This approach is based on personalising the travel experience for each consumer utilising data and technology. According to each person's interests, hotels and activities are suggested, and travel schedules are updated in real time.  
There are some risks involved with investing in BKNG because of their business style. Being a business that focuses on travel, BKNG's success is closely correlated with that of the travel sector. Travel spending may decline during economic downturns, which could have an effect on BKNG's operations. While I still believe in the travel sector's long-term promise, I also recognise that it is vulnerable to unanticipated occurrences like the COVID-19 pandemic, which might once again cause travel to be disrupted.  
Despite these dangers, a number of factors are driving future expansion. Since a few years ago, BKNG has made significant investments in AI technology, further demonstrating their dedication to provide consumers with trips that are more connected and personalised. By using AI to analyse information in several languages and provide personalised recommendations, BKNG hopes to improve relationships with customers and partners.   
While other BKNG brands are working to incorporate this technology into their own offers, others, like KAYAK and OpenTable, are actively experimenting with generative AI plug-ins. BKNG is well-positioned to create an engaging and distinctive booking experience, customised to match the various demands of its consumers, thanks to a solid AI base. By utilising AI, I think BKNG will continue to lead the travel sector, constantly enhancing its offerings to give clients the greatest experience possible while encouraging long-term, significant shareholder development.

Nearly 75% of the S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks were trading above their 200-day moving average, with cyclical sectors seeing the highest percentages among sector peers. International stocks were also participating in the year&amp;#39;s rally, with most major global benchmarks now in bull market territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In midday trading on Monday, the SPDR S&amp;amp;P 500 ETF Trust was flat at $457, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF was unchanged at $354, and the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ+ Free Alerts held steady at $383. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE outperformed, rising 1.9%, while the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund XLV was the laggard, down 1.1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latest economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas&amp;#39;s manufacturing sector general business activity index hit a four-month high of -20.0 in July 2023, marking the second consecutive monthly increase.

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks with Tesla Inc., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and other automakers about supplying them with lithium as the oil giant works to build a business around the crucial battery metal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Exxon is one of several oil and gas companies seeking to expand into lithium production to take advantage of surging demand for use in electric-vehicle batteries, and as a way of diversifying beyond fossil fuels. The talks with potential customers are still early stage, and the company has yet to lay out its plans for potential lithium operations.

The company has also had conversations with battery giants Samsung and SK On Co., the people said, asking not to be named because the information is private. Exxon, SK On and Volkswagen declined to comment. Tesla, Ford and Samsung didn’t reply to messages seeking comment.

The rapid global roll out of electric vehicles has raised the risk of bottlenecks and shortages for key battery materials like lithium, sparking a rush to invest in and secure supply.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html""&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street’s busiest earnings week continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.
*****
&gt; Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.
*****
&gt; More than 160 S&amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.
*****
&gt; To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.
*****
&gt; “We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”
*****
&gt; He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.
*****
&gt; “As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.
*****
&gt; Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.

&lt;p&gt;“We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.&lt;/p&gt;

- 30% YTD: 75

Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by $2.7 billion, up 26% during the second quarter to $12.7 billion at quarterend, and over 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are from direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the second quarter, the median FICO score was 747. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans. Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. SoFi Bank, N.A. generated $63.1 million of GAAP net income at a 17% margin.”

SoFi continues to thrive in this macro environment:

* Galileo, Technisys, and bank charter form the pillars for SoFi to become ""The AWS of Fintech""
* The acquisition of Wyndham Capital on April 3rd completes the three arms of lending under one umbrella. This cut off the middleman fee and maximizes profitability for the most lucrative segment of SoFi's businesses.
* The wide diversity of SoFi business allows it to thrive in any macro environment.
* SoFi's Savings with direct deposit APY of 4.4% gives an extra push for deposit growth in subsequent quarters.

More than 1 million Netflix accounts and around 800,000 Disney+ subscribers in the U.S. are on ad-supported tiers, according to Ampere, representing nearly 2% of each service’s total subscriber base. The firm estimates that more than 90% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad-supported tier, representing around 45 million subscriptions.

Prior to the launch of Max, Discovery+ had somewhere in the region of 10 million ad-supported accounts, while HBO Max had around 2 million, Ampere said. It added that Peacock has more than 30 million ad-supported subscribers, the most of any new U.S. OTT service, while Paramount+ has more than 25 million ad-supported subscribers in the U.S.

Ampere believes that hybrid services are “an increasingly important element of streaming service monetization, and hybrid tiers often generate more revenue per subscription than their ad-free counterparts.” It also says that the tiers “represent a way for consumers to maintain a wider array of subscriptions while economic times remain tough.”

Ampere’s latest research comes as earnings season for the major studios is in full swing.

Netflix, which recently eliminated its basic ad-free plan in the United States as it expands its password sharing crackdown, added 5.9 million paid subscribers during the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 238.4 million globally. During its upfront presentation to advertisers in May, Netflix reported that the ad tier had nearly 5 million monthly active users.

Meanwhile, NBCUniversal parent Comcast reported that Peacock had a total of 24 million paid subscribers. The streaming service, which dropped its free tier for new users in January, recently said it would bump up the price for its Premium and Premium Plus tiers to $5.99 and $11.99, respectively, which will take effect on Aug. 17. Due to certain streaming rights and contracts with content providers, some Peacock content still has ads.

Next up on the earnings docket will be Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its Max rebrand on May 23 — which offers a $9.99 per month Max Ad Lite tier, $15.99 per month Max Ad Free tier and $19.99 per month Max Ultimate Ad Free tier.

470,stocks,"*BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year*

Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 31.07.23, 08:15 AM

Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).

The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.

The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.

At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.

BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.

When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.

In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.

Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.

“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.

**Galloping run**

The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.

”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.

A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).

”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.

In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.

”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.

The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”

**Strategic role**

The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.

Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.

BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.

For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.

Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.

**Tightrope**

Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.

The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.

”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.

Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galloping run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightrope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the past couple of years I have been persuaded that aliens not only exist (I feel like most rational people already believe this), but that we have been visited by intelligent life. I think powerful institutions know this, and I agree with the sentiment of others that they are in the process of slowly bestowing this knowledge upon us. Furthermore, I think their timeframe for divulgence is capped: nowadays, the average person has far better equipment on them to capture an inexplicable phenomena than they did in Roswell times. This is only getting better and at some point the decision to divulge may be out of the hands of powerful institutions.  
With this in mind, my personal opinion is that in the next 5-10 years aliens will be revealed to exist and have visited earth. I suspect that the news will not coincidence with any warnings of existential threat, and that governments will play ignorant (they might be anyways) as to who/what these beings are. Still, this would be be major, major news. This knowledge would fundamentally alter humanity's perception of itself and the cosmos. It would captivate the world's attention, leading to a mixture of awe, fear, and excitement… markets have been moved by less.

Let's say a stock is $10.00, and you buy 100 shares. You now sell 1 contract (100 shares) at a strike price of $12.00 for $0.50 each ($50 contract).

Am I understanding how selling covered calls work, in that the following are the possible outcomes?

1. **Share price rises to strike price ($12)** \- You make $200.00 from the stock increasing, plus $50 for the sale of the contract. You are obligated to sell 100 shares for $12.00 each to the buyer. Your net profit is $250.00.
2. **Price goes way up, (example, share price increase to $50.00)** \- You make $200.00 from the stock increasing, but you don't profit any further than your strike price. Also, $5 for the sale of the contract. You are obligated to sell your 100 shares for $12.00 each to the buyer. Your net profit is $250.00.
3. **Price goes down (example, share price decrease to $8.00)** \- You lose $200 from the stock decreasing. You gain $50.00 from the sale of the contract. Net loss - $150

GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.  


# REVENUE:

I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB's actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I'd assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. ([SOURCE](https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html))  
  
Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.

Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB's main business of being a ride hailing app.

Taxes, GRAB's taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of ""Adjusted EBITDA"" but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring ""One-Time off transaction"" and in turn rewards managements for beating their ""Adjusted EBITDA"". They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don't like the tale the management constantly spins about ""Adjusted EBITDA"", it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.

* \- Lagging behind in technology
* \- Poor track record of management
* \- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history
* \- Losing market share in most segments
* \- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues
* \- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush
* \- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days

&amp;#x200B;

Still, let's underline some facts:

**Market valuation landscape:**

* \- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold.
* \- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.

**Strategy:**

Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:

* \- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)
* \- Catching up to TSMC's tech

They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.

Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**

The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.

If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.

We already have positive things to say about their execution:

* \- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.
* \- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.
* \- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.
* \- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irrational fears:**

* \- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:

Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.

* \- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:

Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.

EDIT: Thank you for your points of view, they give me more to think about. After all, my goal is to make the most fair case and orient my thoughts, as I see no good or current publication about this.

&lt;p&gt;Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Catching up to TSMC&amp;#39;s tech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn&amp;#39;t worry too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have positive things to say about their execution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irrational fears:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, it&amp;#39;s one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it&amp;#39;s a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatable, but it&amp;#39;s not wise to make decisions on these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn&amp;#39;t look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thank you for your points of view, they give me more to think about. After all, my goal is to make the most fair case and orient my thoughts, as I see no good or current publication about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

*****
&gt; Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.
*****
&gt; Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.
*****
&gt; “Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”
*****
&gt; In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Thursday, August 3rd, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Thursday, August the 3rd, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall after U.S. downgrade spurs a sell-off, traders scrutinize latest earnings: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures tied to the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I am 33M.  

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.  

I started getting more serious and doing a lot more research in the last year or so and have accepted my losses and sold off my bad investments.  I've now invested in a mix of growth/ETFs like VOO, SCHD, AAPL, and TSLA

I have two others in SPYD (don't ask why) and AUTL (hoping they get acquired) but not a significant amount in either. The rest of the money I just keep as SPAXX in Fidelity 

Lately, I just feel like the ""safest"" and more guaranteed return on investments are CDs and T-Bills given the interest rates they are offering (5% - 5.5%). I am in the process of setting up a CD/T-Bills ladder where I'd have maturing CDs or T-Bills monthly starting later this year. 

Should I continue with this approach? I know the interest rates will fluctuate and may not always be high but I haven't seen any of my investments besides TSLA really take off (AAPL has done decent). As noted above, I actually lost a good amount in the past.  

Right now, my goal is to not think about it everyday and just have my money grow over time (I will not need the cash). Should I just put it all in VOO? Leave it in SPAXX? Or just continue the ladder strategy? Are there any risks I'm not considering?

I also have some money just sitting in Robinhood, which earns me 4.9% APY (with gold). Most of it is in Fidelity.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;

Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA on Tuesday, pointing to “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,” as well as a growing general debt burden.

Back in May, the agency placed the nation’s AAA rating on negative watch, blaming the debt ceiling fight. At the time, lawmakers in Washington butted heads over an agreement that would keep the federal government from running out of money. President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill on June 2, just days away from the “X-date” on June 5.

The country’s recent debt limit feud was mentioned again in the downgrade.

“In Fitch’s view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025,” the ratings agency said.

“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” Fitch said.

The agency also highlighted the rising general government deficit, which it anticipates will rise to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. “Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending (15% of total federal spending) as agreed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act offer only a modest improvement to the medium-term fiscal outlook,” Fitch said.

The agency also noted that a combination of tightening credit conditions, weakening business investment and a slowdown in consumption could lead the economy into a “mild” recession in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of next year.

This isn’t the first time a rating agency has downgraded the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2011 after Washington managed to avoid a default. At the time, the agency highlighted political risk as part of its reasoning.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As the tech giant prepares to release its earnings report, analysts emphasise the significance of revealing its utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost growth.

Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv.

# [Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”
*****
&gt; A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.
*****
&gt; “I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.
*****
&gt; CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Wednesday, August 2nd, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Wednesday, August the 2nd, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The company released its second-quarter financial results on Thursday. The U.S.-based automaker's EV division, called ""Ford Model e,"" has lost $1.8 billion so far this year, according to Fortune.

The projected $4.5 billion loss is over twice as much as Model e's $2.1 billion loss in 2022. The company recently announced that the price of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks will be reduced due to cheaper raw battery materials.

The company touted that its low EV prices ""establish[es] leadership ahead of industry’s next-generation EVs"" and that the Ford Model e's revenue is up 39%. Ford is also expected to produce 600,000 EVs per year by 2024.

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks with Tesla Inc., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and other automakers about supplying them with lithium as the oil giant works to build a business around the crucial battery metal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Exxon is one of several oil and gas companies seeking to expand into lithium production to take advantage of surging demand for use in electric-vehicle batteries, and as a way of diversifying beyond fossil fuels. The talks with potential customers are still early stage, and the company has yet to lay out its plans for potential lithium operations. However, the discussions are the latest sign of Exxon’s growing interest in the lithium business.

The company has also had conversations with battery giants Samsung and SK On Co., the people said, asking not to be named because the information is private. Exxon, SK On and Volkswagen declined to comment. Tesla, Ford and Samsung didn’t reply to messages seeking comment.

The rapid global roll out of electric vehicles has raised the risk of bottlenecks and shortages for key battery materials like lithium, sparking a rush to invest in and secure supply.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.
[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html""&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year&amp;#39;s biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market&amp;#39;s rally through May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year&amp;#39;s biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market&amp;#39;s rally through May.
[Money doesn&amp;#39;t grow on trees]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;amp;P 500 (&lt;sup&gt;GSPC)&lt;/sup&gt; logging gains between June and July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while the aforementioned stars of this year&amp;#39;s rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we&amp;#39;ve been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broadening of the market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street’s busiest earnings week continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.
*****
&gt; Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.
*****
&gt; More than 160 S&amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.
*****
&gt; To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.
*****
&gt; “We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”
*****
&gt; He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.
*****
&gt; “As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.
*****
&gt; Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.

[This website lists the YTD price performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance), so not including dividends.

- 30% YTD: 75
- 40% YTD: 47
- 50% YTD: 27
- 60% YTD: 15

Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by $2.7 billion, up 26% during the second quarter to $12.7 billion at quarterend, and over 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are from direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the second quarter, the median FICO score was 747. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans. Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. SoFi Bank, N.A. generated $63.1 million of GAAP net income at a 17% margin.”

SoFi continues to thrive in this macro environment:

* Galileo, Technisys, and bank charter form the pillars for SoFi to become ""The AWS of Fintech""
* The acquisition of Wyndham Capital on April 3rd completes the three arms of lending under one umbrella. This cut off the middleman fee and maximizes profitability for the most lucrative segment of SoFi's businesses.
* The wide diversity of SoFi business allows it to thrive in any macro environment.

562,stocks,"I was wondering if anyone is holding NTDOF and wanted to post info about the dividend yield and ADR Fees?  I was sort of curious is it better long term to hold NTDOY and NDTOF and find it hard to compare the ""cost structure"".

I had a few shares of NTDOY recently on a dividend payout with this cost structure info

1 share NTDOY (currently trades $11.28) is 1/4th of Nintendo 7974.T stock  
Dividend declared 123 yen/share or 30.75 yen/NTDOY   
Dividend received in US account on July 11th when yen to dollar was 140.27yen/dollar  
Dividend I received of $0.214 per NTDOY after-foreign taxes withheld and conversion to the dollar  
This means 0.214 was received when the conversion would be 0.219 so approx -3% to taxes  
ADR maintenance fee charged after the dividend of $0.0299 / share meaning $0.1841 received  


Final net of 0.1841/share on estimated 0.219 payout is 84% efficiency or in other words -16% of the dividend payout goes to foreign taxes and also ADR fees before US taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a similar experience seeing about 16% of the yield value go out the door to ADR?  While I like NTDOY, I was curious if NTDOF has a lower fee in the end, was wondering if anyone is holding it and wants to look at it and compare? 

The ADRS trade at the same relative price adjusting for share % but in my view if one has significantly lower fees it would be a better buy.

565,stocks,"Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.

More than 1 million Netflix accounts and around 800,000 Disney+ subscribers in the U.S. are on ad-supported tiers, according to Ampere, representing nearly 2% of each service’s total subscriber base. The firm estimates that more than 90% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad-supported tier, representing around 45 million subscriptions.

Prior to the launch of Max, Discovery+ had somewhere in the region of 10 million ad-supported accounts, while HBO Max had around 2 million, Ampere said. It added that Peacock has more than 30 million ad-supported subscribers, the most of any new U.S. OTT service, while Paramount+ has more than 25 million ad-supported subscribers in the U.S.

Ampere believes that hybrid services are “an increasingly important element of streaming service monetization, and hybrid tiers often generate more revenue per subscription than their ad-free counterparts.” It also says that the tiers “represent a way for consumers to maintain a wider array of subscriptions while economic times remain tough.”

Ampere’s latest research comes as earnings season for the major studios is in full swing.

Netflix, which recently eliminated its basic ad-free plan in the United States as it expands its password sharing crackdown, added 5.9 million paid subscribers during the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 238.4 million globally. During its upfront presentation to advertisers in May, Netflix reported that the ad tier had nearly 5 million monthly active users.

Meanwhile, NBCUniversal parent Comcast reported that Peacock had a total of 24 million paid subscribers. The streaming service, which dropped its free tier for new users in January, recently said it would bump up the price for its Premium and Premium Plus tiers to $5.99 and $11.99, respectively, which will take effect on Aug. 17. Due to certain streaming rights and contracts with content providers, some Peacock content still has ads.

Next up on the earnings docket will be Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its Max rebrand on May 23 — which offers a $9.99 per month Max Ad Lite tier, $15.99 per month Max Ad Free tier and $19.99 per month Max Ultimate Ad Free tier.

Meanwhile, Paramount Global, which charges $5.99 per month for its ad-supported option, and Disney, which launched its $7.99 per month ad-supported Disney+ tier in November, will report earnings on Aug. 7 and 9, respectively.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, NBCUniversal parent Comcast reported that Peacock had a total of 24 million paid subscribers. The streaming service, which dropped its free tier for new users in January, recently said it would bump up the price for its Premium and Premium Plus tiers to $5.99 and $11.99, respectively, which will take effect on Aug. 17. Due to certain streaming rights and contracts with content providers, some Peacock content still has ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up on the earnings docket will be Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its Max rebrand on May 23 — which offers a $9.99 per month Max Ad Lite tier, $15.99 per month Max Ad Free tier and $19.99 per month Max Ultimate Ad Free tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Paramount Global, which charges $5.99 per month for its ad-supported option, and Disney, which launched its $7.99 per month ad-supported Disney+ tier in November, will report earnings on Aug. 7 and 9, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand raising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, encourages savings and makes lending harder, hence discouraging inflation. Cool

For unemployment to go up, I would assume ( based on these general logics ) that once inflation cools, the unemployment rate may increase as people who have saved up enough can be unemployed, or whatever reason just be unemployed.

570,stocks,"*BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year*

Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 31.07.23, 08:15 AM

Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).

The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.

The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.

At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.

BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.

When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.

In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.

Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.

“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.

**Galloping run**

The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.

”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.

A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).

”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.

In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.

”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.

The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”

**Strategic role**

The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.

Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.

BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.

For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.

Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.

**Tightrope**

Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.

The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.

”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.

Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.

Comparing Kroger to other supermarket chains (like Walmart, Target or Cotsco) make the company seem extremely undervalued.

The biggest treat I can see is the competition from Whole Food and Amazon Fresh, but their stores aren't necesserely in the same cities, and taking over a grocery gigant like Kroger (2700 stores if I am not wrong) would be a very big task, requiring huge investments and crazy capex.

Am I understanding how selling covered calls work, in that the following are the possible outcomes?

1. **Share price rises to strike price ($12)** \- You make $200.00 from the stock increasing, plus $50 for the sale of the contract. You are obligated to sell 100 shares for $12.00 each to the buyer. Your net profit is $250.00.
2. **Price goes way up, (example, share price increase to $50.00)** \- You make $200.00 from the stock increasing, but you don't profit any further than your strike price. Also, $5 for the sale of the contract. You are obligated to sell your 100 shares for $12.00 each to the buyer. Your net profit is $250.00.
3. **Price goes down (example, share price decrease to $8.00)** \- You lose $200 from the stock decreasing. You gain $50.00 from the sale of the contract. Net loss - $150

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price goes down (example, share price decrease to $8.00)&lt;/strong&gt; - You lose $200 from the stock decreasing. You gain $50.00 from the sale of the contract. Net loss - $150&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

597,stocks,"# INTRODUCTION:

GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.  


# REVENUE:

I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB's actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I'd assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. ([SOURCE](https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html))  
  
Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.  
  
REVENUE MODEL: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/q1x5t39))  


# COST:

A cost breakdown of GRAB as of FY22 is 94.6% Incentive given to drivers, 19.5% Marketing, 45.1% G&amp;A, 32.5% R&amp;D. The percentage adds to more than 100% because GRAB is losing money.   
  
  
Taking ComfortDelGro (Traditional Taxi) and Kakao (Superapp) as reference for how much the margins should be for GRAB.  
Kakao’s EBIT margins for FY21 and 22 is 9.7% and 8.2% respectively.  
“ComfortDelGro’s taxi earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin is…15.6% in 2019” ([SOURCE](https://sbr.com.sg/transport-logistics/news/comfortdelgro-taxis-profit-margin-shrinks-2-in-2020-maybank-kim-eng))  
Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB's main business of being a ride hailing app.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

Taxes, GRAB's taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%. GRAB is based on the Cayman islands, but it does not seem possible for them to avoid taxes and since most of their business operations are done in Southeast Asia, I’d assume they will eventually move to Singapore and pay Singapore taxes.  
  
NOLs, I assume that GRAB will turn profitable in 2027. Breakdown of NOL expiry dates ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/zurV11L)), Under the assumption that during the period of my forecast, no more NOLs are added. Unutilized NOLs as of 2022 are 3275M. Taking into account the time factor, NOLs are 2163M.  
  
Employee stock options, ESOs breakdown([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/d01avGW)) Using the treasury stock method, 19.9M stocks are added.  
  
Time to profit, It took KakaoTAXI 3 years to break even([SOURCE](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kakao-southkorea-idUSKCN1GP11O)). Because Kakao had already been a large player when they entered the ride sharing business and had been previously profitable, the market conditions are drastically different. I’d assume that GRAB takes about 7 years from the first year they started reporting their financials.  


Change in NWC, Opting for less granularity I'd assume that the day turnovers are average of historical data and assumed constant throughout  
Change in NWC Schedule: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/qLZNJs6))  
  
CapEX and D&amp;A, GRAB have been Net negative CapEX from 2019 - 2022. I’d assume that they ramp up Capital Expenditure for 3 years in line with management’s goal of wanting to fully penetrate into Southeast Asia which has yet to be substantially broken into by the company.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of ""Adjusted EBITDA"" but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring ""One-Time off transaction"" and in turn rewards managements for beating their ""Adjusted EBITDA"". They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don't like the tale the management constantly spins about ""Adjusted EBITDA"", it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;INTRODUCTION:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;REVENUE:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB&amp;#39;s actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I&amp;#39;d assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. (&lt;a href=""https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REVENUE MODEL: (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/q1x5t39""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;COST:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cost breakdown of GRAB as of FY22 is 94.6% Incentive given to drivers, 19.5% Marketing, 45.1% G&amp;amp;A, 32.5% R&amp;amp;D. The percentage adds to more than 100% because GRAB is losing money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking ComfortDelGro (Traditional Taxi) and Kakao (Superapp) as reference for how much the margins should be for GRAB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kakao’s EBIT margins for FY21 and 22 is 9.7% and 8.2% respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ComfortDelGro’s taxi earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin is…15.6% in 2019” (&lt;a href=""https://sbr.com.sg/transport-logistics/news/comfortdelgro-taxis-profit-margin-shrinks-2-in-2020-maybank-kim-eng""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB&amp;#39;s main business of being a ride hailing app.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ASSUMPTIONS:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxes, GRAB&amp;#39;s taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%. GRAB is based on the Cayman islands, but it does not seem possible for them to avoid taxes and since most of their business operations are done in Southeast Asia, I’d assume they will eventually move to Singapore and pay Singapore taxes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOLs, I assume that GRAB will turn profitable in 2027. Breakdown of NOL expiry dates (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/zurV11L""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;), Under the assumption that during the period of my forecast, no more NOLs are added. Unutilized NOLs as of 2022 are 3275M. Taking into account the time factor, NOLs are 2163M.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employee stock options, ESOs breakdown(&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/d01avGW""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;) Using the treasury stock method, 19.9M stocks are added.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to profit, It took KakaoTAXI 3 years to break even(&lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kakao-southkorea-idUSKCN1GP11O""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;). Because Kakao had already been a large player when they entered the ride sharing business and had been previously profitable, the market conditions are drastically different. I’d assume that GRAB takes about 7 years from the first year they started reporting their financials.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change in NWC, Opting for less granularity I&amp;#39;d assume that the day turnovers are average of historical data and assumed constant throughout&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change in NWC Schedule: (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/qLZNJs6""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CapEX and D&amp;amp;A, GRAB have been Net negative CapEX from 2019 - 2022. I’d assume that they ramp up Capital Expenditure for 3 years in line with management’s goal of wanting to fully penetrate into Southeast Asia which has yet to be substantially broken into by the company.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WACC:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;COST OF EQUITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFR (1M Avg) = 3.82%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta = 0.88&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 Earnings Yield (1M Avg) = 4.25%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4050 = (4050 * 4.25%) * (1+16%) / (1+R) + [((4050 * 4.25%) * (1+16%)) * (1+3.82%) / (R - 3.82%)] / (1 + R) ^ 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R = 10.3%, ERP = 6.48%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COE = 9.52%  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;COST OF DEBT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRAB has a bond rating of BB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BB Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 6.92%  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WEIGHTAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share Price (1M Avg) = $3.49&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares O/S = 3968M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market Value of Equity = 13848M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;%Equity = 90.8%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;%Debt = 10.2%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marginal Tax Rate = 17%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WACC = 8.65%&lt;/p&gt;

* \- Lagging behind in technology
* \- Poor track record of management
* \- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history
* \- Losing market share in most segments
* \- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues
* \- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush
* \- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days

&amp;#x200B;

Still, let's underline some facts:

**Market valuation landscape:**

* \- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold.
* \- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.

**Strategy:**

Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:

* \- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)
* \- Catching up to TSMC's tech

They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.

Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**

The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.

If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.

We already have positive things to say about their execution:

* \- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.
* \- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.
* \- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.
* \- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irrational fears:**

* \- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:

Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.

* \- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:

Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.

*****
&gt; Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.
*****
&gt; Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.
*****
&gt; “Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”
*****
&gt; In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.

I am 33M.  

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.  

I started getting more serious and doing a lot more research in the last year or so and have accepted my losses and sold off my bad investments.  I've now invested in a mix of growth/ETFs like VOO, SCHD, AAPL, and TSLA

I have two others in SPYD (don't ask why) and AUTL (hoping they get acquired) but not a significant amount in either. The rest of the money I just keep as SPAXX in Fidelity 

Lately, I just feel like the ""safest"" and more guaranteed return on investments are CDs and T-Bills given the interest rates they are offering (5% - 5.5%). I am in the process of setting up a CD/T-Bills ladder where I'd have maturing CDs or T-Bills monthly starting later this year. 

Should I continue with this approach? I know the interest rates will fluctuate and may not always be high but I haven't seen any of my investments besides TSLA really take off (AAPL has done decent). As noted above, I actually lost a good amount in the past.  

Right now, my goal is to not think about it everyday and just have my money grow over time (I will not need the cash). Should I just put it all in VOO? Leave it in SPAXX? Or just continue the ladder strategy? Are there any risks I'm not considering?

Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA on Tuesday, pointing to “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,” as well as a growing general debt burden.

Back in May, the agency placed the nation’s AAA rating on negative watch, blaming the debt ceiling fight. At the time, lawmakers in Washington butted heads over an agreement that would keep the federal government from running out of money. President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill on June 2, just days away from the “X-date” on June 5.

The country’s recent debt limit feud was mentioned again in the downgrade.

“In Fitch’s view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025,” the ratings agency said.

“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” Fitch said.

The agency also highlighted the rising general government deficit, which it anticipates will rise to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. “Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending (15% of total federal spending) as agreed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act offer only a modest improvement to the medium-term fiscal outlook,” Fitch said.

The agency also noted that a combination of tightening credit conditions, weakening business investment and a slowdown in consumption could lead the economy into a “mild” recession in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of next year.

This isn’t the first time a rating agency has downgraded the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2011 after Washington managed to avoid a default. At the time, the agency highlighted political risk as part of its reasoning.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Amazon is opening up its Fresh grocery delivery service to people without Prime in select U.S. cities.

Amazon will charge non-Prime members $13.95 for deliveries under $50, while orders between $50 and $100 will incur a $10.95 fee, and orders over $100 will carry a $7.95 delivery fee.

# [Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”
*****
&gt; A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.
*****
&gt; “I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.
*****
&gt; CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norwegian Cruise Line&lt;/strong&gt; — The stock fell 3.2% in premarket trading after the company posted its earnings results on Tuesday, which indicated weaker-than-expected guidance for the third quarter. The cruise ship operator topped Wall Street’s estimates, however. On Wednesday, Susquehanna downgraded its rating on Norwegian shares to neutral from positive. It maintained its price target of $17, which suggests a 12.4% downside from Tuesday’s close.&lt;/p&gt;

I know I need to get bonds as I have basically none of them and that seems to be something a well rounded portfolio should have, but I&amp;#39;m not really sure what to go for for those, and beyond that, I&amp;#39;m not sure what other areas need addressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, it was suggested to me that I just dump it all into VT/VTI and call it a day.&lt;br/&gt;

This significant expansion demonstrates BKNG's capacity to increase its market presence and successfully seize commercial opportunities over time.  
BKNG's growth prospects are still bright; during the next five years, double-digit earnings growth is anticipated in all but one year. The corporation is anticipated to keep growing its revenues and operating well in the years to come, according to this optimistic prognosis. Going forward, BKNG's connected journey strategy will be one of the primary growth drivers. This approach is based on personalising the travel experience for each consumer utilising data and technology. According to each person's interests, hotels and activities are suggested, and travel schedules are updated in real time.  
There are some risks involved with investing in BKNG because of their business style. Being a business that focuses on travel, BKNG's success is closely correlated with that of the travel sector. Travel spending may decline during economic downturns, which could have an effect on BKNG's operations. While I still believe in the travel sector's long-term promise, I also recognise that it is vulnerable to unanticipated occurrences like the COVID-19 pandemic, which might once again cause travel to be disrupted.  
Despite these dangers, a number of factors are driving future expansion. Since a few years ago, BKNG has made significant investments in AI technology, further demonstrating their dedication to provide consumers with trips that are more connected and personalised. By using AI to analyse information in several languages and provide personalised recommendations, BKNG hopes to improve relationships with customers and partners.   
While other BKNG brands are working to incorporate this technology into their own offers, others, like KAYAK and OpenTable, are actively experimenting with generative AI plug-ins. BKNG is well-positioned to create an engaging and distinctive booking experience, customised to match the various demands of its consumers, thanks to a solid AI base. By utilising AI, I think BKNG will continue to lead the travel sector, constantly enhancing its offerings to give clients the greatest experience possible while encouraging long-term, significant shareholder development.

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks with Tesla Inc., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and other automakers about supplying them with lithium as the oil giant works to build a business around the crucial battery metal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Exxon is one of several oil and gas companies seeking to expand into lithium production to take advantage of surging demand for use in electric-vehicle batteries, and as a way of diversifying beyond fossil fuels. The talks with potential customers are still early stage, and the company has yet to lay out its plans for potential lithium operations. However, the discussions are the latest sign of Exxon’s growing interest in the lithium business.

The company has also had conversations with battery giants Samsung and SK On Co., the people said, asking not to be named because the information is private. Exxon, SK On and Volkswagen declined to comment. Tesla, Ford and Samsung didn’t reply to messages seeking comment.

The rapid global roll out of electric vehicles has raised the risk of bottlenecks and shortages for key battery materials like lithium, sparking a rush to invest in and secure supply. The world will need nearly 60 new lithium mines and plants to feed the growing demand for the shift away from fossil fuels, according to researcher Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, and more lithium will be required in 2030 than was mined between 2015 and 2022.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/exxon-in-talks-with-tesla-ford-volkswagen-on-supplying-lithium?leadSource=uverify%20wall""&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/exxon-in-talks-with-tesla-ford-volkswagen-on-supplying-lithium?leadSource=uverify%20wall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.
[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, August 1st, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading month of August and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Tuesday, August the 1st, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall as Wall Street’s busiest earnings week continues: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 160 S&amp;amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively.

[This website lists the YTD price performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance), so not including dividends.

Number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 over ___ YTD:

- 20% YTD: 128
- 30% YTD: 75
- 40% YTD: 47
- 50% YTD: 27
- 60% YTD: 15

About 172 stocks have a possibly negative YTD price return (again, excluding dividends). 328 are positive YTD.

Upshot: No, this is not a rally being driven by 7 stocks anymore. All sectors are starting to catch a bid, especially ones beaten down in 2023 like energy and financials. Even as Europe and China teeter on recession, we're seeing international stocks also rally.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still think this is an &amp;#39;isolated&amp;#39;, low-breadth rally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance""&gt;This website lists the YTD price performance of stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt;, so not including dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500 over ___ YTD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% YTD: 128&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30% YTD: 75&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40% YTD: 47&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50% YTD: 27&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60% YTD: 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 172 stocks have a possibly negative YTD price return (again, excluding dividends). 328 are positive YTD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upshot: No, this is not a rally being driven by 7 stocks anymore. All sectors are starting to catch a bid, especially ones beaten down in 2023 like energy and financials. Even as Europe and China teeter on recession, we&amp;#39;re seeing international stocks also rally.&lt;/p&gt;

For the full year 2023, management expects adjusted net revenue of $1.974 to $2.034 billion, up from its prior guidance of $1.955 to $2.02 billion, and full-year adjusted EBITDA of $333 to $343 million, up from its prior guidance of $268 to $288 million, representing a 40-44% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin. Management projects that a more significant portion of the second half adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA results will be generated during the fourth quarter. As the company moves toward expected GAAP net income profitability in the fourth quarter, management expects share-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses to be slightly higher than reported second quarter 2023 levels in both the third and fourth quarters of the year.""

Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by $2.7 billion, up 26% during the second quarter to $12.7 billion at quarterend, and over 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are from direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the second quarter, the median FICO score was 747. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans. Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. SoFi Bank, N.A. generated $63.1 million of GAAP net income at a 17% margin.”

SoFi continues to thrive in this macro environment:

* Galileo, Technisys, and bank charter form the pillars for SoFi to become ""The AWS of Fintech""
* The acquisition of Wyndham Capital on April 3rd completes the three arms of lending under one umbrella. This cut off the middleman fee and maximizes profitability for the most lucrative segment of SoFi's businesses.
* The wide diversity of SoFi business allows it to thrive in any macro environment.
* SoFi's Savings with direct deposit APY of 4.4% gives an extra push for deposit growth in subsequent quarters.
* SoFi Checking and Savings Offers Access to Up to $2 Million in FDIC Insurance ensuring depositors that their money above $250K won't go up in smoke.

662,stocks,"I was wondering if anyone is holding NTDOF and wanted to post info about the dividend yield and ADR Fees?  I was sort of curious is it better long term to hold NTDOY and NDTOF and find it hard to compare the ""cost structure"".

I had a few shares of NTDOY recently on a dividend payout with this cost structure info

1 share NTDOY (currently trades $11.28) is 1/4th of Nintendo 7974.T stock  
Dividend declared 123 yen/share or 30.75 yen/NTDOY   
Dividend received in US account on July 11th when yen to dollar was 140.27yen/dollar  
Dividend I received of $0.214 per NTDOY after-foreign taxes withheld and conversion to the dollar  
This means 0.214 was received when the conversion would be 0.219 so approx -3% to taxes  
ADR maintenance fee charged after the dividend of $0.0299 / share meaning $0.1841 received  


Final net of 0.1841/share on estimated 0.219 payout is 84% efficiency or in other words -16% of the dividend payout goes to foreign taxes and also ADR fees before US taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a similar experience seeing about 16% of the yield value go out the door to ADR?  While I like NTDOY, I was curious if NTDOF has a lower fee in the end, was wondering if anyone is holding it and wants to look at it and compare? 

The ADRS trade at the same relative price adjusting for share % but in my view if one has significantly lower fees it would be a better buy.

665,stocks,"Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.

More than 1 million Netflix accounts and around 800,000 Disney+ subscribers in the U.S. are on ad-supported tiers, according to Ampere, representing nearly 2% of each service’s total subscriber base. The firm estimates that more than 90% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad-supported tier, representing around 45 million subscriptions.

Prior to the launch of Max, Discovery+ had somewhere in the region of 10 million ad-supported accounts, while HBO Max had around 2 million, Ampere said. It added that Peacock has more than 30 million ad-supported subscribers, the most of any new U.S. OTT service, while Paramount+ has more than 25 million ad-supported subscribers in the U.S.

Ampere believes that hybrid services are “an increasingly important element of streaming service monetization, and hybrid tiers often generate more revenue per subscription than their ad-free counterparts.” It also says that the tiers “represent a way for consumers to maintain a wider array of subscriptions while economic times remain tough.”

Ampere’s latest research comes as earnings season for the major studios is in full swing.

Netflix, which recently eliminated its basic ad-free plan in the United States as it expands its password sharing crackdown, added 5.9 million paid subscribers during the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 238.4 million globally. During its upfront presentation to advertisers in May, Netflix reported that the ad tier had nearly 5 million monthly active users.

Meanwhile, NBCUniversal parent Comcast reported that Peacock had a total of 24 million paid subscribers. The streaming service, which dropped its free tier for new users in January, recently said it would bump up the price for its Premium and Premium Plus tiers to $5.99 and $11.99, respectively, which will take effect on Aug. 17. Due to certain streaming rights and contracts with content providers, some Peacock content still has ads.

Next up on the earnings docket will be Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its Max rebrand on May 23 — which offers a $9.99 per month Max Ad Lite tier, $15.99 per month Max Ad Free tier and $19.99 per month Max Ultimate Ad Free tier.

Meanwhile, Paramount Global, which charges $5.99 per month for its ad-supported option, and Disney, which launched its $7.99 per month ad-supported Disney+ tier in November, will report earnings on Aug. 7 and 9, respectively.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand raising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, encourages savings and makes lending harder, hence discouraging inflation. Cool


But they keep saying that should also make unemployment go up. This part I don't get; if it is costlier to live because of inflation, people will come to work and unemployment stays down. For unemployment to go up, I would assume ( based on these general logics ) that once inflation cools, the unemployment rate may increase as people who have saved up enough can be unemployed, or whatever reason just be unemployed.



Finally, I assume these rates have other things factored in- like the fact the new young people join the workforce every year. And, that since student loan payments were paused, and the average American doesn't just reduce spending, but increases their credit usage more ( when inflation strikes )

Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).

The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.

The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.

At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.

BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.

When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.

In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.

Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.

“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.

**Galloping run**

The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.

”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.

A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).

”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.

In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.

”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.

The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”

**Strategic role**

The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.

Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.

BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.

For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.

Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.

**Tightrope**

Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.

The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.

”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.

Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.

Comparing Kroger to other supermarket chains (like Walmart, Target or Cotsco) make the company seem extremely undervalued. Walmart for example has a PE of almost 40, against Kroger 14, Walmart revenues are 1.5 times its market cap, Kroger's are over 4 times. Similar arguments could be made for other competitors. 

By looking at the company I havent seen many problems either. Revenues are growing, and so are EPS, the debt is decreasing and the margins are quite stable. Operating income has risen a lot and the number of outstanding share has been going down. It really doesn't look bad compared to other companies in the same sector.

The biggest treat I can see is the competition from Whole Food and Amazon Fresh, but their stores aren't necesserely in the same cities, and taking over a grocery gigant like Kroger (2700 stores if I am not wrong) would be a very big task, requiring huge investments and crazy capex.

Bonus for the strong expected economic growth of the USA, especially the states where Kroger is well established, like Texas.

I'm a ""put your money where your mouth is"" type guy.

3. **Price goes down (example, share price decrease to $8.00)** \- You lose $200 from the stock decreasing. You gain $50.00 from the sale of the contract. Net loss - $150

GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.  


# REVENUE:

I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB's actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I'd assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. ([SOURCE](https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html))  
  
Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.

Taking ComfortDelGro (Traditional Taxi) and Kakao (Superapp) as reference for how much the margins should be for GRAB.  
Kakao’s EBIT margins for FY21 and 22 is 9.7% and 8.2% respectively.

Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB's main business of being a ride hailing app.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

Taxes, GRAB's taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%. GRAB is based on the Cayman islands, but it does not seem possible for them to avoid taxes and since most of their business operations are done in Southeast Asia, I’d assume they will eventually move to Singapore and pay Singapore taxes.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of ""Adjusted EBITDA"" but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring ""One-Time off transaction"" and in turn rewards managements for beating their ""Adjusted EBITDA"". They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don't like the tale the management constantly spins about ""Adjusted EBITDA"", it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of &amp;quot;Adjusted EBITDA&amp;quot; but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring &amp;quot;One-Time off transaction&amp;quot; and in turn rewards managements for beating their &amp;quot;Adjusted EBITDA&amp;quot;. They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don&amp;#39;t like the tale the management constantly spins about &amp;quot;Adjusted EBITDA&amp;quot;, it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.&lt;/p&gt;

* \- Lagging behind in technology
* \- Poor track record of management
* \- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history
* \- Losing market share in most segments
* \- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues
* \- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush
* \- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days

&amp;#x200B;

Still, let's underline some facts:

**Market valuation landscape:**

* \- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold.
* \- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.

**Strategy:**

Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:

* \- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)
* \- Catching up to TSMC's tech

They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.

Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**

The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.

If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.

We already have positive things to say about their execution:

* \- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.
* \- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.
* \- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.
* \- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irrational fears:**

* \- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:

Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.

* \- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:

Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

*****
&gt; Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.
*****
&gt; Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.
*****
&gt; “Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”
*****
&gt; In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.

I am 33M.  

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.  

I started getting more serious and doing a lot more research in the last year or so and have accepted my losses and sold off my bad investments.  I've now invested in a mix of growth/ETFs like VOO, SCHD, AAPL, and TSLA

Lately, I just feel like the ""safest"" and more guaranteed return on investments are CDs and T-Bills given the interest rates they are offering (5% - 5.5%). I am in the process of setting up a CD/T-Bills ladder where I'd have maturing CDs or T-Bills monthly starting later this year. 

Should I continue with this approach? I know the interest rates will fluctuate and may not always be high but I haven't seen any of my investments besides TSLA really take off (AAPL has done decent). As noted above, I actually lost a good amount in the past.

Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA on Tuesday, pointing to “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,” as well as a growing general debt burden.

Back in May, the agency placed the nation’s AAA rating on negative watch, blaming the debt ceiling fight. At the time, lawmakers in Washington butted heads over an agreement that would keep the federal government from running out of money. President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill on June 2, just days away from the “X-date” on June 5.

The country’s recent debt limit feud was mentioned again in the downgrade.

“In Fitch’s view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025,” the ratings agency said.

“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” Fitch said.

The agency also highlighted the rising general government deficit, which it anticipates will rise to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. “Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending (15% of total federal spending) as agreed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act offer only a modest improvement to the medium-term fiscal outlook,” Fitch said.

The agency also noted that a combination of tightening credit conditions, weakening business investment and a slowdown in consumption could lead the economy into a “mild” recession in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of next year.

This isn’t the first time a rating agency has downgraded the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2011 after Washington managed to avoid a default.

As the tech giant prepares to release its earnings report, analysts emphasise the significance of revealing its utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost growth.

Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv.
Specifically, iPhone sales are anticipated to have declined by over 2% during this period, based on a survey of 24 analysts conducted by Visible Alpha. This contrasts with a nearly 3% increase in sales during the same quarter last year and a 1.5% rise in the preceding quarter (January-March).

The upcoming quarterly report may serve as a deviation from the positive earnings trend observed in other prominent tech companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Microsoft. These companies have demonstrated resilience in their cloud-based operations and have witnessed a surge in digital ad sales.
""Apple is not immune to general macroeconomic trends and will continue to set the pace (for the smartphone industry) for quite some time,"" Reuters quoted Bob O'Donnell, founder of TECHnalysis Research, as saying.
In September, analysts anticipate the unveiling of the much-anticipated iPhone 15, which could feature the widely accepted USB-C port on certain models. This development may provide a slight boost to iPhone sales during the July-September quarter, according to market experts, who have differing opinions on the overall performance during this period.

&gt; A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.
*****
&gt; “I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.
*****
&gt; CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.

Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Wednesday, August the 2nd, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.&lt;/p&gt;

724,stocks,"BKNG has seen excellent growth in both revenue and free cash flow over the previous ten years. The company's sales climbed by 151.57% between 2013 and 2022, with a 9.66% compound yearly growth rate. Similarly, with a CAGR of 10.81%, its free cash flow increased dramatically by 179.03%. This significant expansion demonstrates BKNG's capacity to increase its market presence and successfully seize commercial opportunities over time.  
BKNG's growth prospects are still bright; during the next five years, double-digit earnings growth is anticipated in all but one year. The corporation is anticipated to keep growing its revenues and operating well in the years to come, according to this optimistic prognosis. Going forward, BKNG's connected journey strategy will be one of the primary growth drivers. This approach is based on personalising the travel experience for each consumer utilising data and technology. According to each person's interests, hotels and activities are suggested, and travel schedules are updated in real time.  
There are some risks involved with investing in BKNG because of their business style. Being a business that focuses on travel, BKNG's success is closely correlated with that of the travel sector. Travel spending may decline during economic downturns, which could have an effect on BKNG's operations. While I still believe in the travel sector's long-term promise, I also recognise that it is vulnerable to unanticipated occurrences like the COVID-19 pandemic, which might once again cause travel to be disrupted.  
Despite these dangers, a number of factors are driving future expansion. Since a few years ago, BKNG has made significant investments in AI technology, further demonstrating their dedication to provide consumers with trips that are more connected and personalised. By using AI to analyse information in several languages and provide personalised recommendations, BKNG hopes to improve relationships with customers and partners.   
While other BKNG brands are working to incorporate this technology into their own offers, others, like KAYAK and OpenTable, are actively experimenting with generative AI plug-ins. BKNG is well-positioned to create an engaging and distinctive booking experience, customised to match the various demands of its consumers, thanks to a solid AI base. By utilising AI, I think BKNG will continue to lead the travel sector, constantly enhancing its offerings to give clients the greatest experience possible while encouraging long-term, significant shareholder development.

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks with Tesla Inc., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and other automakers about supplying them with lithium as the oil giant works to build a business around the crucial battery metal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Exxon is one of several oil and gas companies seeking to expand into lithium production to take advantage of surging demand for use in electric-vehicle batteries, and as a way of diversifying beyond fossil fuels. The talks with potential customers are still early stage, and the company has yet to lay out its plans for potential lithium operations.

The company has also had conversations with battery giants Samsung and SK On Co., the people said, asking not to be named because the information is private. Exxon, SK On and Volkswagen declined to comment. Tesla, Ford and Samsung didn’t reply to messages seeking comment.

The rapid global roll out of electric vehicles has raised the risk of bottlenecks and shortages for key battery materials like lithium, sparking a rush to invest in and secure supply.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical analysis (TA)&lt;/strong&gt; uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;priced in&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security&amp;#39;s price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.&lt;/p&gt;

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html""&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.
*****
&gt; Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.
*****
&gt; More than 160 S&amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.
*****
&gt; To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.
*****
&gt; “We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”
*****
&gt; He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.
*****
&gt; “As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.
*****
&gt; Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.

&lt;p&gt;Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively.

What do you guys think of LICY? They are a industry leader in lithium-ion battery resource recovery and the leading lithium-ion battery recycler in North America.  I'll admit, I'm still learning how to read into company finances but the on the surface it seems like a company that can have significant growth in the future.

With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans.

762,stocks,"I was wondering if anyone is holding NTDOF and wanted to post info about the dividend yield and ADR Fees?  I was sort of curious is it better long term to hold NTDOY and NDTOF and find it hard to compare the ""cost structure"".

I had a few shares of NTDOY recently on a dividend payout with this cost structure info

1 share NTDOY (currently trades $11.28) is 1/4th of Nintendo 7974.T stock  
Dividend declared 123 yen/share or 30.75 yen/NTDOY   
Dividend received in US account on July 11th when yen to dollar was 140.27yen/dollar  
Dividend I received of $0.214 per NTDOY after-foreign taxes withheld and conversion to the dollar  
This means 0.214 was received when the conversion would be 0.219 so approx -3% to taxes  
ADR maintenance fee charged after the dividend of $0.0299 / share meaning $0.1841 received  


Final net of 0.1841/share on estimated 0.219 payout is 84% efficiency or in other words -16% of the dividend payout goes to foreign taxes and also ADR fees before US taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a similar experience seeing about 16% of the yield value go out the door to ADR?  While I like NTDOY, I was curious if NTDOF has a lower fee in the end, was wondering if anyone is holding it and wants to look at it and compare?

I was sort of curious is it better long term to hold NTDOY and NDTOF and find it hard to compare the &amp;quot;cost structure&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a few shares of NTDOY recently on a dividend payout with this cost structure info&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 share NTDOY (currently trades $11.28) is 1/4th of Nintendo 7974.T stock&lt;br/&gt;
Dividend declared 123 yen/share or 30.75 yen/NTDOY&lt;br/&gt;
Dividend received in US account on July 11th when yen to dollar was 140.27yen/dollar&lt;br/&gt;
Dividend I received of $0.214 per NTDOY after-foreign taxes withheld and conversion to the dollar&lt;br/&gt;
This means 0.214 was received when the conversion would be 0.219 so approx -3% to taxes&lt;br/&gt;
ADR maintenance fee charged after the dividend of $0.0299 / share meaning $0.1841 received  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final net of 0.1841/share on estimated 0.219 payout is 84% efficiency or in other words -16% of the dividend payout goes to foreign taxes and also ADR fees before US taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have a similar experience seeing about 16% of the yield value go out the door to ADR?  While I like NTDOY, I was curious if NTDOF has a lower fee in the end, was wondering if anyone is holding it and wants to look at it and compare? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ADRS trade at the same relative price adjusting for share % but in my view if one has significantly lower fees it would be a better buy.  &lt;/p&gt;

More than 1 million Netflix accounts and around 800,000 Disney+ subscribers in the U.S. are on ad-supported tiers, according to Ampere, representing nearly 2% of each service’s total subscriber base. The firm estimates that more than 90% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad-supported tier, representing around 45 million subscriptions.

Prior to the launch of Max, Discovery+ had somewhere in the region of 10 million ad-supported accounts, while HBO Max had around 2 million, Ampere said. It added that Peacock has more than 30 million ad-supported subscribers, the most of any new U.S. OTT service, while Paramount+ has more than 25 million ad-supported subscribers in the U.S.

Ampere believes that hybrid services are “an increasingly important element of streaming service monetization, and hybrid tiers often generate more revenue per subscription than their ad-free counterparts.” It also says that the tiers “represent a way for consumers to maintain a wider array of subscriptions while economic times remain tough.”

Ampere’s latest research comes as earnings season for the major studios is in full swing.

Netflix, which recently eliminated its basic ad-free plan in the United States as it expands its password sharing crackdown, added 5.9 million paid subscribers during the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 238.4 million globally. During its upfront presentation to advertisers in May, Netflix reported that the ad tier had nearly 5 million monthly active users.

Meanwhile, NBCUniversal parent Comcast reported that Peacock had a total of 24 million paid subscribers. The streaming service, which dropped its free tier for new users in January, recently said it would bump up the price for its Premium and Premium Plus tiers to $5.99 and $11.99, respectively, which will take effect on Aug. 17. Due to certain streaming rights and contracts with content providers, some Peacock content still has ads.

Next up on the earnings docket will be Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its Max rebrand on May 23 — which offers a $9.99 per month Max Ad Lite tier, $15.99 per month Max Ad Free tier and $19.99 per month Max Ultimate Ad Free tier.

770,stocks,"*BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year*

Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 31.07.23, 08:15 AM

Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).

The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.

The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.

At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.

BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.

When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.

In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.

Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.

“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.

**Galloping run**

The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.

”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.

A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).

”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.

In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.

”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.

The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”

**Strategic role**

The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.

Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.

BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.

For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.

Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.

**Tightrope**

Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.

The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.

”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.

Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.

The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galloping run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightrope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.&lt;/p&gt;

779,stocks,"**Clarifying and Contextualizing the Question:**  
I'm a ""put your money where your mouth is"" type guy. Over the past couple of years I have been persuaded that aliens not only exist (I feel like most rational people already believe this), but that we have been visited by intelligent life. I think powerful institutions know this, and I agree with the sentiment of others that they are in the process of slowly bestowing this knowledge upon us. Furthermore, I think their timeframe for divulgence is capped: nowadays, the average person has far better equipment on them to capture an inexplicable phenomena than they did in Roswell times. This is only getting better and at some point the decision to divulge may be out of the hands of powerful institutions.  
With this in mind, my personal opinion is that in the next 5-10 years aliens will be revealed to exist and have visited earth.

I&amp;#39;m a &amp;quot;put your money where your mouth is&amp;quot; type guy. Over the past couple of years I have been persuaded that aliens not only exist (I feel like most rational people already believe this), but that we have been visited by intelligent life. I think powerful institutions know this, and I agree with the sentiment of others that they are in the process of slowly bestowing this knowledge upon us. Furthermore, I think their timeframe for divulgence is capped: nowadays, the average person has far better equipment on them to capture an inexplicable phenomena than they did in Roswell times. This is only getting better and at some point the decision to divulge may be out of the hands of powerful institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
With this in mind, my personal opinion is that in the next 5-10 years aliens will be revealed to exist and have visited earth.

1. **Share price rises to strike price ($12)** \- You make $200.00 from the stock increasing, plus $50 for the sale of the contract. You are obligated to sell 100 shares for $12.00 each to the buyer. Your net profit is $250.00.
2. **Price goes way up, (example, share price increase to $50.00)** \- You make $200.00 from the stock increasing, but you don't profit any further than your strike price. Also, $5 for the sale of the contract. You are obligated to sell your 100 shares for $12.00 each to the buyer. Your net profit is $250.00.
3. **Price goes down (example, share price decrease to $8.00)** \- You lose $200 from the stock decreasing. You gain $50.00 from the sale of the contract. Net loss - $150

GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.  


# REVENUE:

I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB's actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I'd assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. ([SOURCE](https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html))  
  
Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.

Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB's main business of being a ride hailing app.

Taxes, GRAB's taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of ""Adjusted EBITDA"" but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring ""One-Time off transaction"" and in turn rewards managements for beating their ""Adjusted EBITDA"". They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don't like the tale the management constantly spins about ""Adjusted EBITDA"", it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.

* \- Lagging behind in technology
* \- Poor track record of management
* \- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history
* \- Losing market share in most segments
* \- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues
* \- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush
* \- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days

&amp;#x200B;

Still, let's underline some facts:

**Market valuation landscape:**

* \- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold.
* \- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.

**Strategy:**

Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:

* \- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)
* \- Catching up to TSMC's tech

They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.

Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**

The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.

If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.

We already have positive things to say about their execution:

* \- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.
* \- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.
* \- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.
* \- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irrational fears:**

* \- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:

Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.

* \- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:

Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you for your points of view, they give me more to think about. After all, my goal is to make the most fair case and orient my thoughts, as I see no good or current publication about this.

&lt;p&gt;The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have positive things to say about their execution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irrational fears:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, it&amp;#39;s one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it&amp;#39;s a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatable, but it&amp;#39;s not wise to make decisions on these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn&amp;#39;t look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thank you for your points of view, they give me more to think about. After all, my goal is to make the most fair case and orient my thoughts, as I see no good or current publication about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

# [Stock futures fall after U.S. downgrade spurs a sell-off, traders scrutinize latest earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.
*****
&gt; Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.
*****
&gt; “Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”
*****
&gt; In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Thursday, August 3rd, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Thursday, August the 3rd, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall after U.S. downgrade spurs a sell-off, traders scrutinize latest earnings: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures tied to the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I am 33M.  

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.  

I started getting more serious and doing a lot more research in the last year or so and have accepted my losses and sold off my bad investments.  I've now invested in a mix of growth/ETFs like VOO, SCHD, AAPL, and TSLA

I have two others in SPYD (don't ask why) and AUTL (hoping they get acquired) but not a significant amount in either. The rest of the money I just keep as SPAXX in Fidelity 

Lately, I just feel like the ""safest"" and more guaranteed return on investments are CDs and T-Bills given the interest rates they are offering (5% - 5.5%). I am in the process of setting up a CD/T-Bills ladder where I'd have maturing CDs or T-Bills monthly starting later this year. 

Should I continue with this approach? I know the interest rates will fluctuate and may not always be high but I haven't seen any of my investments besides TSLA really take off (AAPL has done decent). As noted above, I actually lost a good amount in the past.  

Right now, my goal is to not think about it everyday and just have my money grow over time (I will not need the cash). Should I just put it all in VOO? Leave it in SPAXX? Or just continue the ladder strategy? Are there any risks I'm not considering?

I also have some money just sitting in Robinhood, which earns me 4.9% APY (with gold). Most of it is in Fidelity.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;

Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA on Tuesday, pointing to “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,” as well as a growing general debt burden.

Back in May, the agency placed the nation’s AAA rating on negative watch, blaming the debt ceiling fight. At the time, lawmakers in Washington butted heads over an agreement that would keep the federal government from running out of money. President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill on June 2, just days away from the “X-date” on June 5.

The country’s recent debt limit feud was mentioned again in the downgrade.

“In Fitch’s view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025,” the ratings agency said.

“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” Fitch said.

The agency also highlighted the rising general government deficit, which it anticipates will rise to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. “Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending (15% of total federal spending) as agreed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act offer only a modest improvement to the medium-term fiscal outlook,” Fitch said.

The agency also noted that a combination of tightening credit conditions, weakening business investment and a slowdown in consumption could lead the economy into a “mild” recession in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of next year.

This isn’t the first time a rating agency has downgraded the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2011 after Washington managed to avoid a default. At the time, the agency highlighted political risk as part of its reasoning.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As the tech giant prepares to release its earnings report, analysts emphasise the significance of revealing its utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost growth.

Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv.

# [Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”
*****
&gt; A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.
*****
&gt; “I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.
*****
&gt; CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Wednesday, August 2nd, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Wednesday, August the 2nd, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are some risks involved with investing in BKNG because of their business style. Being a business that focuses on travel, BKNG's success is closely correlated with that of the travel sector.

The company released its second-quarter financial results on Thursday. The U.S.-based automaker's EV division, called ""Ford Model e,"" has lost $1.8 billion so far this year, according to Fortune.

The projected $4.5 billion loss is over twice as much as Model e's $2.1 billion loss in 2022. The company recently announced that the price of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks will be reduced due to cheaper raw battery materials.

The company touted that its low EV prices ""establish[es] leadership ahead of industry’s next-generation EVs"" and that the Ford Model e's revenue is up 39%. Ford is also expected to produce 600,000 EVs per year by 2024.

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks with Tesla Inc., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and other automakers about supplying them with lithium as the oil giant works to build a business around the crucial battery metal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Exxon is one of several oil and gas companies seeking to expand into lithium production to take advantage of surging demand for use in electric-vehicle batteries, and as a way of diversifying beyond fossil fuels. The talks with potential customers are still early stage, and the company has yet to lay out its plans for potential lithium operations.

The company has also had conversations with battery giants Samsung and SK On Co., the people said, asking not to be named because the information is private. Exxon, SK On and Volkswagen declined to comment. Tesla, Ford and Samsung didn’t reply to messages seeking comment.

The rapid global roll out of electric vehicles has raised the risk of bottlenecks and shortages for key battery materials like lithium, sparking a rush to invest in and secure supply.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.
[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%.

&lt;p&gt;July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year&amp;#39;s biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market&amp;#39;s rally through May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year&amp;#39;s biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market&amp;#39;s rally through May.
[Money doesn&amp;#39;t grow on trees]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;amp;P 500 (&lt;sup&gt;GSPC)&lt;/sup&gt; logging gains between June and July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while the aforementioned stars of this year&amp;#39;s rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we&amp;#39;ve been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broadening of the market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl&amp;#39;s (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (&lt;sup&gt;DJI).&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.&lt;/p&gt;

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street’s busiest earnings week continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.
*****
&gt; Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.
*****
&gt; More than 160 S&amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.
*****
&gt; To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.
*****
&gt; “We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”
*****
&gt; He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.
*****
&gt; “As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.
*****
&gt; Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.

[This website lists the YTD price performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance), so not including dividends.

- 30% YTD: 75
- 40% YTD: 47
- 50% YTD: 27
- 60% YTD: 15

Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by $2.7 billion, up 26% during the second quarter to $12.7 billion at quarterend, and over 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are from direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the second quarter, the median FICO score was 747. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans. Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. SoFi Bank, N.A. generated $63.1 million of GAAP net income at a 17% margin.”

SoFi continues to thrive in this macro environment:

* Galileo, Technisys, and bank charter form the pillars for SoFi to become ""The AWS of Fintech""
* The acquisition of Wyndham Capital on April 3rd completes the three arms of lending under one umbrella. This cut off the middleman fee and maximizes profitability for the most lucrative segment of SoFi's businesses.
* The wide diversity of SoFi business allows it to thrive in any macro environment.
* SoFi's Savings with direct deposit APY of 4.4% gives an extra push for deposit growth in subsequent quarters.

862,stocks,"I was wondering if anyone is holding NTDOF and wanted to post info about the dividend yield and ADR Fees?  I was sort of curious is it better long term to hold NTDOY and NDTOF and find it hard to compare the ""cost structure"".

I had a few shares of NTDOY recently on a dividend payout with this cost structure info

1 share NTDOY (currently trades $11.28) is 1/4th of Nintendo 7974.T stock  
Dividend declared 123 yen/share or 30.75 yen/NTDOY   
Dividend received in US account on July 11th when yen to dollar was 140.27yen/dollar  
Dividend I received of $0.214 per NTDOY after-foreign taxes withheld and conversion to the dollar  
This means 0.214 was received when the conversion would be 0.219 so approx -3% to taxes  
ADR maintenance fee charged after the dividend of $0.0299 / share meaning $0.1841 received  


Final net of 0.1841/share on estimated 0.219 payout is 84% efficiency or in other words -16% of the dividend payout goes to foreign taxes and also ADR fees before US taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a similar experience seeing about 16% of the yield value go out the door to ADR?  While I like NTDOY, I was curious if NTDOF has a lower fee in the end, was wondering if anyone is holding it and wants to look at it and compare? 

The ADRS trade at the same relative price adjusting for share % but in my view if one has significantly lower fees it would be a better buy.

865,stocks,"Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.

More than 1 million Netflix accounts and around 800,000 Disney+ subscribers in the U.S. are on ad-supported tiers, according to Ampere, representing nearly 2% of each service’s total subscriber base. The firm estimates that more than 90% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad-supported tier, representing around 45 million subscriptions.

Prior to the launch of Max, Discovery+ had somewhere in the region of 10 million ad-supported accounts, while HBO Max had around 2 million, Ampere said. It added that Peacock has more than 30 million ad-supported subscribers, the most of any new U.S. OTT service, while Paramount+ has more than 25 million ad-supported subscribers in the U.S.

Ampere believes that hybrid services are “an increasingly important element of streaming service monetization, and hybrid tiers often generate more revenue per subscription than their ad-free counterparts.” It also says that the tiers “represent a way for consumers to maintain a wider array of subscriptions while economic times remain tough.”

Ampere’s latest research comes as earnings season for the major studios is in full swing.

Netflix, which recently eliminated its basic ad-free plan in the United States as it expands its password sharing crackdown, added 5.9 million paid subscribers during the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 238.4 million globally. During its upfront presentation to advertisers in May, Netflix reported that the ad tier had nearly 5 million monthly active users.

Meanwhile, NBCUniversal parent Comcast reported that Peacock had a total of 24 million paid subscribers. The streaming service, which dropped its free tier for new users in January, recently said it would bump up the price for its Premium and Premium Plus tiers to $5.99 and $11.99, respectively, which will take effect on Aug. 17. Due to certain streaming rights and contracts with content providers, some Peacock content still has ads.

Next up on the earnings docket will be Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its Max rebrand on May 23 — which offers a $9.99 per month Max Ad Lite tier, $15.99 per month Max Ad Free tier and $19.99 per month Max Ultimate Ad Free tier.

Meanwhile, Paramount Global, which charges $5.99 per month for its ad-supported option, and Disney, which launched its $7.99 per month ad-supported Disney+ tier in November, will report earnings on Aug. 7 and 9, respectively.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand raising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, encourages savings and makes lending harder, hence discouraging inflation. Cool

870,stocks,"*BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year*

Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 31.07.23, 08:15 AM

Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).

The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.

The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.

At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.

BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.

When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.

In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.

Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.

“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.

**Galloping run**

The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.

”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.

A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).

”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.

In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.

”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.

The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”

**Strategic role**

The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.

Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.

BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.

For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.

Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.

**Tightrope**

Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.

The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.

”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.

Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.

Comparing Kroger to other supermarket chains (like Walmart, Target or Cotsco) make the company seem extremely undervalued.

The biggest treat I can see is the competition from Whole Food and Amazon Fresh, but their stores aren't necesserely in the same cities, and taking over a grocery gigant like Kroger (2700 stores if I am not wrong) would be a very big task, requiring huge investments and crazy capex.

2. **Price goes way up, (example, share price increase to $50.00)** \- You make $200.00 from the stock increasing, but you don't profit any further than your strike price. Also, $5 for the sale of the contract. You are obligated to sell your 100 shares for $12.00 each to the buyer. Your net profit is $250.00.
3. **Price goes down (example, share price decrease to $8.00)** \- You lose $200 from the stock decreasing. You gain $50.00 from the sale of the contract. Net loss - $150

897,stocks,"# INTRODUCTION:

GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.  


# REVENUE:

I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB's actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I'd assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. ([SOURCE](https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html))  
  
Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.  
  
REVENUE MODEL: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/q1x5t39))  


# COST:

A cost breakdown of GRAB as of FY22 is 94.6% Incentive given to drivers, 19.5% Marketing, 45.1% G&amp;A, 32.5% R&amp;D. The percentage adds to more than 100% because GRAB is losing money.   
  
  
Taking ComfortDelGro (Traditional Taxi) and Kakao (Superapp) as reference for how much the margins should be for GRAB.  
Kakao’s EBIT margins for FY21 and 22 is 9.7% and 8.2% respectively.  
“ComfortDelGro’s taxi earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin is…15.6% in 2019” ([SOURCE](https://sbr.com.sg/transport-logistics/news/comfortdelgro-taxis-profit-margin-shrinks-2-in-2020-maybank-kim-eng))  
Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB's main business of being a ride hailing app.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

Taxes, GRAB's taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%. GRAB is based on the Cayman islands, but it does not seem possible for them to avoid taxes and since most of their business operations are done in Southeast Asia, I’d assume they will eventually move to Singapore and pay Singapore taxes.  
  
NOLs, I assume that GRAB will turn profitable in 2027. Breakdown of NOL expiry dates ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/zurV11L)), Under the assumption that during the period of my forecast, no more NOLs are added. Unutilized NOLs as of 2022 are 3275M. Taking into account the time factor, NOLs are 2163M.  
  
Employee stock options, ESOs breakdown([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/d01avGW)) Using the treasury stock method, 19.9M stocks are added.  
  
Time to profit, It took KakaoTAXI 3 years to break even([SOURCE](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kakao-southkorea-idUSKCN1GP11O)). Because Kakao had already been a large player when they entered the ride sharing business and had been previously profitable, the market conditions are drastically different. I’d assume that GRAB takes about 7 years from the first year they started reporting their financials.  


Change in NWC, Opting for less granularity I'd assume that the day turnovers are average of historical data and assumed constant throughout  
Change in NWC Schedule: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/qLZNJs6))  
  
CapEX and D&amp;A, GRAB have been Net negative CapEX from 2019 - 2022. I’d assume that they ramp up Capital Expenditure for 3 years in line with management’s goal of wanting to fully penetrate into Southeast Asia which has yet to be substantially broken into by the company.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of ""Adjusted EBITDA"" but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring ""One-Time off transaction"" and in turn rewards managements for beating their ""Adjusted EBITDA"". They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don't like the tale the management constantly spins about ""Adjusted EBITDA"", it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;INTRODUCTION:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;REVENUE:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB&amp;#39;s actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I&amp;#39;d assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. (&lt;a href=""https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REVENUE MODEL: (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/q1x5t39""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;COST:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cost breakdown of GRAB as of FY22 is 94.6% Incentive given to drivers, 19.5% Marketing, 45.1% G&amp;amp;A, 32.5% R&amp;amp;D. The percentage adds to more than 100% because GRAB is losing money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking ComfortDelGro (Traditional Taxi) and Kakao (Superapp) as reference for how much the margins should be for GRAB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kakao’s EBIT margins for FY21 and 22 is 9.7% and 8.2% respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ComfortDelGro’s taxi earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin is…15.6% in 2019” (&lt;a href=""https://sbr.com.sg/transport-logistics/news/comfortdelgro-taxis-profit-margin-shrinks-2-in-2020-maybank-kim-eng""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB&amp;#39;s main business of being a ride hailing app.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ASSUMPTIONS:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxes, GRAB&amp;#39;s taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%. GRAB is based on the Cayman islands, but it does not seem possible for them to avoid taxes and since most of their business operations are done in Southeast Asia, I’d assume they will eventually move to Singapore and pay Singapore taxes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOLs, I assume that GRAB will turn profitable in 2027. Breakdown of NOL expiry dates (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/zurV11L""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;), Under the assumption that during the period of my forecast, no more NOLs are added. Unutilized NOLs as of 2022 are 3275M. Taking into account the time factor, NOLs are 2163M.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employee stock options, ESOs breakdown(&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/d01avGW""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;) Using the treasury stock method, 19.9M stocks are added.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to profit, It took KakaoTAXI 3 years to break even(&lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kakao-southkorea-idUSKCN1GP11O""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;). Because Kakao had already been a large player when they entered the ride sharing business and had been previously profitable, the market conditions are drastically different. I’d assume that GRAB takes about 7 years from the first year they started reporting their financials.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change in NWC, Opting for less granularity I&amp;#39;d assume that the day turnovers are average of historical data and assumed constant throughout&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change in NWC Schedule: (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/qLZNJs6""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CapEX and D&amp;amp;A, GRAB have been Net negative CapEX from 2019 - 2022. I’d assume that they ramp up Capital Expenditure for 3 years in line with management’s goal of wanting to fully penetrate into Southeast Asia which has yet to be substantially broken into by the company.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WACC:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;COST OF EQUITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFR (1M Avg) = 3.82%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta = 0.88&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 Earnings Yield (1M Avg) = 4.25%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4050 = (4050 * 4.25%) * (1+16%) / (1+R) + [((4050 * 4.25%) * (1+16%)) * (1+3.82%) / (R - 3.82%)] / (1 + R) ^ 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R = 10.3%, ERP = 6.48%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COE = 9.52%  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;COST OF DEBT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRAB has a bond rating of BB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BB Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 6.92%  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WEIGHTAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOAN Schedule: (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/LkS6vl5""&gt;SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt = 1400M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share Price (1M Avg) = $3.49&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares O/S = 3968M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market Value of Equity = 13848M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;%Equity = 90.8%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;%Debt = 10.2%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marginal Tax Rate = 17%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WACC = 8.65%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially.

* \- Lagging behind in technology
* \- Poor track record of management
* \- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history
* \- Losing market share in most segments
* \- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues
* \- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush
* \- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days

&amp;#x200B;

Still, let's underline some facts:

**Market valuation landscape:**

* \- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold.
* \- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.

**Strategy:**

Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:

* \- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)
* \- Catching up to TSMC's tech

They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.

Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**

The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.

If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.

We already have positive things to say about their execution:

* \- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.
* \- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.
* \- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.
* \- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irrational fears:**

* \- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:

Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.

* \- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:

Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.

*****
&gt; Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.
*****
&gt; Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.
*****
&gt; “Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”
*****
&gt; In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.

I am 33M.  

I've been unlucky since I started investing about 5 years ago. I had no idea what I was doing for about 3 years and in total lost about $20k altogether.  

I started getting more serious and doing a lot more research in the last year or so and have accepted my losses and sold off my bad investments.  I've now invested in a mix of growth/ETFs like VOO, SCHD, AAPL, and TSLA

I have two others in SPYD (don't ask why) and AUTL (hoping they get acquired) but not a significant amount in either. The rest of the money I just keep as SPAXX in Fidelity 

Lately, I just feel like the ""safest"" and more guaranteed return on investments are CDs and T-Bills given the interest rates they are offering (5% - 5.5%). I am in the process of setting up a CD/T-Bills ladder where I'd have maturing CDs or T-Bills monthly starting later this year. 

Should I continue with this approach? I know the interest rates will fluctuate and may not always be high but I haven't seen any of my investments besides TSLA really take off (AAPL has done decent). As noted above, I actually lost a good amount in the past.  

Right now, my goal is to not think about it everyday and just have my money grow over time (I will not need the cash). Should I just put it all in VOO? Leave it in SPAXX? Or just continue the ladder strategy? Are there any risks I'm not considering?

Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA on Tuesday, pointing to “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,” as well as a growing general debt burden.

Back in May, the agency placed the nation’s AAA rating on negative watch, blaming the debt ceiling fight. At the time, lawmakers in Washington butted heads over an agreement that would keep the federal government from running out of money. President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill on June 2, just days away from the “X-date” on June 5.

The country’s recent debt limit feud was mentioned again in the downgrade.

“In Fitch’s view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025,” the ratings agency said.

“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” Fitch said.

The agency also highlighted the rising general government deficit, which it anticipates will rise to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. “Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending (15% of total federal spending) as agreed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act offer only a modest improvement to the medium-term fiscal outlook,” Fitch said.

The agency also noted that a combination of tightening credit conditions, weakening business investment and a slowdown in consumption could lead the economy into a “mild” recession in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of next year.

This isn’t the first time a rating agency has downgraded the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2011 after Washington managed to avoid a default. At the time, the agency highlighted political risk as part of its reasoning.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/fitch-downgrades-us-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Amazon is opening up its Fresh grocery delivery service to people without Prime in select U.S. cities.

Amazon will charge non-Prime members $13.95 for deliveries under $50, while orders between $50 and $100 will incur a $10.95 fee, and orders over $100 will carry a $7.95 delivery fee.

# [Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”
*****
&gt; A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.
*****
&gt; “I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.
*****
&gt; CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norwegian Cruise Line&lt;/strong&gt; — The stock fell 3.2% in premarket trading after the company posted its earnings results on Tuesday, which indicated weaker-than-expected guidance for the third quarter. The cruise ship operator topped Wall Street’s estimates, however. On Wednesday, Susquehanna downgraded its rating on Norwegian shares to neutral from positive. It maintained its price target of $17, which suggests a 12.4% downside from Tuesday’s close.&lt;/p&gt;

This significant expansion demonstrates BKNG's capacity to increase its market presence and successfully seize commercial opportunities over time.  
BKNG's growth prospects are still bright; during the next five years, double-digit earnings growth is anticipated in all but one year. The corporation is anticipated to keep growing its revenues and operating well in the years to come, according to this optimistic prognosis. Going forward, BKNG's connected journey strategy will be one of the primary growth drivers. This approach is based on personalising the travel experience for each consumer utilising data and technology. According to each person's interests, hotels and activities are suggested, and travel schedules are updated in real time.  
There are some risks involved with investing in BKNG because of their business style. Being a business that focuses on travel, BKNG's success is closely correlated with that of the travel sector. Travel spending may decline during economic downturns, which could have an effect on BKNG's operations. While I still believe in the travel sector's long-term promise, I also recognise that it is vulnerable to unanticipated occurrences like the COVID-19 pandemic, which might once again cause travel to be disrupted.  
Despite these dangers, a number of factors are driving future expansion. Since a few years ago, BKNG has made significant investments in AI technology, further demonstrating their dedication to provide consumers with trips that are more connected and personalised. By using AI to analyse information in several languages and provide personalised recommendations, BKNG hopes to improve relationships with customers and partners.   
While other BKNG brands are working to incorporate this technology into their own offers, others, like KAYAK and OpenTable, are actively experimenting with generative AI plug-ins. BKNG is well-positioned to create an engaging and distinctive booking experience, customised to match the various demands of its consumers, thanks to a solid AI base.

That is some colossal competition which begs the question - how can DigitalOcean compete?

They recently acquired the cloud infrastructure and software startup - Paperspace.

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks with Tesla Inc., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and other automakers about supplying them with lithium as the oil giant works to build a business around the crucial battery metal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Exxon is one of several oil and gas companies seeking to expand into lithium production to take advantage of surging demand for use in electric-vehicle batteries, and as a way of diversifying beyond fossil fuels. The talks with potential customers are still early stage, and the company has yet to lay out its plans for potential lithium operations. However, the discussions are the latest sign of Exxon’s growing interest in the lithium business.

The company has also had conversations with battery giants Samsung and SK On Co., the people said, asking not to be named because the information is private. Exxon, SK On and Volkswagen declined to comment. Tesla, Ford and Samsung didn’t reply to messages seeking comment.

The rapid global roll out of electric vehicles has raised the risk of bottlenecks and shortages for key battery materials like lithium, sparking a rush to invest in and secure supply. The world will need nearly 60 new lithium mines and plants to feed the growing demand for the shift away from fossil fuels, according to researcher Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, and more lithium will be required in 2030 than was mined between 2015 and 2022.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/exxon-in-talks-with-tesla-ford-volkswagen-on-supplying-lithium?leadSource=uverify%20wall""&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/exxon-in-talks-with-tesla-ford-volkswagen-on-supplying-lithium?leadSource=uverify%20wall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.
[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street’s busiest earnings week continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.
*****
&gt; Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.
*****
&gt; More than 160 S&amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.
*****
&gt; To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.
*****
&gt; “We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”
*****
&gt; He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.
*****
&gt; “As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.
*****
&gt; Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, August 1st, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading month of August and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Tuesday, August the 1st, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall as Wall Street’s busiest earnings week continues: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 160 S&amp;amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[This website lists the YTD price performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance), so not including dividends.

Number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 over ___ YTD:

- 30% YTD: 75
- 40% YTD: 47
- 50% YTD: 27
- 60% YTD: 15

About 172 stocks have a possibly negative YTD price return (again, excluding dividends). 328 are positive YTD.

""Management expects to generate $1.025 to $1.085 billion of adjusted net revenue in the second half of 2023, up 19% to 26% year-over-year, and $180 to $190 million of adjusted EBITDA. For the full year 2023, management expects adjusted net revenue of $1.974 to $2.034 billion, up from its prior guidance of $1.955 to $2.02 billion, and full-year adjusted EBITDA of $333 to $343 million, up from its prior guidance of $268 to $288 million, representing a 40-44% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin. Management projects that a more significant portion of the second half adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA results will be generated during the fourth quarter. As the company moves toward expected GAAP net income profitability in the fourth quarter, management expects share-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses to be slightly higher than reported second quarter 2023 levels in both the third and fourth quarters of the year.""

Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by $2.7 billion, up 26% during the second quarter to $12.7 billion at quarterend, and over 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are from direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the second quarter, the median FICO score was 747. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans. Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. SoFi Bank, N.A. generated $63.1 million of GAAP net income at a 17% margin.”

SoFi continues to thrive in this macro environment:

* Galileo, Technisys, and bank charter form the pillars for SoFi to become ""The AWS of Fintech""
* The acquisition of Wyndham Capital on April 3rd completes the three arms of lending under one umbrella. This cut off the middleman fee and maximizes profitability for the most lucrative segment of SoFi's businesses.
* The wide diversity of SoFi business allows it to thrive in any macro environment.

&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Record GAAP and Adjusted Net Revenue for Second Quarter 2023&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GAAP Net Revenue of $498 Million Up 37%; $489 Million Adjusted Net Revenue Up 37% Year-over-Year&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Management Raises Full-Year 2023 Guidance&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Management expects to generate $1.025 to $1.085 billion of adjusted net revenue in the second half of 2023, up 19% to 26% year-over-year, and $180 to $190 million of adjusted EBITDA. For the full year 2023, management expects adjusted net revenue of $1.974 to $2.034 billion, up from its prior guidance of $1.955 to $2.02 billion, and full-year adjusted EBITDA of $333 to $343 million, up from its prior guidance of $268 to $288 million, representing a 40-44% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin. Management projects that a more significant portion of the second half adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA results will be generated during the fourth quarter. As the company moves toward expected GAAP net income profitability in the fourth quarter, management expects share-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses to be slightly higher than reported second quarter 2023 levels in both the third and fourth quarters of the year.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by $2.7 billion, up 26% during the second quarter to $12.7 billion at quarterend, and over 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are from direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the second quarter, the median FICO score was 747. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans. Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. SoFi Bank, N.A. generated $63.1 million of GAAP net income at a 17% margin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SoFi continues to thrive in this macro environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Galileo, Technisys, and bank charter form the pillars for SoFi to become &amp;quot;The AWS of Fintech&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The acquisition of Wyndham Capital on April 3rd completes the three arms of lending under one umbrella. This cut off the middleman fee and maximizes profitability for the most lucrative segment of SoFi&amp;#39;s businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wide diversity of SoFi business allows it to thrive in any macro environment.&lt;/li&gt;

I had a few shares of NTDOY recently on a dividend payout with this cost structure info

1 share NTDOY (currently trades $11.28) is 1/4th of Nintendo 7974.T stock  
Dividend declared 123 yen/share or 30.75 yen/NTDOY   
Dividend received in US account on July 11th when yen to dollar was 140.27yen/dollar  
Dividend I received of $0.214 per NTDOY after-foreign taxes withheld and conversion to the dollar  
This means 0.214 was received when the conversion would be 0.219 so approx -3% to taxes  
ADR maintenance fee charged after the dividend of $0.0299 / share meaning $0.1841 received  


Final net of 0.1841/share on estimated 0.219 payout is 84% efficiency or in other words -16% of the dividend payout goes to foreign taxes and also ADR fees before US taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a similar experience seeing about 16% of the yield value go out the door to ADR?  While I like NTDOY, I was curious if NTDOF has a lower fee in the end, was wondering if anyone is holding it and wants to look at it and compare?

965,stocks,"Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.

More than 1 million Netflix accounts and around 800,000 Disney+ subscribers in the U.S. are on ad-supported tiers, according to Ampere, representing nearly 2% of each service’s total subscriber base. The firm estimates that more than 90% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad-supported tier, representing around 45 million subscriptions.

Prior to the launch of Max, Discovery+ had somewhere in the region of 10 million ad-supported accounts, while HBO Max had around 2 million, Ampere said. It added that Peacock has more than 30 million ad-supported subscribers, the most of any new U.S. OTT service, while Paramount+ has more than 25 million ad-supported subscribers in the U.S.

Ampere believes that hybrid services are “an increasingly important element of streaming service monetization, and hybrid tiers often generate more revenue per subscription than their ad-free counterparts.” It also says that the tiers “represent a way for consumers to maintain a wider array of subscriptions while economic times remain tough.”

Ampere’s latest research comes as earnings season for the major studios is in full swing.

Netflix, which recently eliminated its basic ad-free plan in the United States as it expands its password sharing crackdown, added 5.9 million paid subscribers during the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 238.4 million globally. During its upfront presentation to advertisers in May, Netflix reported that the ad tier had nearly 5 million monthly active users.

Meanwhile, NBCUniversal parent Comcast reported that Peacock had a total of 24 million paid subscribers. The streaming service, which dropped its free tier for new users in January, recently said it would bump up the price for its Premium and Premium Plus tiers to $5.99 and $11.99, respectively, which will take effect on Aug. 17. Due to certain streaming rights and contracts with content providers, some Peacock content still has ads.

Next up on the earnings docket will be Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its Max rebrand on May 23 — which offers a $9.99 per month Max Ad Lite tier, $15.99 per month Max Ad Free tier and $19.99 per month Max Ultimate Ad Free tier.

I understand raising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, encourages savings and makes lending harder, hence discouraging inflation. Cool

For unemployment to go up, I would assume ( based on these general logics ) that once inflation cools, the unemployment rate may increase as people who have saved up enough can be unemployed, or whatever reason just be unemployed.



Finally, I assume these rates have other things factored in- like the fact the new young people join the workforce every year. And, that since student loan payments were paused, and the average American doesn't just reduce spending, but increases their credit usage more ( when inflation strikes )

970,stocks,"*BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year*

Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 31.07.23, 08:15 AM

Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).

The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.

The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.

At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.

BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.

When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.

In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.

Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.

“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.

**Galloping run**

The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.

”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.

A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).

”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.

In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.

”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.

The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”

**Strategic role**

The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.

Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.

BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.

For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.

Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.

**Tightrope**

Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.

The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.

”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.

Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.

&lt;p&gt;Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 31.07.23, 08:15 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.&lt;/p&gt;

Comparing Kroger to other supermarket chains (like Walmart, Target or Cotsco) make the company seem extremely undervalued.

The biggest treat I can see is the competition from Whole Food and Amazon Fresh, but their stores aren't necesserely in the same cities, and taking over a grocery gigant like Kroger (2700 stores if I am not wrong) would be a very big task, requiring huge investments and crazy capex.

GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.  


# REVENUE:

I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB's actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I'd assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. ([SOURCE](https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html))  
  
Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.  
  
REVENUE MODEL: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/q1x5t39))  


# COST:

A cost breakdown of GRAB as of FY22 is 94.6% Incentive given to drivers, 19.5% Marketing, 45.1% G&amp;A, 32.5% R&amp;D. The percentage adds to more than 100% because GRAB is losing money.   
  
  
Taking ComfortDelGro (Traditional Taxi) and Kakao (Superapp) as reference for how much the margins should be for GRAB.  
Kakao’s EBIT margins for FY21 and 22 is 9.7% and 8.2% respectively.  
“ComfortDelGro’s taxi earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin is…15.6% in 2019” ([SOURCE](https://sbr.com.sg/transport-logistics/news/comfortdelgro-taxis-profit-margin-shrinks-2-in-2020-maybank-kim-eng))  
Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB's main business of being a ride hailing app.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

Taxes, GRAB's taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%. GRAB is based on the Cayman islands, but it does not seem possible for them to avoid taxes and since most of their business operations are done in Southeast Asia, I’d assume they will eventually move to Singapore and pay Singapore taxes.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of ""Adjusted EBITDA"" but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring ""One-Time off transaction"" and in turn rewards managements for beating their ""Adjusted EBITDA"". They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don't like the tale the management constantly spins about ""Adjusted EBITDA"", it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.

999,stocks,"Let's summarize the reasons why INTC is at the current price:

* \- Lagging behind in technology
* \- Poor track record of management
* \- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history
* \- Losing market share in most segments
* \- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues
* \- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush
* \- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days

&amp;#x200B;

Still, let's underline some facts:

**Market valuation landscape:**

* \- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold.
* \- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.

**Strategy:**

Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:

* \- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)
* \- Catching up to TSMC's tech

They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.

Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**

The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.

If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.

We already have positive things to say about their execution:

* \- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.
* \- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.
* \- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.
* \- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irrational fears:**

* \- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:

Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.

* \- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:

Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you for your points of view, they give me more to think about. After all, my goal is to make the most fair case and orient my thoughts, as I see no good or current publication about this.
