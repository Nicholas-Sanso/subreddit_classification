1,stocks,"If you look at the price chart, they have gone nowhere over 5 years but a little lower.

Most of their revenue are from sports game and Ultimate Team microtransactions, which isn't going to help the stock go up because they're just consistent cash cows that are already baked in to everyone's forecast and there's not much upside.

The only studio they have that has a shot of producing new hits that actually provides upside to the stock is Respawn. Apex Legends helped a lot, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was great as well but wasn't enough for this earnings call.

Do not mention DICE since their last blockbuster success was Battlefield 1 in 2018 and every Battlefield after that hasn't been successful. That was 7 years ago.

Besides Respawn &amp; sports games, nothing else matters for EA and I just don't see this stock going anywhere far as an independent company.

The next catalyst is the ATVI acquisition officially closing and should get EA back to the $130s. Then is how does the rebranding of EA's soccer game goes that you'll see during the holidays and as long as people buy the game still since there's no better alternative for soccer, it should stay at $130 and maybe touch $140.

After this I think they need to sell. Take advantage that they'll be the biggest pure-play video game company and with ATVI off the list big tech who wants to catch up with Microsoft should give a bid for EA.

Believe it or not, I wrote this post yesterday at work, circa 3 hours before the news about the company and its shares skyrocketing. I'm from the field so I've heard about the drug for obesity around 3 months ago for the first time. Even though now probably not a good buy due to the momentum and hype, I'll post the original post anyway:

What's your opinion about Novo Nordisk (NVO). It's not the best buy right now and P/E is quite high, but I think the company has amazing moat. Diabetes and especially obesity is something that will keep increasing in incidence and the treatment with pharmacotherapy seems to be a booming field - with NVO already having a successful drug, Eli Lilly developing one, with other players joining the game. Treatment of obesity is supposed to be $100bn business within a decade.

I'm a psychiatrist and I think in our field alone, it's gonna be a game changer (obesity induced by antipsychotics and mood stabilizers). There's already very promising studies published. Then there's people with diabetes alone and general 1/3 of world's population that's... well, fat.

7,stocks,"PayPal has become the first major US fintech company to offer its own crypto token with a dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD. The company is entering an extremely crowded market already dominated by stablecoins like tether and USDC, at a time when the hype over cryptocurrency has largely fizzled and prices have been mostly stable with no big run-ups since 2022. PayPal's chief crypto executive, Jose Fernandez da Ponte, believes that stablecoins are the killer application for blockchains right now. ""Stablecoins are something that we cannot just sit out,"" da Ponte added. PayPal denied a Bloomberg report that the payments processor paused development of its stablecoin in February. The market is primed for new entrants that are fully backed and unlike tether, fully regulated. PayPal's launch comes after crypto liquidity plummeted in the last year and a half. The collapse of the crypto banking trifecta rippled into the stablecoin market, with Circle's USD Coin briefly losing its peg to the U.S. dollar. The total market cap of stablecoins has plunged since its peak, dropping 25% to $120 billion. PayPal's infrastructure, including being regulated in multiple countries, risk management, and compliance, is a key asset that is a difference in the approach that the company is taking.  
  
PayPal USD is a stablecoin that is backed by dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and cash equivalents and is redeemable for dollars. It is similar to USDC and is backed by a combination of dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents. The hypothetical digital dollar, CBDC, is a digital twin of the U.S. dollar, fully regulated, under a central authority, and with the full faith and backing of the country's central bank. There are both benefits and drawbacks to these forms, with some arguing that a CBDC in the U.S. would technically be safer than privately issued stablecoins because it would present a direct claim against a central bank. However, many people who deal in stablecoins want an easier way of doing business, especially internationally. PayPal is an alternative payments network built on top of the commercial bank system, offering interoperable, transparent, and faster settlement and cross-border settlement.  
  
Stablecoins originally emerged to cater to demand for dollar exposure offshore and overseas, but nongovernmental digital tokens are increasingly being used in domestic and international transactions, which is scary for central banks. PayPal's chief crypto executive, Nic Carter, believes the payment processor has a place in the dollar-pegged stablecoin sector by enlarging the pie and offering a more accessible market.

Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker said Tuesday that the Federal Reserve may be at a point where the central bank can hold interest rates steady and allow previous rate hikes to continue lowering inflation.

That view, he said, is backed up by the latest economic data coupled with discussions with banks.

Two weeks ago, the Fed raised rates for the 11th time to a range of 5.25%-5.5%, in what was thought to be the first of two rate hikes for the remainder of the year.


Harker said he believes the Fed is making progress on bringing inflation down and is encouraged by the latest reading on the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index. Inflation rose 3%, or 4.1% excluding volatile food and energy prices.

""We are making progress against inflation,"" he said. ""It has been slow progress, and I am watchful of any reemerging price pressures. We remain unwavering in our commitment to bring inflation back to target.""

Before the Fed meets again on September 20, the central bank will have a slew of new economic data to consider, with another PCE report, one more employment report, and two CPI reports among them.



Harker says once the Fed moves to hold rates, the central bank will hold rates high for a while.

""The pandemic taught us to never say never, but I do not foresee any likely circumstance for an immediate easing of the policy rate,"" he said.

Harker sees a path to a soft economic landing with a slight uptick in unemployment. He expects core PCE inflation to decline to just below 4% by the end of the year, before falling below 3% next year and leveling out at the Fed’s 2% target in 2025.

***""I do see us on the flight path to the soft landing we all hope for and that has proved quite elusive in the past,"" Harker added.***

In a major sports betting deal, ESPN has cut a $2 billion deal with casino owner Penn Entertainment to launch ESPN Bet, a branded sportsbook. ESPN Bet will launch this fall in the 16 states where Penn has sports betting licenses. It will replace the Barstool Sportsbook. Penn is paying ESPN $1.5 billion in cash over the 10-year term, with another $500 million in warrants that will vest over the term “in exchange for media, marketing services, brand and other rights provided by ESPN.” According to the terms of the deal, Penn will get the rights to the ESPN brand (for betting purposes) for 10 years, with the option to extend for another 10 years with mutual agreement. ESPN programs will promote the service, with some ESPN talent being involved as well. ESPN will also be able to designate a Penn board member after three years.

In connection with the deal, Penn will sell Barstool Sports, which it acquired in 2020. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy is the buyer of the brand, and there is a non-compete clause among other restrictive covenants. Penn will also “receive 50% of the gross proceeds” if there is a subsequent sale of Barstool. “Our primary focus is always to serve sports fans and we know they want both betting content and the ability to place bets with less friction from within our products,” said Jimmy Pitaro, chairman of ESPN, in a statement. “The strategy here is simple: to give fans what they’ve been requesting and expecting from ESPN.

**Why the Stock Dropped:**
The decline in Datadog's stock can be attributed to the company's revenue forecast falling short of expectations for the rest of the year.

Although Q2 results showed improvements and topped expectations, the Q3 and full-year outlook missed analyst forecasts, causing investor concerns and leading to the 20% drop in the stock.

**Q3 Forecast:**
- **Revenue:** $521 million to $525 million (below consensus of $536 million).
- **Adjusted EPS:** 33 to 35 cents (above consensus of 29 cents).

**Full-Year Outlook:**
- **Revenue:** $2.05 billion to $2.06 billion (analysts expected $2.24 billion).
- **Adjusted EPS:** $1.30 to $1.34 (analysts expected $1.18).

**Q2 Performance:**
- **Net Loss:** $4.0 million, improving from a loss of $4.88 million YoY.
- **Adjusted EPS:** 36 cents (analysts expected 28 cents).
- **Revenue:** $509.5 million, up 25% YoY (above consensus of $501.6 million).

**Customers:** Around **2,990** customers with annual recurring revenue over $100,000.

The company's $8.31 billion in sales for the quarter marked a 28% increase from the same period a year ago. 

## Drug results

Revenue growth was also driven by sales of breast cancer pill Verzenio, which rose 57% to $926.8 million for the quarter. Sales of Jardiance, a tablet that lowers blood sugar in Type 2 diabetes patients, climbed 45% to $668.3 million for the second quarter.

Newer drugs like Mounjaro, the company's Type 2 diabetes injection, also fueled revenue growth, posting $979.7 million in sales for the quarter. The drug was first approved in the U.S. in May 2022 and notched just $16 million in sales in the year-ago period. 

Investors have pinned high hopes on Mounjaro's potential mega-blockbuster trajectory beyond diabetes, with some research suggesting that it may be even more effective at reducing weight than Novo Nordisk's popular Wegovy and Ozempic injections.

Last month, Eli Lilly filed for Food and Drug Administration approval of the injection for chronic weight management.

Eli Lilly said it ""has experienced and continues to expect intermittent delays fulfilling orders of certain Mounjaro doses given significant demand.""

## Pipeline and acquisitions

Eli Lilly's stock has been on a tear in recent months, driven in part by positive trial results for its Alzheimer's drug, donanemab, and the company's progress with its promising obesity drug pipeline.

Shares of Eli Lilly are up more than 24% for the year. With a market value of roughly $431 billion, Eli Lilly is the second-largest pharmaceutical company based in the U.S. after Johnson &amp; Johnson.

Eli Lilly in July announced a $1.93 billion deal to buy Versanis, a privately held obesity drug maker.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly on Tuesday raised its full-year guidance as second-quarter profit jumped 85% from the same period a year ago on strong sales from the pharmaceutical giant&amp;#39;s diabetes treatment Mounjaro and other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company now expects full-year revenue of between $33.4 billion and $33.9 billion, up from a previous forecast of $31.2 billion to $31.7 billion. Eli Lilly also increased its adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $9.70 to $9.90 per share for the year, up from a range of $8.65 to $8.85.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Eli Lilly surged 14% Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

The firm lowered the ratings of 10 banks by one rung, while major lenders Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, State Street, Truist Financial, Cullen/Frost Bankers and Northern Trust are now under review for a potential downgrade.

Moody’s also changed its outlook to negative for 11 banks, including Capital One, Citizens Financial and Fifth Third Bancorp.

Among the smaller lenders receiving an official ratings downgrade were M&amp;T Bank, Pinnacle Financial, BOK Financial and Webster Financial

“U.S. banks continue to contend with interest rate and asset-liability management (ALM) risks with implications for liquidity and capital, as the wind-down of unconventional monetary policy drains systemwide deposits and higher interest rates depress the value of fixed-rate assets,” Moody’s analysts Jill Cetina and Ana Arsov said in the accompanying research note.

“Meanwhile, many banks’ Q2 results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital. This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline from solid but unsustainable levels, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios.”

Regional U.S. banks were thrust into the spotlight earlier this year after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank triggered a run on deposits across the sector. The panic eventually spread to Europe and resulted in the emergency rescue of Swiss giant Credit Suisse by domestic rival UBS.

# [Stock futures fall with bank shares under pressure from Moody’s downgrade: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/07/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures retreated Tuesday as a decline in bank shares dampened investor sentiment.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked lower by 191 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.5% each.
*****
&gt; Bank shares fell broadly after Moody’s downgraded the credit rating on several banks, including M&amp;T Bank and Pinnacle Financial. The credit agency also placed Bank of N.Y. Mellon and State Street on review for a downgrade.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase traded lower in the premarket. The SPDR S&amp;P Bank ETF (KBE) slipped 2.3% in the premarket, while the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) dipped 2%.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continued. UPS shares dropped more than 5% after the delivery giant reported weaker-than-expected revenue for the second quarter. The company also lowered its full-year revenue outlook. Educational tech company Chegg popped about 23% after reporting second-quarter revenue of $183 million, beating analysts’ estimate of $177 million, per Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; The corporate earnings season has so far been better-than-expected. Roughly 86% of S&amp;P 500 stocks have reported quarterly results, and nearly 80% of them have beaten Wall Street’s expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; “The good news is that the earnings trough/recession is likely coming to an end, with earnings growth expected to accelerate over the coming quarters,” said Dylan Kremer, co-chief investment officer at Certuity. “Looking ahead, earnings projections seem a bit lofty to us relative to revenue growth estimates, particularly starting in Q1/24.”
*****
&gt; On the economic data front, traders are looking ahead to July’s consumer price index report, out Thursday. The inflation metric could put Wall Street’s belief in a soft landing to the test. Economists polled by Dow Jones are calling for a monthly increase of 0.2% in July and a year-over-year rise of 3.3%.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a strong performance Monday. The 30-stock Dow surged more than 400 points, or nearly 1.2%, for its best day since June 15. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%, and S&amp;P 500 closed higher by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 broke four-straight sessions of losses.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, August 8th, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Tuesday, August the 8th, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/07/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall with bank shares under pressure from Moody’s downgrade: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock futures retreated Tuesday as a decline in bank shares dampened investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked lower by 191 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.5% each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank shares fell broadly after Moody’s downgraded the credit rating on several banks, including M&amp;amp;T Bank and Pinnacle Financial. The credit agency also placed Bank of N.Y. Mellon and State Street on review for a downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase traded lower in the premarket. The SPDR S&amp;amp;P Bank ETF (KBE) slipped 2.3% in the premarket, while the SPDR S&amp;amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) dipped 2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings season continued. UPS shares dropped more than 5% after the delivery giant reported weaker-than-expected revenue for the second quarter. The company also lowered its full-year revenue outlook. Educational tech company Chegg popped about 23% after reporting second-quarter revenue of $183 million, beating analysts’ estimate of $177 million, per Refinitiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corporate earnings season has so far been better-than-expected. Roughly 86% of S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks have reported quarterly results, and nearly 80% of them have beaten Wall Street’s expectations, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The good news is that the earnings trough/recession is likely coming to an end, with earnings growth expected to accelerate over the coming quarters,” said Dylan Kremer, co-chief investment officer at Certuity. “Looking ahead, earnings projections seem a bit lofty to us relative to revenue growth estimates, particularly starting in Q1/24.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the economic data front, traders are looking ahead to July’s consumer price index report, out Thursday. The inflation metric could put Wall Street’s belief in a soft landing to the test. Economists polled by Dow Jones are calling for a monthly increase of 0.2% in July and a year-over-year rise of 3.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is coming off a strong performance Monday. The 30-stock Dow surged more than 400 points, or nearly 1.2%, for its best day since June 15. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%, and S&amp;amp;P 500 closed higher by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&amp;amp;P 500 broke four-straight sessions of losses.&lt;/p&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

’s chief financial officer, Zach Kirkhorn, stepped down from his position, effective Aug. 4, the automaker announced Monday morning in a regulatory filing. Tesla’s chief accounting officer Vaibhav Taneja was appointed as the new CFO and will hold both roles concurrently.

Shares of Tesla were trading down about 2.5% on the news.

Kirkhorn will stay on with Tesla through the end of the year to assist in the transition, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Kirkhorn had served as CFO since March 2019 and had worked for Tesla since 2010.

“As I shift my responsibilities to support this transition, I want to thank the talented, passionate, and hard-working employees at Tesla, who have accomplished things many thought not possible,” Kirkhorn wrote on LinkedIn.

Kirkhorn’s departure marks the second CFO replacement at Tesla in just over four years. When prior CFO Deepak Ahuja left Tesla in 2019, shares dipped as much as 4.5%.

Vaibhav Taneja, Kirkhorn’s replacement and Tesla’s former chief accounting officer, has been with the automaker since 2017.

I have a questions regarding IRA Contributions, gains and associated taxes. I read that any contributions I make are withdrawable tax-free at any time. Any gains I make in that account are withdrawable tax-free only after I have owned the account for 5 years AND after I am over 59.5 years old


Main question: are any gains non-taxable after the criteria are met? If I kept depositing 1k a year from age 30, but my account value at age 60 is 200k, I withdraw the entire 200k free of any tax? No income, capital gains, nothing?



Second scenario: I contribute 1k from age 30 to 34, so 4k total. In this time, trading stocks, options, whatever, the total value has become 8k, so a total 4k gain. Can I withdraw 4k ( my contribution) tax-free, and leave the other 4k in the account to just grow till I'm 59.5?

Now, I can't withdraw a single cent before the age of 59.5 without paying taxes - right?

The U.S. Federal Reserve will likely need to raise interest rates further to bring down inflation, Governor Michelle Bowman said on Saturday. Bowman said she supported the Fed’s quarter-point increase in interest rates last month, given still-high inflation, strong consumer spending, a rebound in the housing market and a labor market that is helping to feed higher prices. “I also expect that additional rate increases will likely be needed to get inflation on a path down to the FOMC’s 2 percent target,” she said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Kansas Bankers Association, referring to the Fed’s rate-setting panel, the Federal Open Market Committee.

Monetary policy is not on a “preset course,” she also said, and data will drive future decisions. “We should remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting if the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled.” Bowman has frequently expressed views that are more hawkish than some of her colleagues. In forecasts published in June, most Fed policymakers expected to end the year with the Fed policy rate at 5.6%, one quarter-point hike above the setting established at the Fed’s late-July meeting. Bowman’s use of the plural “rate increases” in her remarks on Saturday indicates she thinks the Fed will need to go higher than that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/05/feds-bowman-says-more-us-rate-hikes-likely-will-be-needed.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/05/feds-bowman-says-more-us-rate-hikes-likely-will-be-needed.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

70,stocks,"Basically I started investing in August 2021. Created an account with $5000 on Fidelity, but really did not know what I was doing (I still don’t really) so I just invested in companies I knew and things that I thought sounded cool. Invested $1000 each in Microsoft, Google, and Fidelity 500 Index Fund, and $500 each in TAN (solar energy) and FAN (wind energy). I left my remaining $1000 in Fidelity Government Money Market Fund. 

Basically 2022 was horrible to me, like for most people. Lost more than $1000 at the worst point, but didn’t sell anything. Right now I’m at around $4800. What I’m conflicted about is that I want to invest for the long term, but I still haven’t broken even.

But I also don’t want to keep waiting in vain as I slowly lose even more money. So I guess what I’m asking for are some opinions on the future of solar and wind stocks.

Invested $1000 each in Microsoft, Google, and Fidelity 500 Index Fund, and $500 each in TAN (solar energy) and FAN (wind energy). I left my remaining $1000 in Fidelity Government Money Market Fund. &lt;/p&gt;

71,stocks,"This week's casual valuation is **HelloFresh**. I've received many requests to cover it as it is one of the largest positions in my portfolio (13.5%).

In this post, I'll share everything that there's to share from my side, but please do not treat this as financial/investment advice. If you want to make any decision, please do your homework.

The post will be divided into the following segments:

* Introduction
* The business model
* Historical financial performance
* The balance sheet
* The 2025 target (provided by the management)
* Assumptions &amp; valuation
* Valuation based on assumptions different than mine

**Introduction**

For those who are not familiar, HelloFresh is a company operating in a niche market. It is a direct-to-consumers company, that delivers meal kits &amp; ready-to-eat meals.

**A meal kit** is a combination of a recipe and all the ingredients required to make the meal. Once a week, the customer can choose the recipes, and everything gets delivered in a box to their doorstep.

**A ready-to-eat-meal**, is well, pretty much the same, except there's no cooking to be done.

Other than its own brand HelloFresh, it has acquired other smaller companies in the past, such as Factor\_, Green Chef, Chef's Plate, and YouFoodz. These are companies that operate in the same industry, and the company uses its know-how to scale them up, by increasing capacity, but also expanding in other countries.

Other than selling meals, it also sells soups, desserts, bakery products, salads, etc.

A tiny portion of their revenue comes in the form of fees for including some marketing material of other companies (offering discounts for example) in the box sent to the final customer. This is not a significant portion, but the margins are 100%. Adding a couple of flyers in a box doesn't take that much space, and other companies would pay to target a certain geographical area for their products/services.

&amp;#x200B;

**The business model**

The company operates based on a pull model, meaning the first step is done by the customers, choosing the recipes, and placing the order. Between that day, and the delivery (in the Netherlands, the deadline for ordering is Wednesday, and delivery is being done during the weekend), HelloFresh:

* Orders all the ingredients
* Gets all the ingredients delivered to their fulfillment centers
* Orders are being packaged &amp; sorted for delivery

There has been a lot of investment done in automation in advanced assembly lines, so the fulfillment centers are in pretty good shape.

The capex reached its peak in 2022 and is expected to decrease every year over the next 3 years. The main reason for this is the infrastructure that is already in place as it is sufficient to support €10b in revenue (the last twelve months' revenue is €8b).

There are 7.1m customers (assuming 1 customer = 1 household), representing roughly a 2% penetration rate, comparing it against the 322m households in the countries where the company operates. A high penetration rate should not be assumed, as this is a very niche market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

The company has roughly €8b in revenue (vs. €4.3b market cap), with a gross margin of 26%. The direct costs are related to:

* Ingredients
* Packaging
* Delivery

After taking the marketing &amp; G&amp;A expenses into account, the operating margin is around 3%. So, why would I invest in a company of this kind?

I expect the margins, and the free cash flow to grow. Here's my rationale:

If you take a look at the 3 direct costs, it can be argued that **ingredients and packaging** will grow hand in hand with the more orders the company has, leading to higher gross profit, but same margins.

However, **delivery** doesn't grow at the same pace. Imagine if one of their vans needs to transport 10 packages to one neighborhood, Now, if the same van has to transport 12 packages, the cost would not increase by 20%. The van has already made the majority of the journey.

This means, **the more customers there are in a certain geographical region, the higher the margins are**. In the mature markets where the company operates, the operating margin is between **8%-10%** (in some, the operating margin is even 12%, but this is too high to use for long-term assumptions).

I am a customer of HelloFresh, this is how I got introduced to this public company. If someone is happy with the product/service, there's no additional marketing expense required to keep them satisfied. Therefore, I expect the marketing expense to decrease as % of revenue over time. The management shared the 2025 targets, and we'll come back to this.

&amp;#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

The company has almost €0.5b in cash, which is solid, with very low accounts receivable (€17m) which is expected, as the customers pay almost at the same time as the delivery. This means the company has almost no risk of not getting paid.

In addition, as there operate in order cycles, they hold very little inventory (€250m), consisting of fresh ingredients and packaging materials.

On the other side of the balance sheet, it is worth mentioning that they have around €0.7b in debt, including leases, as they lease some of the fulfillment centers in the US, Sweden, Canada, Australia, and the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

**The 2025 target**

The management shared the 2025 targets, and the summary is as follows:

* Revenue growth to €10b
* Gross profit 26% --&gt; 29%
* Marketing expense (as % of revenue) 18% --&gt; 16%
* Operating profit 3% --&gt; 8%

Today, we have a company with low profitability and high capex (to increase its capacity), and as of 2024/2025, we'll have a company with modest profitability and much lower capex. Based on my assumptions, I expect a significant increase in the free cash flow.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumptions &amp; Valuation**

However, only because the management has certain targets, doesn't mean that is exactly what is going to happen.

My assumptions are more conservative:

* **Revenue growth** of 5% for the next year, reducing to 2.5% over time (the €10b revenue target of the management is hit in 2028)
* **Operating margin** slowly improving, reaching 8% in 2027
* **A discount rate** of 8.7%

After adjusting for what is on their balance sheet, as well as the equity options outstanding, the value of HelloFresh is roughly €6b (€34.5/share).

For comparison, the company's market cap is €4.3b (€24.5/share).

Based on my assumptions, the IRR that the company offers is **12.7%.**

For those who are interested in multiples, based on my assumptions, at year 10, the terminal value is multiple of the FCF at year 10 x 17.8.

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**

Of course, the future is uncertain and my assumptions could be significantly wrong. Let's take a look at how the valuation (per share) changes if we use different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue / Operating margin|6%|8%|10%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|40% (€10.8b)|€23.0|€32.7|€41.3|
|51% (€11.6b)|€23.9|**€34.5**|€43.5|
|100% (€15.4b)|€27.7|€41.4|€53.7|

The €34.5 is the fair value based on my assumptions. If you take a look at the sensitivity, for example, the 6% operating margin column, there's not that much difference if the company grows by 40% over the next decade, or by 100% (€23.0 vs. €27.7).

However, if you take a look at the first row, the valuation changes significantly. As this is a low-margin business, one of the main tasks of the management is to expand margins.

Therefore, the main risk around the company is its margins. If the management doesn't succeed to expand the margins, the impact on the valuation is significant.

My rationale is that as the company gets more customers in the existing geographical regions, the costs per order will decrease. In addition, the reduced marketing expense (as % of revenue) and reduced capex will increase the FCF significantly over the next two years.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#39;s casual valuation is &lt;strong&gt;HelloFresh&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ingredients&lt;/li&gt;

73,stocks,"The pandemic showered Pfizer with record sales. Now the end of the crisis is dragging the drugmaker down.

Its Covid-19 vaccine and drug powered Pfizer to more than $100 billion in sales last year, the first drugmaker to break the barrier. Shares soared, as Wall Street hailed the company for its savvy, fast and ultimately lucrative pivot to taking on the virus.

But many people have moved on from the pandemic. Sales from the two products dropped so much, so rapidly they contributed to Pfizer’s overall sales falling sizably in its most recent quarter compared with the period a year earlier. The company dialed back the top end of its expectations for the full-year performance.

Shares are down 31% this year to date, a loss of more than $88 billion in market capitalization. The company’s valuation has dropped by $144 billion since its 2021 peak.

Pfizer is hitting a rough spot after its Covid-19 sales nosedived and while it waits for new drugs and recent deal-making to pay off. Adding to the straits: the loss of an estimated $17 billion in annual sales by the end of the decade, when some of the company’s biggest sellers, like arthritis treatment Xeljanz, lose patent protection. 

The New York-based company has talked up plans to increase revenue through a bevy of new drug approvals and their launches. It also has been using its Covid-19 cash to secure other products for its lineup. It predicts more than $10 billion in 2030 sales from its $43 billion proposed deal to buy cancer-drug biotech Seagen, as it leans more into cancer drugs. 

Executives also have other dials they can turn to tune up the company’s performance, such as cutting costs and some drug research programs.

Yet executing means Pfizer must overcome factors outside its control. The Federal Trade Commission is reviewing the agreement to buy Seagen, while drugs in late-stage development must pass testing and get green lights from the Food and Drug Administration.

And Pfizer’s ambitious expectations for launches of new products might be difficult to pull off in today’s tightfisted healthcare environment.

Pfizer has “gotten a lot of things over the finish line, and there’s still some more to go, but they’re asking a lot of those products to contribute in a relatively narrow time frame before year end,” Barclays analyst Carter Gould said. 

Sales of drugs from recent acquisitions, including migraine drug Nurtec and sickle-cell disease treatment Oxbryta, have been slow to accumulate, said Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger. “The market demand has been somewhat softer than expected for both of them,” he said.

The predicament is customary for big pharmaceutical companies, which regularly confront the ups and downs of patent-dependent franchises. Pfizer has plenty of experience navigating through sales drops for impotence pill Viagra, cholesterol fighter Lipitor and other erstwhile juggernauts.

Playing a role this time is Pfizer’s decision to slim down and become a growth stock. Before the pandemic hit, the drugmaker had shed slower-growing businesses, losing the cushion of their steady cash flows, to focus on higher-growth but more volatile prescription drugs.

The strategy paid off handsomely during the pandemic. Shares reached a record high of roughly $61 in December 2021 as the Omicron variant spread throughout the world and Pfizer shipped billions of Covid-19 shots. Pfizer developed the shot with Germany’s BioNTech.

The return to Earth has been abrupt. Earlier this year, Pfizer said it expects its Covid-19 vaccine to generate $13.5 billion in sales in 2023, down roughly two-thirds from last year. The company said its Paxlovid antiviral would bring in about $8 billion in sales this year, down 58% from last year. 

Sales for the products are lower this year because governments have purchased fewer contracts and the U.S. is transitioning to a commercial market. Doctors are also writing fewer Paxlovid prescriptions. 

“A key driver will be the magnitude of the next Covid wave and whether it drives people to be vaccinated at a higher rate or not,” Risinger said. “Covid fatigue and vaccine hesitancy adds additional uncertainty about what the future demand will be for Covid vaccinations.” 

Pfizer said last week, when reporting quarterly earnings, that it should have more clarity on future demand for its pandemic products by the end of the year. By then, it will have rolled out its latest Covid-19 shot through the traditional commercial market. 

Should sales fail to materialize, Pfizer is prepared to trim R&amp;D spending for Covid-19 and other disease areas, Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in an interview.  

“We are moving post-Covid,” Bourla said.

Pfizer lowered its growth-rate target for this year, citing the FDA’s decision to approve a cancer drug for a smaller patient population than the company expected and the federal government’s recommendation for a new RSV vaccine falling short of company expectations.

Recent damage from a tornado to a North Carolina manufacturing plant might also jeopardize sales, Chief Financial Officer David Denton said. 

To date this year, the FDA has approved four Pfizer medicines. The company is more than halfway through its goal of rolling out 19 new drugs or expanded uses over 18 months through the first half of 2024. 

An experimental multiple myeloma drug called elranatamab that is up for FDA approval could generate about $1 billion in sales in 2030, according to Jefferies analyst Akash Tewari.

&lt;p&gt;Its Covid-19 vaccine and drug powered Pfizer to more than $100 billion in sales last year, the first drugmaker to break the barrier. Shares soared, as Wall Street hailed the company for its savvy, fast and ultimately lucrative pivot to taking on the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many people have moved on from the pandemic. Sales from the two products dropped so much, so rapidly they contributed to Pfizer’s overall sales falling sizably in its most recent quarter compared with the period a year earlier. The company dialed back the top end of its expectations for the full-year performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares are down 31% this year to date, a loss of more than $88 billion in market capitalization. The company’s valuation has dropped by $144 billion since its 2021 peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is hitting a rough spot after its Covid-19 sales nosedived and while it waits for new drugs and recent deal-making to pay off. Adding to the straits: the loss of an estimated $17 billion in annual sales by the end of the decade, when some of the company’s biggest sellers, like arthritis treatment Xeljanz, lose patent protection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company has talked up plans to increase revenue through a bevy of new drug approvals and their launches. It also has been using its Covid-19 cash to secure other products for its lineup. It predicts more than $10 billion in 2030 sales from its $43 billion proposed deal to buy cancer-drug biotech Seagen, as it leans more into cancer drugs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executives also have other dials they can turn to tune up the company’s performance, such as cutting costs and some drug research programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet executing means Pfizer must overcome factors outside its control. The Federal Trade Commission is reviewing the agreement to buy Seagen, while drugs in late-stage development must pass testing and get green lights from the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Pfizer’s ambitious expectations for launches of new products might be difficult to pull off in today’s tightfisted healthcare environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has “gotten a lot of things over the finish line, and there’s still some more to go, but they’re asking a lot of those products to contribute in a relatively narrow time frame before year end,” Barclays analyst Carter Gould said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales of drugs from recent acquisitions, including migraine drug Nurtec and sickle-cell disease treatment Oxbryta, have been slow to accumulate, said Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger. “The market demand has been somewhat softer than expected for both of them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predicament is customary for big pharmaceutical companies, which regularly confront the ups and downs of patent-dependent franchises. Pfizer has plenty of experience navigating through sales drops for impotence pill Viagra, cholesterol fighter Lipitor and other erstwhile juggernauts.&lt;/p&gt;

In the past year, the company has faced challenges in improving its income. Despite experiencing a 20% decrease in revenue (without accounting for the 100% inflation rate) during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the previous quarter, and with expenses rising between 9% to 17%, the company managed to report a positive operating income. Notably, they had an unusually high CAPEX due to the acquisition of ""Central Costanera,"" which contributes approximately 3% of Argentina's installed capacity.We all acknowledge that the Argentine energy sector has been an unattractive investment due to the government's restrictive regulatory framework, resulting in insufficient investments to meet the country's energy demands. However, there are promising signs of potential change in this regard.  

Firstly, the outlook for Argentina's political future is highly optimistic. The recent announcements of presidential candidates from both major political parties, advocating a shift towards a free market economy and emphasizing the independence of the Argentine central bank from the treasury, have had a profound impact on the markets. As evidenced by the 30% surge in Argentine bonds in June, there is a growing positive sentiment and increased investor confidence in the potential direction of the country's economy.  

Secondly, Argentina's recent agreement with the IMF will provide the country with an additional credit of 7.5 billion dollars. This new arrangement indicates that the IMF will likely impose conditions aimed at achieving fiscal surpluses and implementing monetary tightening, with the ultimate goal of reducing inflation rates.

My main idea is that given the political shift towards a free market economy and the challenging stagflation in the Argentine economy, the new president will likely be compelled to make a 180-degree turn in economic policies. This shift may involve measures to reduce the fiscal deficit and control inflation through some form of exchange rate stabilization.

79,stocks,"**About the company**  
  
Cactus Inc. (WHD) makes and sells wellheads and pressure control equipment to the oil and gas industry. It also sells flexible piping through its FlexSteel unit. The company was founded in 2011. It currently has a market cap of $4.11 billion and pays a 0.85% dividend.   
  
**Management**  
  
The CEO, Scott Bender, is a co-founder of the company and has been CEO for its entire existence. His brother Joel is also an executive and has been with the company sincere co-founded it. Management owns about 20% of the company, so they are aligned with shareholder interests.  
  
**Segments and growth**  
  
Cactus is a critical supplier for oilfield operations. They make and install well heads for new oil wells. Their technology makes the process safer and more efficient than the competition. Once cactus installs their pressure systems they collect servicing fees for the life of the well. They also rent equipment to the E&amp;P companies. About 33% of their legacy business comes from these recurring sources and 66% from the wellhead installations.  
  
Earlier this year, Cactus acquired Flexsteel, a maker of flexible pipe. This allows them access to a tangential market and has been immediately accretive to free cash flow.  
  
Cactus has several growth tailwinds. The flex steel acquisition is still being integrated into the company. This will continue to add free cash flow to the balance sheet. US oil drillers are going strong and Cactus will keep getting revenue from their operations. Also, Cactus is developing products for new markets. They are branching into carbon sequestration too. They opened their first sequestration project in 2022 and have several more in the works. They are also making efforts to leverage Flex steel to get into the midstream market and, more importantly, into offshore drilling. The offshore drilling market is projected to grow at a 7-8% CAGR for the next decade plus, so this is a big growth opportunity for the company. They currently have limited offshore offerings.  
  
Lastly, the company authorized a $100 million buyback plan. This will benefit investors if they can continue it longer term, and based on their cash flows, this is likely.  
  
**Performance and balance sheet**  
  
WHD currently has a ROE of 21% with a five year average of 34%. Its current ROIC is 18% with a five year average of 22%. Both those averages are skewed by huge numbers in 2018 and low figures in 2020. This is reflective of the cyclical nature of the energy sector. Their 2020 ROE was around 10%, which isn’t too bad for an oil services company in a pandemic. I’d consider the company to be a good allocator of capital.   
  
The company has a solid balance sheet. Total debt is $189.81 million, which is less than 1 year of free cash flow.  This level of debt is easily manageable, even in a downturn. Much of the debt was due to their Flex steel acquisition and will be paid down.

**Risks**

Like most energy related businesses, Cactus is at the risk of the commodity cycles. If oil prices decline there will likely be less investment into wells and Cactus will see its business shrink. The fact that they stayed profitable in 2020 does illustrate the durability of the business though.   
  
**Valuation**  
  
WHD is trading at around 23x current earnings and 15x forward earnings. It has been seeing its earnings rebound consistently since the 2020 lows. Its 5 year p/e range is 6-60 (energy has been volatile). Analysts are forecasting double digit EPS growth going forward, but this is subject to energy prices. It has a PEG of 0.97. A deep recession or a decline in oil prices would definitely be bad for Cactus’ business.   
  
Morningstar has fair value at $59.15 and it has been climbing, making the stock slightly undervalued even after its recent run.  I have a fair value in the mid $50s. I don't generally share my fair value assumptions since they are, well, assumptions and I'd urge anyone interested to use their own numbers as well. The stock has been on a run recently too, so there is a risk of a pullback soon. The company will also be releasing earnings on August 7th which could cause additional volitility.  
  
If you believe that oil will be a booming market for the foreseeable future, I think that shares are well priced. Cactus is a company that is founder led and management has a large stake in its success. With high ROE and new products coming to market, I think Cactus can continue to grow.

I currently have no stake in WHD.

&lt;p&gt;Morningstar has fair value at $59.15 and it has been climbing, making the stock slightly undervalued even after its recent run.  I have a fair value in the mid $50s. I don&amp;#39;t generally share my fair value assumptions since they are, well, assumptions and I&amp;#39;d urge anyone interested to use their own numbers as well. The stock has been on a run recently too, so there is a risk of a pullback soon. The company will also be releasing earnings on August 7th which could cause additional volitility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe that oil will be a booming market for the foreseeable future, I think that shares are well priced. Cactus is a company that is founder led and management has a large stake in its success. With high ROE and new products coming to market, I think Cactus can continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

What do we think of these? 

Opendoor/Offerpad (OPEN/OPAD) there is definitely some value in iBuying I think. (iBuying is where a company buys a home to flip for profit). Zillow and Redfin ended their iBuying businesses, so obviously iBuying is a super risky, capital heavy business model. But if there’s a company that can figure out how to do it profitably then the sky is the limit.  There’s just too much bullshit in trying to sell a home with all the fees, listing it for sale, scheduling tours, etc.  There’s definitely going to be a good number of people who just want to skip the bullshit and receive a fair cash offer for their home to sell it the next day, especially people who need to sell quickly. All real estate stocks have gotten crushed because people are afraid of an imminent real estate market crash, but if we can look past the upcoming crash, and  if Opendoor or offerpad are still around and prove that iBuying is legit, then these will easily be 10x returns or more. This is a asymmetric risk play 

Redfin (RDFN)- sort of a hedge to Opendoor/ Offerpad since they ended their iBuying business. After the real estate market gets crushed and recovers, they should do well. They have the lowest fees for selling I house I think. 

Ginkgo Bioworks (DNA) - Cathy Wood’s favorite penny stock. They basically program cells for all sorts or products, vaccines, and foods. Seems like they have a bunch of partnerships. Once they engineer living cells for clients they store the cell’s design in a database or foundry to sell to other clients or build, test, and automate more organism engineering. Could be the amazon of biotech or the AWS of biological engineering. 

Matterport (MTTR) - they make those machines that take 3D scans of a building or home to make a “digital twin”. Used a lot for real estate agents selling homes which might do well after real estate demand picks up. There are other products like it, but it’s seems like the hardware/software has the best reputation. They store all the “digital twins” in a database that they could possibly monetize well someday. The “digital twins” should work well in the Metaverse as we digitally recreate the physical world. I know Metaverse was the hype buzzword from 2022 that was replaced by the AI buzzword this year, but hopefully the metaverse is still on its way. I mean apple is releasing its headset next year 

Riot platforms / Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA/RIOT): these are Bitcoin miners. We might look back 5-10 years from now and realize that bitcoin/Ethereum is a scam or vaporware, but the price action from the last year or two is right in-line with previous bitcoin cycles as we get closer to the bitcoin having next year. If bitcoin/ethereum achieve even half of its mission or intended purpose in the long term then these stocks should be multi-baggers, right? 

Chargepoint/ EvGo(CHPT/EVGO): I mean don’t we need as many charging stations as possible for our electric vehicle future?  Do we really think Tesla will be the only prevalent charging station network? 

Enphase (ENPH): I mean, would any of us not install solar panels on our homes at the right price? I feel like this will fall to the $120 support level after that last earnings report but then proceed to 10x over the next decade

101,stocks,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 7th, 2023.

# **S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq tumble for four straight days, notch worst weeks since March: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/03/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slumped Friday for a fourth straight session, and notched their worst weeks since March, as traders seemed to book profits following the latest corporate earnings releases and U.S. jobs data.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.53% to finish at 4,478.03, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.36% to settle at 13,909.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 150.27 points, or 0.43%, to end at 35,065.62.
*****
&gt; All the major indexes reversed earlier gains during afternoon trading, and finished the week with losses. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P dropped about 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively, to notch their worst weeks since March. The Dow edged down 1.1%.
*****
&gt; “People this week seem more respectful of risk than they were before,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, adding that “lots of bears have been capitulating, which is often a sign that we’re closer to the end of a rally than the beginning.”
*****
&gt; After being lower on the day, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) rose to trade above 16 — pointing to investors adding volatility protection.
*****
&gt; Friday marked the final day of what’s been the busiest week of second-quarter earnings season. Amazon jumped 8.3% to its highest level in nearly a year after trouncing expectations on profit and offering positive guidance. Apple lost 4.8% after reporting lower revenue than the year-ago quarter. Both tech giants reported results late Thursday.
*****
&gt; In a sign of the boom in travel and services demand, Booking Holdings gained 7.9% on stronger-than-expected results. Amgen popped 5.5% on solid earnings and a boosted guidance.
*****
&gt; Earnings reports this season for the quarter ended in June have continued to surprise some Wall Street analysts as the expected slowdown in profits proves less than feared. About 84% of S&amp;P 500 companies have given results, with 80% surpassing Wall Street expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield also pulled back from a multimonth high to 4.04%. Its rise in recent sessions had pressured risk assets.
*****
&gt; # A cooler jobs report

&gt; Investors also received more clues into the state of the labor market with Friday’s payrolls report. The data showed 187,000 jobs added in July, less than the 200,000 expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. The unemployment rate also ticked lower to 3.5% from 3.6%.
*****
&gt; Despite the cooler headline numbers, average hourly wages pointed toward more inflation and came in ahead of expectations, rising 0.4% for the month, and 4.4% on an annualized basis. That came in slightly ahead of the 0.3% and 4.2% expected, respectively.
*****
&gt; Many on Wall Street had been eagerly awaiting the jobs report and its implications for the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking cycle. About 88% of traders expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its next meeting in September, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; But next week’s consumer price report for July could make an even greater impact on rate expectations, said Wells Fargo’s Christopher Harvey.
*****
&gt; “A hotter-than-expected print is one of the few things that could really start to change the market’s perception of the Fed, and maybe the Fed’s perception as well,” he said. “But today’s job number, I don’t think does much of anything. I think it solidifies people’s view that the Fed is done at this point.”

&gt; # The Economy is Normalizing, and That’s a Good Thing

&gt; The economy created 187,000 jobs in July, slightly softer than the 200,000 that economists expected. The last couple of months were revised lower, and so it’s always helpful to take a 3-month average, which is now running at 218,000. That’s stronger than the pre-pandemic average of 183,000.

&gt; In short, job growth remains strong. You will hear some people heralding this as the onset of a recession, but more likely this is just normalization of the economy rather than weakness. The report aligns with what we wrote in our Mid-Year 2023 Outlook, not to mention the title: “Edging Closer to Normal”.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-payrolls-601x800.png))**

&gt; The private sector created 172,000 jobs in July, up from 128,000 in June. On a sector level, job growth this year has been driven by non-cyclical areas like health care, education, and government. These sectors had lagged in the early recovery, accounting for just 13% of jobs created in 2021, and 25% in 2022. Over the first 7 months of this year, they’ve accounted for more than 50% of jobs created. July didn’t buck that trend, with health care seeing 100,000 jobs created. Government jobs were on the softer side, rising 15,000 in July versus an average of 53,000 between April and June.

&gt; The cyclical areas of the economy, especially construction, manufacturing, and leisure and hospitality, remain on the softer side, with job growth adding up to 34,000 across these three sectors. So far this year, these sectors have accounted for about 20% of job creation (not exactly “weak”), versus 36% in 2022 and 43% in 2021.

&gt; Again, the theme is normalization.

&gt; **The Best Labor Market Since the Late 1990s**

&gt; The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, not far from 50+ year lows of 3.4%. What is amazing is that the unemployment rate is slightly below where it was in June 2023, when the Fed really started to get aggressive with rate hikes.

&gt; The unemployment rate can be impacted by people leaving the labor force (technically defined as those “not looking for work”) and an aging population. I’ve discussed in prior blogs how we can get around this by looking at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e. workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population. Think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you also get around the demographic issue.

&gt; The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio remained at 80.9%. That is higher than at any point since May 2001. It was actually falling at that time, and didn’t recover until now. This is the best indication that the labor market remains very healthy, and probably in the best shape since the late 1990s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-employment-population-ratio-612x800.png))**

&gt; **Bottom Line: All Signs Point to a Strong Economy**

&gt; The US economy runs on consumption, and for that you need income. The good news is that income growth appears to remain strong and looks to be running ahead of inflation. In fact, wage growth rose 0.4% in July. Monthly numbers can be volatile, but the 3-month annualized pace is 4.9%.

&gt; You combine strong wage growth with strong employment, and that translates to strong income gains across the entire economy. Over the last 3 months, overall income growth for all workers is running at a 5.3% annual pace. Meanwhile, headline inflation is running close to 2.0%. The difference between the two tells you how fast incomes are growing after adjusting for inflation, and that’s running above a 3% annual pace over the past 3 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-real-income-growth-584x800.png))** 

&gt; In my opinion, that’s your simplest measure of underlying economic growth and should tell you things are ok. Normalization is not the same as weakness.

&gt; # Sentiment Swings Higher Despite Declines

&gt; Equities have rolled over in the past week with selling hitting a pinnacle when the US government's credit rating was downgraded by Fitch on Wednesday. In spite of this, sentiment has not taken a hit. The latest survey from the AAII showed 49% of respondents reported bullish sentiment which compares to 44.9% the prior week. With nearly half of respondents reporting as optimists, bullish sentiment sits handily above its historical average of 37.5%. In fact, this week marked the ninth in a row with a bullish sentiment reading above the historical average for the longest such streak since one that ended at 13 weeks long in May 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment resulted in bearish sentiment to drop down to 21.3% which marks a 2.8 percentage point decline on the week and resulted in the lowest bearish reading since June 10, 2021 when it was 20.7%. Similar to bullish sentiment, that is the ninth week in a row with a reading below its historical average, and that is the longest streak since July 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; As a result to the increased optimism, the bull-bear spread ticked up from 20.8 last week to 27.7. That is still below the recent high of 29.9 from two weeks ago, but reiterates how investors have an elevated degree of optimism.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; Not all of the gains to bulls came from bears. Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling from 31% to 29.7%. That is in the middle of the past few years' range.

&gt; # Small Dent to Claims

&gt; Initial jobless claims have been trending lower over the past couple of months, reaching a nearly six month low of 221K last week. This week, claims rebounded rising 6K to 227K. Albeit off the strongest readings from last fall, that remains a healthy reading on joblessness.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims are at historically solid levels even if they have come off their best levels. This week, claims dropped to 205K. That is slightly above the readings from the comparable weeks of the year of the past few years (excluding 2020 and 2021 when claims were much more elevated).

&gt; At this point of the year, claims falling is normal as shown in the second chart below. The current week of the year has only seen claims rise week over week 10.7% of the time. That is the sixth most consistent week of declines of the year. Claims will continue to face seasonal tailwinds in the weeks ahead, but that will begin to reverse as summer turns to fall.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims also ticked higher in the latest week's data, reaching 1.7 million. Although higher than 1.69 million the previous week, continuing claims have much more consistently been trending lower recently, and this week's reading did in fact come in below forecasts of 1.705 million.

&gt; # Downgrades Overlooked

&gt; The bottom has dropped out for the major US indices today with the Nasdaq down over 2% and S&amp;P 500 down 1.25% as of this writing. The catalyst has been the downgrade of the United States' credit rating by Fitch from AAA to AA+ . That is the first downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt in almost twelve years and just the second ever. In the charts below, we show the performance of the S&amp;P 500, government debt, commodities, and the US dollar in the year before and the year after the 2011 downgrade.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been rallying in the months leading up to this downgrade, however, back in 2011 the S&amp;P 500 had already begun rolling over by the time S&amp;P downgraded US debt. In the wake of that downgrade, the S&amp;P 500 went on to fully erase all of the prior year's gains. Fortunately, all of those losses were quickly recouped within three months of the downgrade.

&gt; As for Treasuries and other US agency debt, performance over the past few months has been the complete opposite of 2011. Of course, the interest rate environment is also completely different now with Fed Funds 500 bps higher than it was at the time of the last downgrade. That being said, in 2011, Treasury yields were on the decline in the months headed into the downgrade, but contrary to what might have been expected, the downgrade itself did not change that trend. This time around has seen yields on US government debt moving in the opposite direction.

&gt; Bloomberg's broad commodity index has been in a similar boat with the past few months seeing a decline compared to the steady uptrend back in 2011 that was uninterrupted by the downgrade.

&gt; Finally, we would note the downgrade only acted as a longer-term turning point for the dollar. As shown in the bottom right hand chart, both this year and in 2011, the trade weighted dollar was in a downtrend in the year before the downgrade. But right as S&amp;P changed its rating, the dollar turned higher and continued to rise throughout the following year. In fact, one year out it had erased the entirety of the previous year's decline.

&gt; # Stocks Don’t Like August, Now What?

&gt; “Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.” President Dwight D. Eisenhower

&gt; Another month and more strong gains. Make that five months in a row, the S&amp;P 500 finished higher. The S&amp;P 500 is now up close to 20% on the year, just like everyone predicted.

&gt; We came into the year overweight stocks and remain there, so this run has been a lot of fun for us. But honestly, while we’ve been bullish, even we’ve been surprised by how strong markets have been.

&gt; So let’s get the bad news out of the way. The odds are increasing that stocks could finally take some type of a break. Seasonality has worked out perfectly this year. Here’s a chart we shared many, many times, and it said that some of the very best quarters out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle were the three now just behind us. Sure enough, the fourth quarter last year and the first two quarters this year were spectacular for stocks, just like history suggested. Now seasonality is saying to be open to some type of weakness, or at least a break.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-1.gif.png))**

&gt; To be clear, we do not expect major weakness. But we believe a modest pullback of approximately 5% would be perfectly normal. The S&amp;P 500 has closed higher for five consecutive months. And we’re now moving into the austere month of August. August has been a poor performer, ranking worse than only February and September since 1950 and trailing behind only September and December in the last ten years, although still averaging a positive return over both periods. Oh, and right behind August comes September, the weakest month seasonally. So, while the calendar was a tailwind, we believe it is now becoming a near-term headwind.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-2-copy.png))**

&gt; Taking another look at August, when stocks are up more than 17.5% for the year heading into this month, a breather is even more likely. We found 11 previous years (since 1950), this occurred, and August was higher only three times and down 1.1% on average. So the better the year, the worse August does, apparently.

&gt; One of the reasons we were on record for a surprise summer rally was how stocks tended to do when they had a big first month of the year. When the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 5% in January a summer rally tended to occur (check). But we take seasonal warnings as seriously as seasonal support, and now we are in a period of potential seasonal weakness, at least for the near term.

&gt; If stocks experience weakness over the coming months, investors may be surprised and even start projecting the catastrophe many had expected earlier in the year. But keep in mind a pullback in the next couple of months would be entirely normal seasonal behavior. In fact, it may present buying opportunities, or it may simply be a chance to stay the course and remind ourselves that most years see more than three separate 5% pullbacks. Even in a strong year, there will often be bouts of volatility, so we should be ready for it and avoid overreacting. As President Eisenhower said, start planning today.

&gt; Lastly, the S&amp;P 500 closed up five consecutive months yesterday. Historically, stocks have done quite well after similar streaks. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has been up a year later, 26 out of the past 28 times. However, the last time this happened was in June 2021, and that was followed by a drop of nearly 12%. Despite this recent example, the market’s historical strength is likely another indication of higher stock prices in the future.

&gt; All in all, the odds are increasing that stocks could see some seasonal weakness, but we don’t think it will be anything major. In fact, maybe a little breather could be just what the bulls need for an eventual strong end-of-year rally.

&gt; # $10 Trillion Added in Market Cap; 2023's Best and Worst Through July

&gt; The US stock market (using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy) has now seen an increase in market cap of roughly $10 trillion from its bear market low last October through the end of July 2023. As shown below, the peak market cap for the US stock market was $51.5 trillion seen on the first day of 2022. From high to low, total US market cap fell $13.7 trillion during last year's bear, but since then it has risen back up to $47.7 trillion. To get back to new all-time highs, we currently need market cap to rise by roughly $3.8 trillion.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/r3k.png))**

&gt; The average Russell 3,000 stock rose 5.74% in July. There were 813 stocks in the index that rose 10%+ in July, including 29 names that rose 50%+. Below is a table of these 50%+ gainers. Four names rose 100%: PolyMet Mining (PLM), Quantum-Si (QSI), UroGen Pharma (URGN), and Bridgebio Pharma (BBIO). Other notable names on the list of big July winners include Nikola (NKLA), Upstart (UPST), Carvana (CVNA), QuantumScape (QS), Rivian (RIVN), and Riot (RIOT). This list is made up of many of the high-fliers during the post-COVID bull that then got slaughtered during last year's bear.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/rayjuly.png))**

&gt; Through July, the average Russell 3,000 stock was up 18.1% year-to-date. Below is a list of the 35 names that are already up 200%+ on the year. Topping the list is Carvana (CVNA) with a YTD gain of 869% after gaining 77.3% in July. Back in December 2022, CVNA had fallen into the $4s, but it's now back up to the mid-$40s. Next up is Bit Digital (BTBT) with a YTD gain of 638%, followed by Cipher Mining (CIFR), IonQ (IONQ), Riot (RIOT), and Applied Digital (APLD). Similar to the list of July's biggest winners, the biggest winners YTD are many of the names that got hit the hardest last year, with many falling more than 70% during their bear market drawdowns. Carvana, for example, was actually down 98% from its all-time high when it bottomed in 2022, so even after gaining more than 800% this year, it needs to gain another 700% from here to get back to new highs.

&gt; # Key ETF Performance Through July 2023

&gt; The S&amp;P 500-tracking ETF (SPY) finished July up 3.27%, leaving it up 20.62% YTD on a total return basis. The mega-cap Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) gained only slightly more than SPY in July, but it's up more than twice as much as SPY on a YTD basis at +44.5%. The small-cap Russell 2,000 (IWM) did better than large-caps and mid-caps in July with a gain of 6.11%, but IWM is up less than large-caps on a YTD basis at +14.7%. Value and dividend stocks held up well in July and actually outperformed growth for the month, but value is lagging YTD and the DJ Dividend ETF (DVY) is actually down 0.5% on the year.

&gt; Looking at US sectors, Energy (XLE) and Financials (XLF) -- which lagged in the first half of 2023 -- did the best in July, while Health Care (XLV) and Real Estate (XLRE) were up the least. Technology (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) are currently neck and neck on a YTD basis with XLK up 43.94% through July and XLC up just three basis points more at 43.97%.

&gt; Outside of the US, we saw China (ASHR) and Israel (EIS) gain the most in July, while France (EWQ) and Spain (EWP) gained the least. YTD, it's Mexico (EWW) that's currently atop the list of country ETFs with a gain of 42.85%.

&gt; Oil (USO) gained 15%+ in July, while natural gas (UNG) fell 4.2%. Gold (GLD) saw a small monthly gain of 2.3% versus a gain of 8.6% for silver (SLV). Finally, with yields rising again during the month, Treasury ETFs were in the red. Aside from natural gas, the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) is down more than any other asset class in our matrix on a YoY basis with a total return of -12.3%.

&gt; # Dogs of the Dow for the Dog Days of Summer

&gt; With the Dow coming off of a historic winning streak last week, below we check in on performance of the index versus the Dogs of the Dow. The Dogs of a Dow is a stock-picking strategy that invests in the index members with the highest dividend yields at the end of a year holds them through the end of the next year. On a total return basis, the Dow's recent winning streak has been a benefit to both the overall index and the Dogs alike. That said, the gains to the former have brought the index up near 2022 highs on a total return basis while the Dogs of the Dow has much further to go given the overall weakness of dividend-oriented equities recently.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/073123-d1.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we show the returns of this year's Dogs of the Dow and all other individual Dow members. The Dogs of the Dow are host to some of the stocks with the worst performance this year like Verizon (VZ) and Chevron (CVX), however, there are also a couple of big winners like Intel (INTC) which has returned nearly 42% YTD or JPMorgan Chase (JPM) which has nearly posted a 20% return. However, the biggest gains in the index have come from non-Dogs. In fact, the largest gains this year have been from those with the lowest or no dividend yields at the end of last year like Boeing (BA), Salesforce (CRM), or Apple (AAPL).

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and an awesome trading week ahead r/stocks. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Friday evening to all of you here on &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt;! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 7th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq tumble for four straight days, notch worst weeks since March: Live updates - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/03/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slumped Friday for a fourth straight session, and notched their worst weeks since March, as traders seemed to book profits following the latest corporate earnings releases and U.S. jobs data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 shed 0.53% to finish at 4,478.03, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.36% to settle at 13,909.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 150.27 points, or 0.43%, to end at 35,065.62.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the major indexes reversed earlier gains during afternoon trading, and finished the week with losses. The Nasdaq and S&amp;amp;P dropped about 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively, to notch their worst weeks since March. The Dow edged down 1.1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People this week seem more respectful of risk than they were before,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, adding that “lots of bears have been capitulating, which is often a sign that we’re closer to the end of a rally than the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being lower on the day, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) rose to trade above 16 — pointing to investors adding volatility protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday marked the final day of what’s been the busiest week of second-quarter earnings season. Amazon jumped 8.3% to its highest level in nearly a year after trouncing expectations on profit and offering positive guidance. Apple lost 4.8% after reporting lower revenue than the year-ago quarter. Both tech giants reported results late Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sign of the boom in travel and services demand, Booking Holdings gained 7.9% on stronger-than-expected results. Amgen popped 5.5% on solid earnings and a boosted guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings reports this season for the quarter ended in June have continued to surprise some Wall Street analysts as the expected slowdown in profits proves less than feared. About 84% of S&amp;amp;P 500 companies have given results, with 80% surpassing Wall Street expectations, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10-year Treasury yield also pulled back from a multimonth high to 4.04%. Its rise in recent sessions had pressured risk assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;A cooler jobs report&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors also received more clues into the state of the labor market with Friday’s payrolls report. The data showed 187,000 jobs added in July, less than the 200,000 expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. The unemployment rate also ticked lower to 3.5% from 3.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the cooler headline numbers, average hourly wages pointed toward more inflation and came in ahead of expectations, rising 0.4% for the month, and 4.4% on an annualized basis. That came in slightly ahead of the 0.3% and 4.2% expected, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many on Wall Street had been eagerly awaiting the jobs report and its implications for the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking cycle. About 88% of traders expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its next meeting in September, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But next week’s consumer price report for July could make an even greater impact on rate expectations, said Wells Fargo’s Christopher Harvey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A hotter-than-expected print is one of the few things that could really start to change the market’s perception of the Fed, and maybe the Fed’s perception as well,” he said. “But today’s job number, I don’t think does much of anything. I think it solidifies people’s view that the Fed is done at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Economy is Normalizing, and That’s a Good Thing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economy created 187,000 jobs in July, slightly softer than the 200,000 that economists expected. The last couple of months were revised lower, and so it’s always helpful to take a 3-month average, which is now running at 218,000. That’s stronger than the pre-pandemic average of 183,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, job growth remains strong. You will hear some people heralding this as the onset of a recession, but more likely this is just normalization of the economy rather than weakness. The report aligns with what we wrote in our Mid-Year 2023 Outlook, not to mention the title: “Edging Closer to Normal”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-payrolls-601x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector created 172,000 jobs in July, up from 128,000 in June. On a sector level, job growth this year has been driven by non-cyclical areas like health care, education, and government. These sectors had lagged in the early recovery, accounting for just 13% of jobs created in 2021, and 25% in 2022. Over the first 7 months of this year, they’ve accounted for more than 50% of jobs created. July didn’t buck that trend, with health care seeing 100,000 jobs created. Government jobs were on the softer side, rising 15,000 in July versus an average of 53,000 between April and June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cyclical areas of the economy, especially construction, manufacturing, and leisure and hospitality, remain on the softer side, with job growth adding up to 34,000 across these three sectors. So far this year, these sectors have accounted for about 20% of job creation (not exactly “weak”), versus 36% in 2022 and 43% in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the theme is normalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Labor Market Since the Late 1990s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, not far from 50+ year lows of 3.4%. What is amazing is that the unemployment rate is slightly below where it was in June 2023, when the Fed really started to get aggressive with rate hikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate can be impacted by people leaving the labor force (technically defined as those “not looking for work”) and an aging population. I’ve discussed in prior blogs how we can get around this by looking at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e. workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population. Think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you also get around the demographic issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio remained at 80.9%. That is higher than at any point since May 2001. It was actually falling at that time, and didn’t recover until now. This is the best indication that the labor market remains very healthy, and probably in the best shape since the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-employment-population-ratio-612x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line: All Signs Point to a Strong Economy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US economy runs on consumption, and for that you need income. The good news is that income growth appears to remain strong and looks to be running ahead of inflation. In fact, wage growth rose 0.4% in July. Monthly numbers can be volatile, but the 3-month annualized pace is 4.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You combine strong wage growth with strong employment, and that translates to strong income gains across the entire economy. Over the last 3 months, overall income growth for all workers is running at a 5.3% annual pace. Meanwhile, headline inflation is running close to 2.0%. The difference between the two tells you how fast incomes are growing after adjusting for inflation, and that’s running above a 3% annual pace over the past 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-real-income-growth-584x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, that’s your simplest measure of underlying economic growth and should tell you things are ok. Normalization is not the same as weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sentiment Swings Higher Despite Declines&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equities have rolled over in the past week with selling hitting a pinnacle when the US government&amp;#39;s credit rating was downgraded by Fitch on Wednesday. In spite of this, sentiment has not taken a hit. The latest survey from the AAII showed 49% of respondents reported bullish sentiment which compares to 44.9% the prior week. With nearly half of respondents reporting as optimists, bullish sentiment sits handily above its historical average of 37.5%. In fact, this week marked the ninth in a row with a bullish sentiment reading above the historical average for the longest such streak since one that ended at 13 weeks long in May 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-1.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increase in bullish sentiment resulted in bearish sentiment to drop down to 21.3% which marks a 2.8 percentage point decline on the week and resulted in the lowest bearish reading since June 10, 2021 when it was 20.7%. Similar to bullish sentiment, that is the ninth week in a row with a reading below its historical average, and that is the longest streak since July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result to the increased optimism, the bull-bear spread ticked up from 20.8 last week to 27.7. That is still below the recent high of 29.9 from two weeks ago, but reiterates how investors have an elevated degree of optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all of the gains to bulls came from bears. Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling from 31% to 29.7%. That is in the middle of the past few years&amp;#39; range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Small Dent to Claims&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial jobless claims have been trending lower over the past couple of months, reaching a nearly six month low of 221K last week. This week, claims rebounded rising 6K to 227K. Albeit off the strongest readings from last fall, that remains a healthy reading on joblessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims are at historically solid levels even if they have come off their best levels. This week, claims dropped to 205K. That is slightly above the readings from the comparable weeks of the year of the past few years (excluding 2020 and 2021 when claims were much more elevated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point of the year, claims falling is normal as shown in the second chart below. The current week of the year has only seen claims rise week over week 10.7% of the time. That is the sixth most consistent week of declines of the year. Claims will continue to face seasonal tailwinds in the weeks ahead, but that will begin to reverse as summer turns to fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing claims also ticked higher in the latest week&amp;#39;s data, reaching 1.7 million. Although higher than 1.69 million the previous week, continuing claims have much more consistently been trending lower recently, and this week&amp;#39;s reading did in fact come in below forecasts of 1.705 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Downgrades Overlooked&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom has dropped out for the major US indices today with the Nasdaq down over 2% and S&amp;amp;P 500 down 1.25% as of this writing. The catalyst has been the downgrade of the United States&amp;#39; credit rating by Fitch from AAA to AA+ . That is the first downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt in almost twelve years and just the second ever. In the charts below, we show the performance of the S&amp;amp;P 500, government debt, commodities, and the US dollar in the year before and the year after the 2011 downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 has been rallying in the months leading up to this downgrade, however, back in 2011 the S&amp;amp;P 500 had already begun rolling over by the time S&amp;amp;P downgraded US debt. In the wake of that downgrade, the S&amp;amp;P 500 went on to fully erase all of the prior year&amp;#39;s gains. Fortunately, all of those losses were quickly recouped within three months of the downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Treasuries and other US agency debt, performance over the past few months has been the complete opposite of 2011. Of course, the interest rate environment is also completely different now with Fed Funds 500 bps higher than it was at the time of the last downgrade. That being said, in 2011, Treasury yields were on the decline in the months headed into the downgrade, but contrary to what might have been expected, the downgrade itself did not change that trend. This time around has seen yields on US government debt moving in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg&amp;#39;s broad commodity index has been in a similar boat with the past few months seeing a decline compared to the steady uptrend back in 2011 that was uninterrupted by the downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would note the downgrade only acted as a longer-term turning point for the dollar. As shown in the bottom right hand chart, both this year and in 2011, the trade weighted dollar was in a downtrend in the year before the downgrade. But right as S&amp;amp;P changed its rating, the dollar turned higher and continued to rise throughout the following year. In fact, one year out it had erased the entirety of the previous year&amp;#39;s decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Stocks Don’t Like August, Now What?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.” President Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another month and more strong gains. Make that five months in a row, the S&amp;amp;P 500 finished higher. The S&amp;amp;P 500 is now up close to 20% on the year, just like everyone predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came into the year overweight stocks and remain there, so this run has been a lot of fun for us. But honestly, while we’ve been bullish, even we’ve been surprised by how strong markets have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s get the bad news out of the way. The odds are increasing that stocks could finally take some type of a break. Seasonality has worked out perfectly this year. Here’s a chart we shared many, many times, and it said that some of the very best quarters out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle were the three now just behind us. Sure enough, the fourth quarter last year and the first two quarters this year were spectacular for stocks, just like history suggested. Now seasonality is saying to be open to some type of weakness, or at least a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-1.gif.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, we do not expect major weakness. But we believe a modest pullback of approximately 5% would be perfectly normal. The S&amp;amp;P 500 has closed higher for five consecutive months. And we’re now moving into the austere month of August. August has been a poor performer, ranking worse than only February and September since 1950 and trailing behind only September and December in the last ten years, although still averaging a positive return over both periods. Oh, and right behind August comes September, the weakest month seasonally. So, while the calendar was a tailwind, we believe it is now becoming a near-term headwind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-2-copy.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking another look at August, when stocks are up more than 17.5% for the year heading into this month, a breather is even more likely. We found 11 previous years (since 1950), this occurred, and August was higher only three times and down 1.1% on average. So the better the year, the worse August does, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons we were on record for a surprise summer rally was how stocks tended to do when they had a big first month of the year. When the S&amp;amp;P 500 gained more than 5% in January a summer rally tended to occur (check). But we take seasonal warnings as seriously as seasonal support, and now we are in a period of potential seasonal weakness, at least for the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-3-copy.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If stocks experience weakness over the coming months, investors may be surprised and even start projecting the catastrophe many had expected earlier in the year. But keep in mind a pullback in the next couple of months would be entirely normal seasonal behavior. In fact, it may present buying opportunities, or it may simply be a chance to stay the course and remind ourselves that most years see more than three separate 5% pullbacks. Even in a strong year, there will often be bouts of volatility, so we should be ready for it and avoid overreacting. As President Eisenhower said, start planning today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the S&amp;amp;P 500 closed up five consecutive months yesterday. Historically, stocks have done quite well after similar streaks. In fact, the S&amp;amp;P 500 has been up a year later, 26 out of the past 28 times. However, the last time this happened was in June 2021, and that was followed by a drop of nearly 12%. Despite this recent example, the market’s historical strength is likely another indication of higher stock prices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the odds are increasing that stocks could see some seasonal weakness, but we don’t think it will be anything major. In fact, maybe a little breather could be just what the bulls need for an eventual strong end-of-year rally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;$10 Trillion Added in Market Cap; 2023&amp;#39;s Best and Worst Through July&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US stock market (using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy) has now seen an increase in market cap of roughly $10 trillion from its bear market low last October through the end of July 2023. As shown below, the peak market cap for the US stock market was $51.5 trillion seen on the first day of 2022. From high to low, total US market cap fell $13.7 trillion during last year&amp;#39;s bear, but since then it has risen back up to $47.7 trillion. To get back to new all-time highs, we currently need market cap to rise by roughly $3.8 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average Russell 3,000 stock rose 5.74% in July. There were 813 stocks in the index that rose 10%+ in July, including 29 names that rose 50%+. Below is a table of these 50%+ gainers. Four names rose 100%: PolyMet Mining (PLM), Quantum-Si (QSI), UroGen Pharma (URGN), and Bridgebio Pharma (BBIO). Other notable names on the list of big July winners include Nikola (NKLA), Upstart (UPST), Carvana (CVNA), QuantumScape (QS), Rivian (RIVN), and Riot (RIOT). This list is made up of many of the high-fliers during the post-COVID bull that then got slaughtered during last year&amp;#39;s bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through July, the average Russell 3,000 stock was up 18.1% year-to-date. Below is a list of the 35 names that are already up 200%+ on the year. Topping the list is Carvana (CVNA) with a YTD gain of 869% after gaining 77.3% in July. Back in December 2022, CVNA had fallen into the $4s, but it&amp;#39;s now back up to the mid-$40s. Next up is Bit Digital (BTBT) with a YTD gain of 638%, followed by Cipher Mining (CIFR), IonQ (IONQ), Riot (RIOT), and Applied Digital (APLD). Similar to the list of July&amp;#39;s biggest winners, the biggest winners YTD are many of the names that got hit the hardest last year, with many falling more than 70% during their bear market drawdowns. Carvana, for example, was actually down 98% from its all-time high when it bottomed in 2022, so even after gaining more than 800% this year, it needs to gain another 700% from here to get back to new highs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Key ETF Performance Through July 2023&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500-tracking ETF (SPY) finished July up 3.27%, leaving it up 20.62% YTD on a total return basis. The mega-cap Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) gained only slightly more than SPY in July, but it&amp;#39;s up more than twice as much as SPY on a YTD basis at +44.5%. The small-cap Russell 2,000 (IWM) did better than large-caps and mid-caps in July with a gain of 6.11%, but IWM is up less than large-caps on a YTD basis at +14.7%. Value and dividend stocks held up well in July and actually outperformed growth for the month, but value is lagging YTD and the DJ Dividend ETF (DVY) is actually down 0.5% on the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at US sectors, Energy (XLE) and Financials (XLF) -- which lagged in the first half of 2023 -- did the best in July, while Health Care (XLV) and Real Estate (XLRE) were up the least. Technology (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) are currently neck and neck on a YTD basis with XLK up 43.94% through July and XLC up just three basis points more at 43.97%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the US, we saw China (ASHR) and Israel (EIS) gain the most in July, while France (EWQ) and Spain (EWP) gained the least. YTD, it&amp;#39;s Mexico (EWW) that&amp;#39;s currently atop the list of country ETFs with a gain of 42.85%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil (USO) gained 15%+ in July, while natural gas (UNG) fell 4.2%. Gold (GLD) saw a small monthly gain of 2.3% versus a gain of 8.6% for silver (SLV). Finally, with yields rising again during the month, Treasury ETFs were in the red. Aside from natural gas, the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) is down more than any other asset class in our matrix on a YoY basis with a total return of -12.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dogs of the Dow for the Dog Days of Summer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Dow coming off of a historic winning streak last week, below we check in on performance of the index versus the Dogs of the Dow. The Dogs of a Dow is a stock-picking strategy that invests in the index members with the highest dividend yields at the end of a year holds them through the end of the next year. On a total return basis, the Dow&amp;#39;s recent winning streak has been a benefit to both the overall index and the Dogs alike. That said, the gains to the former have brought the index up near 2022 highs on a total return basis while the Dogs of the Dow has much further to go given the overall weakness of dividend-oriented equities recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the table below, we show the returns of this year&amp;#39;s Dogs of the Dow and all other individual Dow members. The Dogs of the Dow are host to some of the stocks with the worst performance this year like Verizon (VZ) and Chevron (CVX), however, there are also a couple of big winners like Intel (INTC) which has returned nearly 42% YTD or JPMorgan Chase (JPM) which has nearly posted a 20% return. However, the biggest gains in the index have come from non-Dogs. In fact, the largest gains this year have been from those with the lowest or no dividend yields at the end of last year like Boeing (BA), Salesforce (CRM), or Apple (AAPL).&lt;/p&gt;

# Earnings and Revenue YoY Decline

With 84% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (and 80% of the market cap roughly) having reported, the new blended earnings estimate is -5.2% YoY--one week ago, their estimate was -7.4%, so we surprised to the upside. The blended revenue estimate is +0.6% YoY. [Blended just means combine estimates of companies that haven't reported with those that have]

# Beating/Missing Earnings

&gt; Of these companies, 79% have reported actual EPS above estimates, which is above the 5-year average of 77% and above the 10-year average of 73%. [...]

&gt; In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 7.2% above estimates, which is below the 5-year average of 8.4% but above the 10-year average of 6.4%.

So 80% are beating (on average 73% do), and they are beating estimates by 7.2% on average (which is typical). Yes, analysts lowered estimates.

# Sectoral Breakdown

The year over year declines in earnings are driven entirely by 3 sectors: Energy, Materials, and Health Care. All other sectors are seeing year over year growth. Similarly, the revenue declines are only in 3 sectors: utilities, energy, materials. Notice health care missing? In fact, the top 3 sectors by revenue growth are consumer discretionary, financials, and health care. My conclusion is that healthcare's earnings decline is driven by steep margin compression. [Patents expiring? Post-Covid operations increasing costs for insurers?] While energy/materials are just seeing revenue tank and thus earnings.

Top 3 earnings sectors are Consumer discretionary, Communication Services, Industrials. Guessing thanks to AMZN, META, GOOG, CAT.

Hedge funds have lost more than $6bn this year betting against cruise lines and hotels after underestimating the resilience of US consumers. Cruise lines Royal Caribbean and Carnival are two of the 10 most heavily shorted companies in the S&amp;P 500 but have confounded short sellers’ expectations by more than doubling in value so far this year. Short sellers — typically hedge funds — aim to make money by selling borrowed stock and buying it back at a lower price when the shares decline. The sharp rally in cruise lines and other holiday accommodations, however, has left them sitting on $6.4bn of mark-to-market losses, according to data from S3 Partners. Carnival, Royal Caribbean and smaller rival Norwegian accounted for $2.9bn of the losses. Large short positions in Airbnb, which has rallied 70 per cent year to date, and Booking.com, which is up 44 per cent, have also inflicted big losses.

Many US investors started the year expecting an impending recession, encouraging them to avoid sectors that would be exposed to a downturn in consumer spending.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This ETF aims to outperform major US equity indices during market upswings by utilizing derivatives and minimize losses through investments in cash or cash equivalents during downward trends.  
&gt;  
&gt;When the Fund is allocated to U.S. equity securities, it will have approximately the following daily exposures: 80% to the S&amp;P 500®, 80% to QQQ, and up to 40% to the Sector Allocation. The Fund will utilize leverage to achieve total exposure of up to 200% of the Fund’s net assets to these allocations. A Sector Allocation of less than 40% may result in the Fund having less than 200% total exposure each day. 

  
The fund seems to have a proprietary, quantitative investment model that attempts to minimize loss and maximize gains across all market conditions.  
Given the ETF's complex structure, including 80% exposure to S&amp;P 500 Index, 80% exposure to the largest non-financial U.S. companies on NASDAQ, daily rebalancing, and up to 200% leverage, I'm curious to hear your thoughts.  


1. Has anyone heard of or invested in this new ETF?  

2. What are your thoughts on the tactical management approach described?  

3. Does anyone have experience with such actively managed, leveraged products, and could shed some light on how it works in practice?

  
Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated as I'm trying to understand this new investment vehicle better. Thanks in advance!

Job growth in July was less than expected, pointing to slower growth in the U.S. economy, the Labor Department reported Friday.

Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 187,000 for the month, slightly below the Dow Jones estimate for 200,000. Though the headline number was a miss, it actually represented a modest gain from the downwardly revised 185,000 in for June.

The unemployment rate was 3.5%, against a consensus estimate that the jobless level would hold steady at 3.6%.The rate is just above the lowest level since late 1969.

Average hourly earnings, a key figure as the Federal Reserve fights inflation, rose 0.4% for the month, good for a 4.4% annual pace. Both numbers were higher than the respective estimates for 0.3% and 4.2%.

Another important figure, the labor force participation rate held at 62.6%, the fifth straight month at that level. A more encompassing unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons fell to 6.7%, down 0.2 percentage point from June. The survey of households, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed a more robust gain of 268,000.

Health care led job creation by industry, adding 63,000 jobs for the month. Other sectors contributing included social assistance (24,000), financial activities (19,000) and wholesale trade (18,000). The other services category contributed 20,000 to the total, which included 11,000 from personal and laundry services.

Leisure and hospitality, which has been a leading sector for most of the recovery in the Covid pandemic era, added just 17,000 jobs, consistent with a slowing trend after averaging gains of 67,000 a month in the first three months of 2023.

Previous months’ totals were revised lower — the June count dropped to185,000, a downward revision of 24,000, while May was cut to 281,000, down 25,000 from the previous estimate.

Even with the slowing job gains, the economy has proved resilient against a variety of challenges, particularly a series of 11 Federal Reserve interest rate hikes aimed at bringing down inflation.

Most Wall Street experts have been forecasting a recession at least for the past year, but growth has managed to stay positive as consumers keep spending and the services sector rebounds from its pandemic-related disruptions.

Gross domestic product gains have averaged 2.2% annualized for the first half of 2023, and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker of growth is pointing to a 3.9% gain for the third quarter.

However, Fed officials including Chairman Jerome Powell have warned that the full effect of the rate increases has not been felt yet. Economists worry that the Fed could over-tighten and send the economy into recession.

Inflation data of late has been moving in the right direction. However, the Fed’s preferred gauge is still showing prices rising at a 4.1% annual rate, or more than double the central bank target.

Wages have been one component of the inflation picture. Average hourly earnings had been declining, though the annual figures are somewhat distorted by comparisons to a year ago when wages were surging.

A Labor Department gauge that the Fed follows closely showed compensation costs rising at a 4.5% 12-month rate through the second quarter. That level is not consistent with the Fed’s inflation target.

At the same time, recession fears on Wall Street appear to be ebbing.

-----------------

**Sales**

Last time I lowered my bear case for 2023 to 1.7M, with 2.15M sales expected and 2.4M in the bull case. With 889K cars sold in H1 and the announced retooling for the Model 3 refresh, I expect them to comfortably exceed my bear case, but believe the bull case needs to lowered to 2.2M for an expected amount of sales of 1.95M for the full year. With the slightly slower ramp in Texas and Berlin, the slower than expected rollout of the Cybertruck and Mexico only coming online by the end of 2024 at the earliest, I will also lower the bull cases for 2024 and 2025 from 3.4M and 4.8M respectively:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|1,800,000|2,200,000|
|**2024**|2,400,000|3,000,000|
|**2025**|3,000,000|4,400,000|

**ASP**

I expected Tesla to decrease ASPs from $54,385 to ~$51K in 2023. With ASPs of $46,379 in H1, and although I expect ASPs to be higher in H2, I will also lower my expectations here to $47K.

I then expect ASPs to increase to $49K in 2024 and then start to decline with the introduction of the compact car, starting with $48K in 2025.

**Revenue**

Based on the ASPs and delivery numbers, the new expected automotive revenues would come down to:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|$85B|$103B|
|**2024**|$118B|$144B|
|**2025**|$144B|$211B|

As for non-automotive revenue, I will leave my expectations unchanged:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|$16B|$24B|
|**2024**|$22B|$40B|
|**2025**|$30B|$60B|

**Operating Margin**

Despite IRA battery credits (starting in March), cheaper commodity prices, increasing economies of scale (especially in Berlin and Texas), operating margin came out significantly lower than I expected at ~10.5%. I will therefor lower my margin expectations for both the bear and bull cases.

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|8%|13%|
|**2024**|10%|16%|
|**2025**|12%|20%|

**Net Income**

Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|$8.1B|$16.5B|
|**2024**|$14.0B|$29.4B|
|**2025**|$20.9B|$54.2B|

**P/E**

After the incredible gains this year so far, the current $822B market cap divided by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|101|50|
|**2024**|59|28|
|**2025**|39|15|

**PEG**

This would translate into the following PEG ratings:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|N/A|1.61|
|**2024**|0.72|0.36|
|**2025**|0.79|0.18|

------------------------------

**The conclusion**

It was obvious to anyone able to do a basic financial analysis that Tesla was oversold at $108, but I heavily underestimated the effects rising interest rates would have on Tesla's ASPs and by extension margins. While Tesla looks set to easily maintain their target growth of 50% on annual unit sales, their revenues will grow at a lower pace and net income will even be largely flat this year before resuming growth.

Despite all that and the increase in stock price since my last analysis, the PE and PEG ratios show Tesla is still undervalued in the long term. Assuming growth would flatten to ~30% after 2025, Tesla would still need to grow at least 2x for the valuation to be in line with other big tech companies. That said, the opportunity has come down a very large amount since my last evaluation and although I disagree, there is now a reasonable argument to be made that Tesla is no longer a no-brainer investment that every long term investor should have in their portfolio.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past I&amp;#39;ve made multiple posts on Tesla&amp;#39;s valuation (&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10sk1gh/on_teslas_valuation_part_4/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time I lowered my bear case for 2023 to 1.7M, with 2.15M sales expected and 2.4M in the bull case. With 889K cars sold in H1 and the announced retooling for the Model 3 refresh, I expect them to comfortably exceed my bear case, but believe the bull case needs to lowered to 2.2M for an expected amount of sales of 1.95M for the full year. With the slightly slower ramp in Texas and Berlin, the slower than expected rollout of the Cybertruck and Mexico only coming online by the end of 2024 at the earliest, I will also lower the bull cases for 2024 and 2025 from 3.4M and 4.8M respectively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bear Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bull Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1,800,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2,200,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2,400,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;4,400,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expected Tesla to decrease ASPs from $54,385 to ~$51K in 2023. With ASPs of $46,379 in H1, and although I expect ASPs to be higher in H2, I will also lower my expectations here to $47K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then expect ASPs to increase to $49K in 2024 and then start to decline with the introduction of the compact car, starting with $48K in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the ASPs and delivery numbers, the new expected automotive revenues would come down to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bear Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bull Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$85B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$103B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$118B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$144B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$144B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$211B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for non-automotive revenue, I will leave my expectations unchanged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bear Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bull Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$16B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$24B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$22B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$40B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$30B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$60B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating Margin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite IRA battery credits (starting in March), cheaper commodity prices, increasing economies of scale (especially in Berlin and Texas), operating margin came out significantly lower than I expected at ~10.5%. I will therefor lower my margin expectations for both the bear and bull cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bear Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bull Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net Income&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bear Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bull Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$8.1B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$16.5B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$14.0B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$29.4B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$20.9B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$54.2B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P/E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the incredible gains this year so far, the current $822B market cap divided by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bear Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bull Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;101&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;59&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PEG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would translate into the following PEG ratings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bear Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Bull Case&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;N/A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1.61&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;0.72&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;0.36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;0.79&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;0.18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was obvious to anyone able to do a basic financial analysis that Tesla was oversold at $108, but I heavily underestimated the effects rising interest rates would have on Tesla&amp;#39;s ASPs and by extension margins. While Tesla looks set to easily maintain their target growth of 50% on annual unit sales, their revenues will grow at a lower pace and net income will even be largely flat this year before resuming growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all that and the increase in stock price since my last analysis, the PE and PEG ratios show Tesla is still undervalued in the long term. Assuming growth would flatten to ~30% after 2025, Tesla would still need to grow at least 2x for the valuation to be in line with other big tech companies. That said, the opportunity has come down a very large amount since my last evaluation and although I disagree, there is now a reasonable argument to be made that Tesla is no longer a no-brainer investment that every long term investor should have in their portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

The UAW is negotiating new four-year labor agreements for about 150,000 hourly workers at General Motors GM -1.26%decrease; red down pointing triangle, Ford Motor F 0.46%increase; green up pointing triangle and Jeep-maker Stellantis STLA -0.51%decrease; red down pointing triangle.

Currently, unionized factory workers at the Detroit car companies start at about $18 an hour. The top wage, achieved over a period of years, is about $32 an hour.

The 40% pay hike would be a general increase over the life of the next four-year contract. It would be broken up into a 20% increase upon the contract’s ratification, and four additional 5% wage increases given each year, according to a person familiar with the matter. 

A UAW spokesperson said that during the current contract, the average CEO salary at the Detroit car companies has increased 40%. “We believe UAW members deserve the same if not more.”

UAW President Shawn Fain has already taken an aggressive stance with the automakers, pledging to take a different tack than past UAW leaders and make significant gains for members, particularly on wages and benefits lost in previous rounds of talks.

In a speech to members Tuesday, he vowed to secure double-digit pay increases for members, without specifying an exact percentage.

He also outlined a list of 10 demands that he plans to bring to automakers, including the right to strike over plant closures, the re-establishment of some retiree benefits and a defined pension plan for all workers.

“Yes, we’re demanding double-digit pay raises,” Fain said during the address, which was broadcast via a Facebook livestream event.

Wages are typically a focus during bargaining between the UAW and the car companies, but this year, they have taken on greater prominence, following a period of high inflation. The union is also demanding a return of cost-of-living adjustments and other benefits given up in previous negotiations to help the car companies survive financially.

Still, a 40% pay increase is unusually large, compared with previous contracts. In the last round of talks, which concluded in late 2019, the union secured two sets of 3% increases over the life of the contract, along with lump-sum payments.

The car companies have historically resisted big pay increases, preferring to instead offer workers bonuses and other one-time payments that don’t add to their fixed costs.

Fain, a reform-minded leader elected to lead the 87-year-old union earlier this year, has taken a more militant tone in his dealings with the automakers and has made clear he is willing to strike.

He has argued that all three automakers are coming off a period of robust profits and that it is time for workers to share in the success.

GM said it plans to increase wages for workers, but that the union’s demands as they currently stand would threaten the company’s ability to support its hourly workers long-term.

Ford said it looks forward to working with the UAW, while Stellantis said it had a productive meeting Tuesday with the UAW leader and it is reviewing the union’s demands.

Along with higher wages, the UAW is also seeking greater job security for its members, particularly as the auto industry transitions away from the gasoline vehicles that have long supported factory jobs to building a new generation of electric vehicles.

Some auto executives say battery-powered vehicles require fewer workers to assemble than traditional gas-engine cars, and jobs for those who work at engine and transmission plants are at risk in a future that is more focused on EVs.

Ford, GM and Stellantis have all funneled billions of dollars into building new electric-vehicle plants and battery-making facilities in a collective bet that the technology will attract new customers.

For their part, they want more flexibility from the union to navigate this shift and reassign workers to new areas that support their long-term objectives on EVs.

Hard to talk about ideas here bc imo small caps would provide the best asymmetry if a war doesn’t happen. Companies with mining claims to big deposits could be big winners if there is a war bc it doesn’t matter what happens above ground as long as you don’t get nationalized: the metal stays in the ground unmolested (See Rick Rule and the Friedlands investing in Ivanhoe the copper mining company in the Congo in the middle of a war). But it could be  bullish oil and a geopolitical event with massive repercussions. Looking at the map, so many African countries that could be involved do produce oil. 

My guess and hope though is that there will be massive FUD coming out overnight in Africa, I buy certain stocks on Friday, and ECOWAS backs down bc even Nigeria shouldn’t want to fight wars on multiple fronts and Islamic militants at the same time.

CARR grew 5% sequentially, to $74.9 million, reflecting our focus on growing our long-term, high-margin software and services revenue

“Our technology leadership was independently recognized again this quarter with awards from AI Breakthrough and Environment + Energy Leader, a testament to our culture of innovation, as well as our advanced AI and machine learning capabilities that deliver customer value, in addition to energy and environmental benefits. Our financial results reflected this strong and expanding differentiation, with 10% sequential growth in our Software Services revenue, the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. We also continue to achieve commercial momentum, including our 313 megawatt hour (MWh) battery storage system award from Ameresco that will be placed in service in 2024. Our solar asset performance business continues to rebound, highlighted by a 304 megawatt (MW) project award in Hungary.

“Given our strong performance in the first half of the year and visibility from our backlog, we reaffirm our full-year 2023 guidance across all of our key metrics, and our continued expectation that we will achieve positive adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2023.”

I’m very pleased with the Q2 earnings, various positive aspects ranging from software revenue to increased  project sizes and guidance being reaffirmed. The company is turning out to be very strong helping customers cut costs on energy use through their AI platform Athena while also aiding grid with energy savings!

I started buying Paypal around $59 I am long leaps. I Added 6 Figures in Paypal  leaps today.I already owned a bunch of leaps before from $59 lows.

Papal is not a cigar butt, its a full fledged Cigar bar. 

\---Paypal dropped -16% in the last 2 days on nothing but strong earnings &amp; **deferred FCF which I think had retail selling which is at record high vol and algos via professionals selling.**

\---Currently it's at 2017 valuations yet they have 250 million more customers, 100 million less shares, They are bringing in +$14.5 Billion dollars more revenue per year at $27.5B and estimated to bring in upwards of $40 Billion into 2026.

\---Lower prices means they can buy back 7% of the company $5B this year and will do the same in 2024+

\---73% of the entire float is owned by Institutions.

\---New Ceo this winter.

\---Record summer &amp; winter earnings with deferred $1.2 Billion FCF added to an already $1B+ Q3 or 4 they will be using to buyback shares.

\---Their Bonds  are looking strong, $640M senior notes Japan recently….

\---668 funds that owned it Jan 2022 and sold could come back.

\---New funds investing, Ray Dalio, RtLLC,

\---High dark pool Institutional vol after hrs many days sometimes over 19% of daily average vol.

\---Large share buybacks $4.1B 12Mt Lower prices =More shares, they cut some fat in BNPL to add more than $1 billion in buybacks.

\---So I do use paypal a lot for my business and have since early 2000s. Spending thousands in fee's a year or more , that are well spent...

\---Works the best for safe overseas transactions that nobody imo can compete with especially in some of the billion people nations.

\---Users will continue to grow overseas especially currently about 43%.--- One reason earnings have been choppy was usd vs the other currencies as usd was dominating the last 9 months or so. They sold some BNPL from Europe and FCF will shift to Q3 or Q4.

\---$5.1 Billion FCF Trailing 12m

\---Non-Transaction Operating Expenses declined 12% which is very nice to see. Cost saving helped Meta run just mentioning it could help.

\---I am not worried about competition in the space, there is plenty of room for growth and paypal still has it's moat regardless of what you hear. Apple pay , Google pay etc have been around for years... Do a google trends search of all three worldwide.

\---Paypal owns  Braintree which is actually a partner with Apple Pay,  Charge hound , Happy Returns,  Honey,  Hyperwallet , Paidy, Simility,  Venmo,  Xoom, and  Zettle.

\---As a recession hits paypal will be the go to place for people in the gig economy and starting up businesses.

\---paypal owns many companies like Venmo etc which are growing rapidly and will do well in hard times as they have in the past.

\---I believe they can really boost ROE a lot more with those billions especially buying back 7% of the company at low prices. They can buy back 7% of the company today for $5b if you go back to 2021 valuations this is a gain of $20 billion dollars for a worth of $25 billion dollars for the $5 billion in shares or 80.5M they can buy back . Major shareholder value in a couple years.

\--- FED Now is NOT replacing paypal- It's actually bullish long term and expands the market here is why- Paypal to me is not a U.S. play, its international and as the internet via starlink opens doors to billions of more people there will be 100s of millions of new customers for paypal. Competition is good.  Also if you ever worked in the government you know that it's not going to work right for years...

\---This market has hammered many of the biggest stock like META and AMAZON the last year that saw -25% draw down overnight too which is now up 260% since I last covered it here on Reddit like this.

Stocks can move fast in this market.

TLDR: Bullish Paypal and believe it could pull a meta type move over the next 12-18 months because of it's valuation currently, its international growth potential and new management. I have Leaps.

&lt;p&gt;I started buying Paypal around $59 I am long leaps. I Added 6 Figures in Paypal  leaps today.I already owned a bunch of leaps before from $59 lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Papal is not a cigar butt, its a full fledged Cigar bar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---Paypal dropped -16% in the last 2 days on nothing but strong earnings &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;deferred FCF which I think had retail selling which is at record high vol and algos via professionals selling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---Currently it&amp;#39;s at 2017 valuations yet they have 250 million more customers, 100 million less shares, They are bringing in +$14.5 Billion dollars more revenue per year at $27.5B and estimated to bring in upwards of $40 Billion into 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---Lower prices means they can buy back 7% of the company $5B this year and will do the same in 2024+&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---73% of the entire float is owned by Institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---New Ceo this winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---Record summer &amp;amp; winter earnings with deferred $1.2 Billion FCF added to an already $1B+ Q3 or 4 they will be using to buyback shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---Their Bonds  are looking strong, $640M senior notes Japan recently….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---668 funds that owned it Jan 2022 and sold could come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---New funds investing, Ray Dalio, RtLLC,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---High dark pool Institutional vol after hrs many days sometimes over 19% of daily average vol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---Large share buybacks $4.1B 12Mt Lower prices =More shares, they cut some fat in BNPL to add more than $1 billion in buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---So I do use paypal a lot for my business and have since early 2000s. Spending thousands in fee&amp;#39;s a year or more , that are well spent...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---Works the best for safe overseas transactions that nobody imo can compete with especially in some of the billion people nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---Users will continue to grow overseas especially currently about 43%.--- One reason earnings have been choppy was usd vs the other currencies as usd was dominating the last 9 months or so. They sold some BNPL from Europe and FCF will shift to Q3 or Q4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---$5.1 Billion FCF Trailing 12m&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---Non-Transaction Operating Expenses declined 12% which is very nice to see. Cost saving helped Meta run just mentioning it could help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---I am not worried about competition in the space, there is plenty of room for growth and paypal still has it&amp;#39;s moat regardless of what you hear. Apple pay , Google pay etc have been around for years... Do a google trends search of all three worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

The company's stock rose **14.04%** in the market today, following the announcement of their Q2 2023 results and the appointment of a new CFO. Read below for a financial highlight.

**Background**

Confluent, founded in 2014 by the original creators of Apache Kafka, has become an integral part of the modern data stack.

 Their platform, used across various industries including banking, retail, logistics, manufacturing, and telecommunications, enables businesses to harness the power of stream processing to make data a continually flowing resource.

Companies such as **Credit Suisse, Domino's, and Expedia Group** are among the numerous businesses successfully leveraging Confluent's platform.

Confluent differentiates itself with a cloud-native solution that reimagines Kafka for the cloud. It provides a complete package for developers to build next-generation applications securely.

Moreover, Confluent is designed to be present wherever its customers need it.

Their go-to-market strategy is product-led, which allows customers to get hands-on with the product early on, delivering faster time-to-value.

The model is also consumption-oriented, with customer health and actual usage being primary indicators of success.

**Financial Highlights:**

- Confluent reported a **total revenue** of **$189.3 million**, a **36% YoY increase**.
- The company's **Confluent Cloud revenue** was **$84 million**, a **78% YoY increase**.
- **Non-GAAP Operating Margin** improved to **-9.2%** from **-33.5%** in Q2 2022.

**Customer Metrics:**

- The number of **customers with $100,000 or greater in ARR** increased **33% YoY** to **1,144**.
- Confluent has successfully driven customer expansion in various sectors, as illustrated by the significant ARR growth achieved by customers in the **online travel, health benefits, payment card, and banking sectors.**

In addition to their financial results, Confluent announced the appointment of Rohan Sivaram as their new CFO, effective August 16. Sivaram, who brings a wealth of experience to the role, previously held the position of Senior Vice President of Finance at Palo Alto Networks before joining Confluent in October 2020. He will replace Steffan Tomlinson, who is leaving the company for another opportunity.

Targeting a total addressable market of approximately $60 billion, Confluent expects to achieve a non-GAAP operating margin target of 0% by Q4 2023. The company's strong financial performance and strategic appointments set the stage for an exciting future in the data streaming market.

137,stocks,"The company’s DTC division reported $410 million in licensing revenue, more than triple last year’s sales, after offering shows like “Westworld” to rivals

Revenue from licensing HBO content buoyed Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming business in the second quarter, the company revealed in its earnings report Thursday. The sales helped significantly narrow its loss and appeared to be playing a big part in the company’s promise for its U.S. direct-t0-consumer business to turn a profit in 2023.

The media giant reported $2.73 billion in revenue in its DTC segment, which launched its Max service during the quarter. That was a 37% leap from last year’s second quarter, and represented about 26% of the company’s total revenue for the period. The segment swung to a $3 million EBITDA loss for the second quarter after reporting $50 million in positive EBITDA in the first quarter.

Content licensing revenue at $410 million revenue rose notably, more than tripling the $132 million reported in the same quarter last year, suggesting that the company would have had a far more significant loss without those fees.

The growth in licensing reflects a surprising move in recent months toward offering HBO shows like “Westworld” to free, ad-supported streaming TV services like Amazon’s Freevee and the Roku Channel. Warner Bros. Discovery also licensed HBO shows including “Insecure” to Netflix.

CEO David Zaslav said on a call with analysts Thursday that it would seek to do deals on a “co-exclusive” basis, meaning the licensed shows would also be available to Max subscribers.

Distribution revenue of $2.19 billion made up the bulk of the division’s total, including traditional HBO subscriptions, Max and HBO Max subscriptions, and Amazon Prime Video Channels revenue. Advertising revenue jumped 26% to $121 million, also mainly driven by subscriber growth. Total DTC subscribers fell by 1.8 million in the quarter to 95.8 million.

Zaslav told analysts the company’s deep content library “offers a wealth of opportunity in terms of feeding our own platforms, as well as others.”

“It’s a mainstay of our business to create great content and window width, through creating value in each window,” he said. “And as you would expect a lot of analysis and strategic discussion goes into these decisions. In some cases, we’ll want to keep premium content exclusively on our platform for a very long time. In other cases, we may sell it to third parties, and we don’t lose anything by growing the pie.”

“The fact is licensing some library content to others VOD platforms like Netflix or Amazon as part of a co-exclusive agreement is just smart business,” Zaslav said. “We’re expanding our audience, while maximizing the value of the asset and providing more revenue streams. And that is our job, to optimize the windowing to get the best possible return on investment.”

Warner Bros Discovery also inked deals with Roku and Tubi to license 2,000 hours of content and launch a series of channels in January. It also plans to introduce its own FAST service this year.

Later in the call, the CEO noted that if the Hollywood strikes continue, “there may be more demand” for WBD content.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s DTC division reported $410 million in licensing revenue, more than triple last year’s sales, after offering shows like “Westworld” to rivals&lt;/p&gt;

Get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in business, from Wall Street to Silicon Valley — delivered daily.

The founder of a key Apple supplier warned of disaster on Wall Street should a war break out over Taiwan.

""If a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, it wouldn't take a month or even an hour, but just 10 seconds for the Wall Street stock market to collapse,"" Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou wrote on Facebook on Wednesday, according to an Insider translation. His post appears to have been deleted by Thursday morning, although a cached copy of the post remains.

Gou, the 72-year-old founder of the contract manufacturing giant Foxconn, wrote the post after meeting New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman on the same day.

He said he told Friedman that Taiwan's role in the global economy is far more important than that of Ukraine, which is now embroiled in a war with Russia. China claims self-ruled Taiwan — the world's top chip supplier — as its territory and has been ramping up military drills around the island.

Gou added Taiwan may be able to hold out in a war for three months, but the impact on the world's economy and financial markets would be huge and immediate.

Gou founded Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, in 1974. He is worth nearly $7.2 billion, with a substantial portion of his wealth derived from a 12.6% stake in the publicly traded division of Foxconn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The tycoon's comments about geopolitical tensions over the Taiwan Strait come amid speculation over his political ambitions.

The business magnate stepped down as Foxconn's chairman in 2019 in a bid to run for Taiwan's presidency, but dropped out of the race after he failed to win the nomination of KMT, Taiwan's main opposition party. He tried again this year, but again failed to win the party's nomination.

Some analysts think Gou may still make a run for the island's top job, the South China Morning Post reported on July 18.

Gou did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider sent to his verified Instagram account.

The Taiwan presidential election is scheduled to take place on January 13, 2024.

&gt; Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.

&gt; Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Thursday, August 3rd, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Thursday, August the 3rd, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall after U.S. downgrade spurs a sell-off, traders scrutinize latest earnings: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock futures slipped Wednesday as traders contended with Fitch’s recent downgrade of the United States’ long-term rating. Traders also assessed the latest batch of quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures tied to the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also dropped 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 95 points, or 0.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of chipmaker Qualcomm slipped 8% after the company missed analysts’ expectations on fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance for the current period. DoorDash added 3.6% after beating expectations on revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech bellwether Apple and e-commerce giant Amazon are slated to report after the close. Thus far, nearly 67% of the constituents in the S&amp;amp;P 500 have issued their latest quarterly reports, with about 81% of those companies beating expectations, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks on Wednesday sold off, led by a more than 2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. It marked the worst day since February for the index, as tech stocks tumbled amid a spike in bond yields. Both the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings cut the United States’ long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA late Tuesday, citing “expected fiscal deterioration” over the next three years as well as weakening governance. Previously, stocks were posting a strong string of gains, led by growth names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes markets need to digest a [torrent] of gains and this, coupled with a choppy seasonal backdrop, was poised for a pullback,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “Fitch provided the rationale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the way of economic data, traders will be gearing up for weekly initial jobless claims, as well as durable goods orders. The main event will be Friday’s July payrolls report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

# [Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”
*****
&gt; A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.
*****
&gt; “I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.
*****
&gt; CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Wednesday, August 2nd, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Wednesday, August the 2nd, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall after Fitch downgrades U.S. rating, earnings season continues: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday after Fitch downgraded the long-term rating for the U.S. and traders continued to assess the latest batch of second-quarter earnings results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings lowered the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA Tuesday night, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A busy earnings week carried on. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2% before the bell on better-than-expected results. CVS Health gained 2% on strong earnings as it trims costs. Meanwhile, SolarEdge Technologies tumbled 12% after missing second-quarter revenue expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those moves came after a lackluster first day of trading to start August. On Tuesday, the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.43%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 71.15 points, or 0.2%, and reached its highest level since February 2022 at one point in the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings season is more than halfway through with results coming in stronger than expected. Of the S&amp;amp;P 500 companies that have reported, about 82% have posted positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The earnings beats have added to bullish investor sentiment, continuing this year’s recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think in the last five or six weeks, the lack of the ’23 bear case isn’t the only explanation. I think now it’s a more more plausible 2024, 2025 bull case,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s an emerging number of possibilities that seems to make people think, ‘Alright, maybe 2024 earnings ... could represent the beginning of a new multi year trend.’ And so that, I think, is gaining steam among investors,” Parker added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVS Health, Yum! Brands and Humana are set to report earnings before the open Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders are also anticipating the July ADP jobs report Wednesday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a 175,000 increase, which would be lower than the 497,000 rise in the prior month.&lt;/p&gt;

166,stocks,"Apple is expected to witness a decline in iPhone sales during the April-June quarter, attributed to cautious consumer behaviour in a slow economy as the launch of a new model is anticipated. As the tech giant prepares to release its earnings report, analysts emphasise the significance of revealing its utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost growth.

Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv.
Specifically, iPhone sales are anticipated to have declined by over 2% during this period, based on a survey of 24 analysts conducted by Visible Alpha. This contrasts with a nearly 3% increase in sales during the same quarter last year and a 1.5% rise in the preceding quarter (January-March).

The upcoming quarterly report may serve as a deviation from the positive earnings trend observed in other prominent tech companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Microsoft. These companies have demonstrated resilience in their cloud-based operations and have witnessed a surge in digital ad sales.
""Apple is not immune to general macroeconomic trends and will continue to set the pace (for the smartphone industry) for quite some time,"" Reuters quoted Bob O'Donnell, founder of TECHnalysis Research, as saying.
In September, analysts anticipate the unveiling of the much-anticipated iPhone 15, which could feature the widely accepted USB-C port on certain models. This development may provide a slight boost to iPhone sales during the July-September quarter, according to market experts, who have differing opinions on the overall performance during this period.

Notably, Apple has a tradition of not providing quarterly outlooks. However, industry analysts speculate that the tech giant might shed light on its utilisation of AI to enhance the upcoming product lineup, offering insights into the company's innovative approach.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is expected to witness a decline in iPhone sales during the April-June quarter, attributed to cautious consumer behaviour in a slow economy as the launch of a new model is anticipated.

&lt;p&gt;Apple, the world&amp;#39;s most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv.
Specifically, iPhone sales are anticipated to have declined by over 2% during this period, based on a survey of 24 analysts conducted by Visible Alpha. This contrasts with a nearly 3% increase in sales during the same quarter last year and a 1.5% rise in the preceding quarter (January-March).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upcoming quarterly report may serve as a deviation from the positive earnings trend observed in other prominent tech companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Alphabet (Google&amp;#39;s parent company) and Microsoft. These companies have demonstrated resilience in their cloud-based operations and have witnessed a surge in digital ad sales.
&amp;quot;Apple is not immune to general macroeconomic trends and will continue to set the pace (for the smartphone industry) for quite some time,&amp;quot; Reuters quoted Bob O&amp;#39;Donnell, founder of TECHnalysis Research, as saying.
In September, analysts anticipate the unveiling of the much-anticipated iPhone 15, which could feature the widely accepted USB-C port on certain models. This development may provide a slight boost to iPhone sales during the July-September quarter, according to market experts, who have differing opinions on the overall performance during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, Apple has a tradition of not providing quarterly outlooks. However, industry analysts speculate that the tech giant might shed light on its utilisation of AI to enhance the upcoming product lineup, offering insights into the company&amp;#39;s innovative approach.&lt;/p&gt;

Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA on Tuesday, pointing to “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,” as well as a growing general debt burden.

Back in May, the agency placed the nation’s AAA rating on negative watch, blaming the debt ceiling fight. At the time, lawmakers in Washington butted heads over an agreement that would keep the federal government from running out of money. President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill on June 2, just days away from the “X-date” on June 5.

The country’s recent debt limit feud was mentioned again in the downgrade.

“In Fitch’s view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025,” the ratings agency said.

“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” Fitch said.

The agency also highlighted the rising general government deficit, which it anticipates will rise to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. “Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending (15% of total federal spending) as agreed in the Fiscal Responsibility Act offer only a modest improvement to the medium-term fiscal outlook,” Fitch said.

The agency also noted that a combination of tightening credit conditions, weakening business investment and a slowdown in consumption could lead the economy into a “mild” recession in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of next year.

This isn’t the first time a rating agency has downgraded the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA in 2011 after Washington managed to avoid a default.

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street’s busiest earnings week continues: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.
*****
&gt; Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.
*****
&gt; More than 160 S&amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.
*****
&gt; To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.
*****

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, August 1st, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading month of August and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Tuesday, August the 1st, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures fall as Wall Street’s busiest earnings week continues: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as investors await a flood of corporate earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped by 101 points, or 0.3%. Futures linked to the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer will be posting their results Tuesday morning. Investors will also be keeping an eye on Caterpillar and Uber’s quarterly earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 160 S&amp;amp;P 500 constituents are slated to report their latest quarterly results this week. More than half of the companies in the broad market index have already reported, with 80% posting earnings beats, according to FactSet. This further raises hopes that the economy will be able to avoid a recession as inflation begins to show signs of slowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan noted that expectations coming into this season were negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We beat that bar, but still, thus far [there have] been indications that we’re going to end up in a negative year-over-year growth from an earnings standpoint,” said Buchanan. “But we’re more concerned and frankly, somewhat optimistic about the earnings picture for the second half of this year, in particular 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that signs of a widening market rally have emerged in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As this market continues to kind of turn higher, we’re expecting a broader participation with small cap participating, [with] some spaces of the value cohort participating as well,” Buchanan added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic indicators, including job openings and labor turnover numbers from June and the July manufacturing purchasing managers’ index will also be released Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major indexes all ended Monday’s main trading session modestly higher. The Dow rose 0.28%, while the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.15% and 0.21%, respectively. In July, the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Dow each gained more than 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 4.1%.&lt;/p&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical analysis (TA)&lt;/strong&gt; uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;priced in&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security&amp;#39;s price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.&lt;/p&gt;

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.
[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%.

Exxon Mobil Corp. is in talks with Tesla Inc., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and other automakers about supplying them with lithium as the oil giant works to build a business around the crucial battery metal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Exxon is one of several oil and gas companies seeking to expand into lithium production to take advantage of surging demand for use in electric-vehicle batteries, and as a way of diversifying beyond fossil fuels. The talks with potential customers are still early stage, and the company has yet to lay out its plans for potential lithium operations. However, the discussions are the latest sign of Exxon’s growing interest in the lithium business.

The company has also had conversations with battery giants Samsung and SK On Co., the people said, asking not to be named because the information is private. Exxon, SK On and Volkswagen declined to comment. Tesla, Ford and Samsung didn’t reply to messages seeking comment.

The rapid global roll out of electric vehicles has raised the risk of bottlenecks and shortages for key battery materials like lithium, sparking a rush to invest in and secure supply.

I understand raising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, encourages savings and makes lending harder, hence discouraging inflation. Cool

207,stocks,"Ad-supported streaming tiers from Netflix, Disney and others have collectively surpassed 100 million users in the United States and could generate over $10 billion in revenue domestically by 2027, new research from the London-based firm Ampere Analysis found.

More than 1 million Netflix accounts and around 800,000 Disney+ subscribers in the U.S. are on ad-supported tiers, according to Ampere, representing nearly 2% of each service’s total subscriber base. The firm estimates that more than 90% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad-supported tier, representing around 45 million subscriptions.

Prior to the launch of Max, Discovery+ had somewhere in the region of 10 million ad-supported accounts, while HBO Max had around 2 million, Ampere said. It added that Peacock has more than 30 million ad-supported subscribers, the most of any new U.S. OTT service, while Paramount+ has more than 25 million ad-supported subscribers in the U.S.

Ampere believes that hybrid services are “an increasingly important element of streaming service monetization, and hybrid tiers often generate more revenue per subscription than their ad-free counterparts.” It also says that the tiers “represent a way for consumers to maintain a wider array of subscriptions while economic times remain tough.”

Ampere’s latest research comes as earnings season for the major studios is in full swing.

Netflix, which recently eliminated its basic ad-free plan in the United States as it expands its password sharing crackdown, added 5.9 million paid subscribers during the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 238.4 million globally. During its upfront presentation to advertisers in May, Netflix reported that the ad tier had nearly 5 million monthly active users.

Meanwhile, NBCUniversal parent Comcast reported that Peacock had a total of 24 million paid subscribers. The streaming service, which dropped its free tier for new users in January, recently said it would bump up the price for its Premium and Premium Plus tiers to $5.99 and $11.99, respectively, which will take effect on Aug. 17. Due to certain streaming rights and contracts with content providers, some Peacock content still has ads.

Next up on the earnings docket will be Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its Max rebrand on May 23 — which offers a $9.99 per month Max Ad Lite tier, $15.99 per month Max Ad Free tier and $19.99 per month Max Ultimate Ad Free tier.

208,stocks,"*BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year*

Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 31.07.23, 08:15 AM

Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).

The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.

The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.

At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.

BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.

When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.

In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan. Top officials at Chowringhee’s Virginia House held a conference call with a bunch of analysts to defend the plan, explain how it would benefit both the parent and the demerged entity, and soothe the investors who have been flustered by the move.

Meanwhile, BAT drew our attention to a little-publicised interview that Tadeu Marroco — who took over as BAT CEO on May 15 — had with Deutsche Bank’s Gerry Gallagher at the Global Consumer Conference on June 7 where he admitted that he had been under pressure to sell its strategic stake in ITC for close to a year and had resisted it stoutly.

“It’s a good thing we didn’t sell it a year ago when a lot of people were pressuring me,” said Marroco, who was BAT’s finance and transformation director before he stepped into the corner office at London’s Globe House which serves as the headquarters of the maker of Dunhill, Kent, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Rothmans cigarettes.

**Galloping run**

The ITC share price has galloped this year, rising 40.8 per cent year to date when it closed at Rs 468.55 on Friday.Pointing to the surge in the ITC stock and BAT’s high leverage, Gallagher bluntly prodded Marroco: “There’s a decent amount of value there (in ITC)…It will help your leverage, just do the trade.

”The BAT CEO enumerated a number of reasons why it made sense for the tobacco giant to stay put.Marroco drew a red line for BAT: it would have to hold at least 25 per cent if it wanted to stay invested in ITC. The CEO said: “Then we can keep (our) board seats, we can veto resolutions of the company, and we can try to steer the company to (harness) opportunities” that BAT believes exist in India.

A few years ago, BAT blocked an ITC board resolution to reward its executives with stock options, fearing that this would lower its stake in the Indian conglomerate.In its annual report last year, BAT claimed that it had suffered a deemed loss of £3 million in 2022 arising from the “deemed disposal of part of the Group’s shareholding in ITC (due to issuance of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).

”But that isn’t the only problem that is holding BAT back from a stake sale. The bigger problem for BAT is to find a buyer.India’s FDI regulations bar foreign investors from entering the tobacco sector. This considerably narrows the field to find a buyer for the stake and extract a decent price.

In his interview with Gallagher, Marroco succinctly summed up the issue: “So, we will have to find a local player who has all this money…And that is not to mention the complications in terms of the RBI’s process certificates and all that. So, it’s not easy. It’s not easy.

”Moreover, it makes a great deal more sense for the ITC stock to surge as the market cottons on to the valuation upside that the cognoscenti believe that it possesses. Marocco is also betting that valuations will start brimming over soon.

The BAT CEO expounded on the logic behind this argument. “The ITC valuation has risen by about 24-25 times (in terms of earnings per share)…It’s still a big gap compared with all the FMCGs in India which have valuations of about 40 times. So, there is a lot of potential value (that ITC can realise).”

**Strategic role**

The BAT CEO also outlined a strategic imperative for staying invested in ITC.

Having overtaken China to become the most populous country in the world, India isconsidered as the largest oral product market for tobacco companies.According to Marroco, India is bigger than all oral markets put together and, therefore, presents a huge opportunity.Oral nicotine pouches, such as BAT’s Velo, which originated in Scandinavia, are one such modern oral product. They are small bags that are placed in the mouth between the upper lip and gum, which contain nicotine but no tobacco.

BAT claims that they are a modern and unobtrusive way for smokers and vapers to use nicotine. They also come in a variety of nicotine strengths and flavours to suit different tastes and preferences.

For the moment, such oral products cannot be launched in India due to the local regulation which forbids oral products above 2 milligrams of nicotine in pouches.

Marroco is hoping that India will eventually relax its rules just as the markets for vaping opened up in Peru, Columbia and Chile recently.“This product, nicotine pouch, can have a massive positive impact on Indian society….So, we want to work with ITC on what could be a massive opportunity, (provide) a positive impact for India and also for the business. That’s the strategic relevance,” Marroco argued.

**Tightrope**

Market watchers believe that BAT is still walking a tightrope over here: it makes sense to stay invested in India but it can’t scorn the opportunity to cash out either. After all, one credit rating agency gave a negative outlook to its BBB+rating year soon after it announced the share buy back last year because — as Marroco claimed — they calculate the leverage differently from BAT. And that is one of the reasons why BAT halted the share buyback plan.

The latest half-yearly report of BAT says: “We are making good progress reducing our leverage towards the middle of our 2-3x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA range by the end of 2023, driven by continued strong cash generation.

”The BAT Group also has to deal with debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years.Once these issues are resolved, the company hopes to return to its commitment of making a 65 per cent dividend payout over the long term.

Meanwhile, speculation continues to swirl in the market which is eagerly waiting for the next twist in the ITCBAT saga.

&lt;p&gt;Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 31.07.23, 08:15 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will British American Tobacco (BAT) sell a part of its 29.1 per cent stake in ITC Ltd, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate?The rumour mills have started to churn with the tantalising question hanging in the air after the ITC stock soared last Monday to an all-time high of Rs 499.60, ratcheting up the value of BAT’s stake in the Calcutta-based giant to almost £ 16.8 billion (or Rs 1,77,525 crore).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is BAT is caught in a dilemma: it needs a mountain of cash to pay off its massive debt which prompted it to slam the brakes on a £2 billion share buyback plan announced in February last year.BAT had a net debt of £39.2 billion as on December 31, 2022 (£36.3 billion in 2021) which was 2.9 times to the adjusted EBIDTA. Last Tuesday, BAT announced its half-yearly results for the period ended June 30 which showed that net debt had gone down further to £38.34 billion – but still remains a daunting figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tobacco giant has been focusing efforts on deleveraging its balance sheet, leaving its shareholders somewhat concerned about their returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, BAT cannot walk away easily from a steady stream of cash that flows into its coffers from ITC in the form of dividends and turn its back on the myriad business opportunities that it hopes to exploit through ITC in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAT earned £427 million in dividend from ITC in 2022 compared with £383 million in 2021.In its half-year results, BAT said its share of ITC’s post-tax results had risen 21.8 per cent to £319 million from £262 million during the same period a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When The Telegraph sent in a questionnaire to BAT to seek its views on the rising global market chatter that it might be seriously considering the possibility of selling at least a part of its stake in ITC, it got no straight answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one sense, the dynamics of the situation changed somewhat after ITC decided last week to demerge its hotels business in which the Calcutta-based parent will hold a 40 per cent. The announcement sent the ITC stock skidding on the stock markets as investors vented their disappointment with the plan.

The company released its second-quarter financial results on Thursday. The U.S.-based automaker's EV division, called ""Ford Model e,"" has lost $1.8 billion so far this year, according to Fortune.

The projected $4.5 billion loss is over twice as much as Model e's $2.1 billion loss in 2022. The company recently announced that the price of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks will be reduced due to cheaper raw battery materials.

The company touted that its low EV prices ""establish[es] leadership ahead of industry’s next-generation EVs"" and that the Ford Model e's revenue is up 39%. Ford is also expected to produce 600,000 EVs per year by 2024.

Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by $2.7 billion, up 26% during the second quarter to $12.7 billion at quarterend, and over 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are from direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the second quarter, the median FICO score was 747. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end. As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans. Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. SoFi Bank, N.A. generated $63.1 million of GAAP net income at a 17% margin.”

SoFi continues to thrive in this macro environment:

* Galileo, Technisys, and bank charter form the pillars for SoFi to become ""The AWS of Fintech""
* The acquisition of Wyndham Capital on April 3rd completes the three arms of lending under one umbrella. This cut off the middleman fee and maximizes profitability for the most lucrative segment of SoFi's businesses.
* The wide diversity of SoFi business allows it to thrive in any macro environment.
* SoFi's Savings with direct deposit APY of 4.4% gives an extra push for deposit growth in subsequent quarters.

Am I understanding how selling covered calls work, in that the following are the possible outcomes?

1. **Share price rises to strike price ($12)** \- You make $200.00 from the stock increasing, plus $50 for the sale of the contract. You are obligated to sell 100 shares for $12.00 each to the buyer. Your net profit is $250.00.
2. **Price goes way up, (example, share price increase to $50.00)** \- You make $200.00 from the stock increasing, but you don't profit any further than your strike price. Also, $5 for the sale of the contract. You are obligated to sell your 100 shares for $12.00 each to the buyer. Your net profit is $250.00.
3. **Price goes down (example, share price decrease to $8.00)** \- You lose $200 from the stock decreasing. You gain $50.00 from the sale of the contract. Net loss - $150

GRAB was 1 of the earliest entrants into the Southeast Asia market for ride sharing, in Singapore it was at loggerheads with Uber and eventually beat out Uber, taking over Uber in Singapore and dominating the market. GRAB is trying to paint the same dream as Alibaba of being a super app for day to day use.  


# REVENUE:

I used a semi-bottoms up approach when creating the revenue model of GRAB, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and what %of GMV translates into Revenue. GMV is the total merchandise value that GRAB is selling, but because some of that merchandise value is given to e.g. Riders so GRAB's actual revenue is lesser than GMV. As a simplifying assumption, since GRAB is at core a ride sharing company, I look at historically what % of taxi fare a traditional taxi company takes as commission. This number is about 33%, but I'd assume a lesser amount in my forecast given that GRAB is a new app that needs to build up their network effect. ([SOURCE](https://work.chron.com/much-fare-taxi-drivers-keep-22871.html))  
  
Y/Y, Revenue/GMV will grow at a slow pace in the starting years of my forecast as the taxi industry slowly sets off into the sun and ridesharing begins to gain more prominence. So in the later years of my forecast, Revenue/GMV starts growing rapidly.

# COST:

A cost breakdown of GRAB as of FY22 is 94.6% Incentive given to drivers, 19.5% Marketing, 45.1% G&amp;A, 32.5% R&amp;D. The percentage adds to more than 100% because GRAB is losing money.   
  
  
Taking ComfortDelGro (Traditional Taxi) and Kakao (Superapp) as reference for how much the margins should be for GRAB.  
Kakao’s EBIT margins for FY21 and 22 is 9.7% and 8.2% respectively.

Assuming that GRAB’s margins is in between Kakao and ComfortDelGro, slightly leaning more towards ComfortDelGro’s as ComfortDelGro is reflective of GRAB's main business of being a ride hailing app.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

Taxes, GRAB's taxes tend towards Singapore marginal corporate tax rate at 17%. GRAB is based on the Cayman islands, but it does not seem possible for them to avoid taxes and since most of their business operations are done in Southeast Asia, I’d assume they will eventually move to Singapore and pay Singapore taxes.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, at base case I price GRAB at about $2.04. The superapp dream sold by GRAB which management keeps feeding to shareholders is inflating their valuation artificially. Management keeps pushing out this metric of ""Adjusted EBITDA"" but this adjustment takes out a lot of things, a lot of seemingly recurring ""One-Time off transaction"" and in turn rewards managements for beating their ""Adjusted EBITDA"". They are not running towards the goal post, the goal post is being moved nearer to them. But, given that GRAB is still the largest player in Southeast Asia which is yet to be fully penetrated especially in countries without mobile access, the potential is quite high but I don't like the tale the management constantly spins about ""Adjusted EBITDA"", it seems as if they are trying to convince themselves instead of investors.

Does this mean I have no other option on the site or other platforms for investing on my own? Can i just use his account for the time being until I turn 18 or is that super illegal and fraudulent?

245,stocks,"Let's summarize the reasons why INTC is at the current price:

* \- Lagging behind in technology
* \- Poor track record of management
* \- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history
* \- Losing market share in most segments
* \- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues
* \- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush
* \- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days

&amp;#x200B;

Still, let's underline some facts:

**Market valuation landscape:**

* \- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold.
* \- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.

**Strategy:**

Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:

* \- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)
* \- Catching up to TSMC's tech

They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.

Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**

The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.

If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.

We already have positive things to say about their execution:

* \- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.
* \- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.
* \- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.
* \- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irrational fears:**

* \- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:

Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.

* \- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:

Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologise to anyone wanting a quick read but this is a long post because I think it's necessary to share my thought process that lead to my conclusion for this company. Please don't use this post as a reason to invest in Ferrari but rather see how I break down and analyse companies and maybe you can pick up a tip or two along the way! This post will also break down how I calculate the intrinsic value of Ferrari. This analysis is broken down into four sections:

1. History/Overview of the business
2. Business Segments 
3. Financial Highlights 
4. My Thoughts and Company Valuation 

***History/Overview of the Business:***

Ferrari is named after their founder Enzo Ferrari. An Alfa Romeo driver since 1924, Enzo Ferrari founded his own racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, in Modena in 1929 initially to race Alfa Romeo cars. In 1939 he set up his own company, initially called Auto Avio Costruzioni. In late 1943, Enzo Ferrari moved his headquarters from Modena to Maranello, which remains Ferrari's headquarters to this day.

Ferrari is among the world’s leading luxury brands, focused on the design, engineering, production and sale of the world’s most recognisable luxury performance sports cars. Their brand symbolizes exclusivity, innovation, state-of-the-art sporting performance and Italian design and engineering heritage. The name and history and the image enjoyed by Ferrari cars are closely associated with their Formula 1 racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, the most successful racing team in the history of Formula 1. From the inaugural year of Formula 1 in 1950 through the present, Scuderia Ferrari has won 242 Grand Prix races, 16 Constructors’ World Titles and 15 Drivers’ World titles. Ferrari are the only team which has taken part in all the editions of the Championship, racing in more than 1,000 Formula 1 Grand Prix races. 

Ferrari's product offering comprises four main pillars: Range, Special Series, Icona and Supercar. Ferrari targets end clients seeking high performance cars with distinctive design and state-of-the-art technology. Their target end clients can be divided into two main categories: on the one hand, the “Sports Car Driver”, a client looking for an elegant and understated design, who likes driving their car in a variety of locations and conditions, alone or with passengers, and who use their Ferrari for longer journeys, on the other hand, the “Pilot”, a client looking for a high performing and extreme sports car, who intend to drive their car on track and on challenging roads, and who are looking for an exciting driving experience.

Ferrari has a strategy of maintaining *low volumes compared to demand,* as well as to the higher number of models in our product portfolio and our more frequent launches compared to our competitors. We are not focused on market share as a performance metric. Instead, we deliberately manage our supply relative to demand, to defend and promote our brand exclusivity and premium pricing. Competition among similarly positioned luxury performance cars is also driven by price and total cost of ownership. Resilience of the car value after a period of ownership is an important competitive dimension among similarly positioned luxury cars, because higher resilience decreases the total cost of ownership and promotes repeat purchases: *this is a strong competitive advantage of Ferrari cars.* 

***Business Segments:***

*Design:*

The company has a Ferrari Design Centre, which is an in-house design department, with the objective of improving control over the entire design process and ensuring long-term continuity of the Ferrari style. ***A guiding principle of the Ferrari style is that each new model represents a clear departure from prior models*** and introduces new and distinctive aesthetic elements, delivering constant innovation within the furrow of tradition. Their designers, modelers and engineers work together to create car bodies that incorporate the most innovative aerodynamic solutions within the elegant and powerful lines typical of Ferrari cars. 

*Ferrari Classiche:*

The Ferrari Classiche department support Ferrari customers in managing the ***historic Ferrari vehicles (over 20 years from their production) with the objective of keeping as many of these classic cars on the road as possible.*** Services include the certification of the authenticity of classic Ferrari cars and vehicles of particular historical relevance, the management of Ferrari restoration and repair activities, as well as the management of Ferrari spare parts, including when these are no longer available on the market. The authenticity of the car with respect to the initial specifications is checked via a technical inspection and benefits from a comprehensive archive containing drawings of each of the individual chassis and details of historical components. Based on the evidence gathered during the inspection, the car is then presented to an expert committee, chaired by the founder’s son Pierro Ferrari, for the certification. 

We view the surviving Ferrari vehicles of historical value as the tangible legacy and incarnation of our brand. The Ferrari classiche department also supports and encourages the direct participation of clients in strategic historical events.   


*Sales Segments:*

Ferrari sells their cars exclusively through a network of authorised dealers. Ferrari also supplies parts for current and older models of Ferrari to our authorised dealer network. In addition, substitution of spare parts during the life of the car, sales are driven by clients’ demand for parts to customise their parts and maximise performance, particularly after a change in ownership, we well as parts required to compete in the Ferrari challenge and other client races. They also supply parts to Ferrari models currently out of production, with stocks dating back to 1995. The stock of parts for even older models is currently owned and managed by a third party which in some cases also manufactures out-of-stock parts based on our designs. The sale of parts is a profitable component of our product mix and is expected to benefit from the increase in the number of *Ferrari cars in circulation.* 

Ferrari has also been selling engines for Maserati since 2003. They also earn revenue from sponsorships from F1 racing, selling apparel merchandise, and leasing out their Mugello racetrack. 

*Driving Events, Circuit and Museum:* 

Ferrari hosts a wide range of driving events for owners and prospective owners. Ferrari also has their own Mugello racetrack along with two museums. The Museo Enzo Ferrari (MEF) is built around the house in which Enzo Ferrari was born in 1898. The MEF tells the story of Enzo Ferrari as a young boy discovering the irresistible allure of the world of motor racing, his career as a driver in the 1920s, as the driving force behind the Scuderia Ferrari in the 1930s, and then as Ferrari, the Constructor, from 1947 onwards. The Ferrari Museum Maranello invites visitors to experience the Prancing Horse dream first hand, offering them a journey through the Group’s history, values and automotive world.

***My thoughts:*** 

There are a lot of things I like about this company. I am going to go over some qualitative reasons and then go over quantitative reasons on why I like this company and then proceed to company valuation. 

*Qualitative reasons:* 

* Ferrari models each have a unique design meaning that each model is completely seperate from their prior models. This means that if you purchase a Ferrari, the car will *not depreciate in value* and older Ferrari models will hold heritage value. This is unique among car manufacturers. This is evident as we can see that more than 50% of Ferrari cars have been sold to existing owners. Most Ferrari owners end up becoming repeat purchasers and stay very loyal to the brand. 
* I had some fears about regulations in the auto industry pushing car manufacturers away from ICE engines. However, this doesn't seem to impact Ferrari as Hybrid models represented 22% of total shipment volume in 2022, up from 2% in 2020. Customers are still happy to purchase a Ferrari since 2022 had their highest shipment volumes in history. 
* Ferrari's management incentives are aligned with shareholders and is focused on the long-term. 	FERRARI has a loyalty voting program which is intended to reward shareholders for maintaining long-term share ownership by granting initial shareholders and persons holding their common shares continuously for at least three years the option to elect to receive special voting shares. Special voting shares cannot be traded and, if common shares participating in the loyalty program are sold they must be deregistered from the loyalty register and any corresponding special voting shares transferred to us for no consideration. Exor and Pierro Ferrari participate in the company’s loyalty voting program and, therefore, effectively hold two votes for each of the common shares they hold. Pierro Ferrari holds a 10% interest in the company. 
* As more Ferrari's cars come in circulation, the Ferrari's spare parts segment will continue to grow revenue as the years go on. This is because more clients will demand to have their cars optimised. 
* Worldwide car sales was around 67.2 million in 2022. Ferrari unit shipment was 13,221. **This brand is very** ***exclusive and holds scarcity value.*** 
* Ferrari engages in R&amp;D for their Formula 1 racing activities. While Ferrari develops these technologies for use in their Formula 1 cars, they seek to transfer these technologies and components to models in their current and future product portfolio. 

*Quantitative Reasons:* 

* Ferrari's revenue has increased every year since it went public
* Return on Net Tangible Assets have consistently been above 40% which is fantastic and this is with Net Tangible Assets growing every year!
* Return on Total Assets have remained at double digits in every year.
* Margins have increased since 2015

***Company Valuation:***

Ferrari's ambition is to launch 15 new models between 2023-2026 and I don't have much doubt they can achieve this since Ferrari has consistently delivered on their past ambitions. I have calculated the intrinsic value of Ferrari by applying the discounted cash flow calculator. Free Cash Flow is calculated by taking *cash flow from operations and subtract it by maintenance capital expenditures*. 

* I will not use a 17% growth rate since the past 5-year 17% growth was from 2017 (*Free cash Flow was second lowest at $468,359)* and it is also too optimistic. 
* Using a growth rate of 9-12% with a 10% discount rate, ***my buy price ranges from $150 to $195.*** I will purchase the company if price is slightly above this range because I am confident in the company's competitive position and management. 

I hope you enjoyed the analysis!

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Everyone, I have recently analysed Ferrari and wanted to share my analysis on the company. I apologise to anyone wanting a quick read but this is a long post because I think it&amp;#39;s necessary to share my thought process that lead to my conclusion for this company. Please don&amp;#39;t use this post as a reason to invest in Ferrari but rather see how I break down and analyse companies and maybe you can pick up a tip or two along the way! This post will also break down how I calculate the intrinsic value of Ferrari. This analysis is broken down into four sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History/Overview of the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business Segments &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial Highlights &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Thoughts and Company Valuation &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;History/Overview of the Business:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferrari is named after their founder Enzo Ferrari. An Alfa Romeo driver since 1924, Enzo Ferrari founded his own racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, in Modena in 1929 initially to race Alfa Romeo cars. In 1939 he set up his own company, initially called Auto Avio Costruzioni. In late 1943, Enzo Ferrari moved his headquarters from Modena to Maranello, which remains Ferrari&amp;#39;s headquarters to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferrari is among the world’s leading luxury brands, focused on the design, engineering, production and sale of the world’s most recognisable luxury performance sports cars. Their brand symbolizes exclusivity, innovation, state-of-the-art sporting performance and Italian design and engineering heritage. The name and history and the image enjoyed by Ferrari cars are closely associated with their Formula 1 racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, the most successful racing team in the history of Formula 1. From the inaugural year of Formula 1 in 1950 through the present, Scuderia Ferrari has won 242 Grand Prix races, 16 Constructors’ World Titles and 15 Drivers’ World titles. Ferrari are the only team which has taken part in all the editions of the Championship, racing in more than 1,000 Formula 1 Grand Prix races. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferrari&amp;#39;s product offering comprises four main pillars: Range, Special Series, Icona and Supercar. Ferrari targets end clients seeking high performance cars with distinctive design and state-of-the-art technology. Their target end clients can be divided into two main categories: on the one hand, the “Sports Car Driver”, a client looking for an elegant and understated design, who likes driving their car in a variety of locations and conditions, alone or with passengers, and who use their Ferrari for longer journeys, on the other hand, the “Pilot”, a client looking for a high performing and extreme sports car, who intend to drive their car on track and on challenging roads, and who are looking for an exciting driving experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferrari has a strategy of maintaining &lt;em&gt;low volumes compared to demand,&lt;/em&gt; as well as to the higher number of models in our product portfolio and our more frequent launches compared to our competitors. We are not focused on market share as a performance metric. Instead, we deliberately manage our supply relative to demand, to defend and promote our brand exclusivity and premium pricing. Competition among similarly positioned luxury performance cars is also driven by price and total cost of ownership. Resilience of the car value after a period of ownership is an important competitive dimension among similarly positioned luxury cars, because higher resilience decreases the total cost of ownership and promotes repeat purchases: &lt;em&gt;this is a strong competitive advantage of Ferrari cars.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Segments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has a Ferrari Design Centre, which is an in-house design department, with the objective of improving control over the entire design process and ensuring long-term continuity of the Ferrari style. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A guiding principle of the Ferrari style is that each new model represents a clear departure from prior models&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and introduces new and distinctive aesthetic elements, delivering constant innovation within the furrow of tradition. Their designers, modelers and engineers work together to create car bodies that incorporate the most innovative aerodynamic solutions within the elegant and powerful lines typical of Ferrari cars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ferrari Classiche:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ferrari Classiche department support Ferrari customers in managing the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;historic Ferrari vehicles (over 20 years from their production) with the objective of keeping as many of these classic cars on the road as possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Services include the certification of the authenticity of classic Ferrari cars and vehicles of particular historical relevance, the management of Ferrari restoration and repair activities, as well as the management of Ferrari spare parts, including when these are no longer available on the market. The authenticity of the car with respect to the initial specifications is checked via a technical inspection and benefits from a comprehensive archive containing drawings of each of the individual chassis and details of historical components. Based on the evidence gathered during the inspection, the car is then presented to an expert committee, chaired by the founder’s son Pierro Ferrari, for the certification. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We view the surviving Ferrari vehicles of historical value as the tangible legacy and incarnation of our brand. The Ferrari classiche department also supports and encourages the direct participation of clients in strategic historical events.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sales Segments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferrari sells their cars exclusively through a network of authorised dealers. Ferrari also supplies parts for current and older models of Ferrari to our authorised dealer network. In addition, substitution of spare parts during the life of the car, sales are driven by clients’ demand for parts to customise their parts and maximise performance, particularly after a change in ownership, we well as parts required to compete in the Ferrari challenge and other client races. They also supply parts to Ferrari models currently out of production, with stocks dating back to 1995. The stock of parts for even older models is currently owned and managed by a third party which in some cases also manufactures out-of-stock parts based on our designs. The sale of parts is a profitable component of our product mix and is expected to benefit from the increase in the number of &lt;em&gt;Ferrari cars in circulation.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferrari has also been selling engines for Maserati since 2003. They also earn revenue from sponsorships from F1 racing, selling apparel merchandise, and leasing out their Mugello racetrack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Driving Events, Circuit and Museum:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferrari hosts a wide range of driving events for owners and prospective owners. Ferrari also has their own Mugello racetrack along with two museums. The Museo Enzo Ferrari (MEF) is built around the house in which Enzo Ferrari was born in 1898. The MEF tells the story of Enzo Ferrari as a young boy discovering the irresistible allure of the world of motor racing, his career as a driver in the 1920s, as the driving force behind the Scuderia Ferrari in the 1930s, and then as Ferrari, the Constructor, from 1947 onwards. The Ferrari Museum Maranello invites visitors to experience the Prancing Horse dream first hand, offering them a journey through the Group’s history, values and automotive world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things I like about this company. I am going to go over some qualitative reasons and then go over quantitative reasons on why I like this company and then proceed to company valuation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qualitative reasons:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferrari models each have a unique design meaning that each model is completely seperate from their prior models. This means that if you purchase a Ferrari, the car will &lt;em&gt;not depreciate in value&lt;/em&gt; and older Ferrari models will hold heritage value. This is unique among car manufacturers. This is evident as we can see that more than 50% of Ferrari cars have been sold to existing owners. Most Ferrari owners end up becoming repeat purchasers and stay very loyal to the brand. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had some fears about regulations in the auto industry pushing car manufacturers away from ICE engines. However, this doesn&amp;#39;t seem to impact Ferrari as Hybrid models represented 22% of total shipment volume in 2022, up from 2% in 2020. Customers are still happy to purchase a Ferrari since 2022 had their highest shipment volumes in history. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferrari&amp;#39;s management incentives are aligned with shareholders and is focused on the long-term.    FERRARI has a loyalty voting program which is intended to reward shareholders for maintaining long-term share ownership by granting initial shareholders and persons holding their common shares continuously for at least three years the option to elect to receive special voting shares. Special voting shares cannot be traded and, if common shares participating in the loyalty program are sold they must be deregistered from the loyalty register and any corresponding special voting shares transferred to us for no consideration. Exor and Pierro Ferrari participate in the company’s loyalty voting program and, therefore, effectively hold two votes for each of the common shares they hold. Pierro Ferrari holds a 10% interest in the company. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As more Ferrari&amp;#39;s cars come in circulation, the Ferrari&amp;#39;s spare parts segment will continue to grow revenue as the years go on. This is because more clients will demand to have their cars optimised. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide car sales was around 67.2 million in 2022. Ferrari unit shipment was 13,221. &lt;strong&gt;This brand is very&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;exclusive and holds scarcity value.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferrari engages in R&amp;amp;D for their Formula 1 racing activities. While Ferrari develops these technologies for use in their Formula 1 cars, they seek to transfer these technologies and components to models in their current and future product portfolio. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quantitative Reasons:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferrari&amp;#39;s revenue has increased every year since it went public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return on Net Tangible Assets have consistently been above 40% which is fantastic and this is with Net Tangible Assets growing every year!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return on Total Assets have remained at double digits in every year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margins have increased since 2015&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Company Valuation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferrari&amp;#39;s ambition is to launch 15 new models between 2023-2026 and I don&amp;#39;t have much doubt they can achieve this since Ferrari has consistently delivered on their past ambitions. I have calculated the intrinsic value of Ferrari by applying the discounted cash flow calculator. Free Cash Flow is calculated by taking &lt;em&gt;cash flow from operations and subtract it by maintenance capital expenditures&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will not use a 17% growth rate since the past 5-year 17% growth was from 2017 (&lt;em&gt;Free cash Flow was second lowest at $468,359)&lt;/em&gt; and it is also too optimistic. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a growth rate of 9-12% with a 10% discount rate, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;my buy price ranges from $150 to $195.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I will purchase the company if price is slightly above this range because I am confident in the company&amp;#39;s competitive position and management. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed the analysis!&lt;/p&gt;

*****
&gt; Stocks rose Friday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 closing out their third winning weeks in a row as a measure of inflation closely watched by the Federal Reserve came in at its lowest in nearly two years.
*****
&gt; The Dow jumped 176.57 points, or 0.50%, to 35,459.29. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.99% to 4,582.23. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.90% to 14,316.66.
*****
&gt; All three major averages notched weekly gains with the 30-stock average up by about 0.66%. On Thursday, the Dow ended a 13-day win streak, a length not seen since 1987. The S&amp;P advanced 1.01%, and the tech-heavy index is up 2.02%.
*****
&gt; This week, investors cheered data showing cooling inflation and stronger-than-expected earnings reports that supported the case the U.S. could avoid a recession.

&gt; On Friday, June data for the personal consumption expenditures price index continued to show easing inflation. The gauge showed core PCE gained 0.2% month-over-month, in line with the 0.2% increase expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. Core PCE rose 4.1% from the year-ago period, lower than the anticipated 4.2%.

&gt; The data is of particular interest after the central bank raised interest rates earlier this week in a widely expected move. The Fed targets inflation at 2% annually.

*****
&gt; Earnings season continued with Dow member Procter &amp; Gamble shares gaining nearly 3%. The consumer goods company behind Tide and other brands beat analysts’ earnings and revenue expectations in its most recent quarter.
*****
&gt; Intel jumped 6.6% as investors applauded a return to profitability, while Roku climbed 31% a day after beating Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines.
*****
&gt; On the other hand, Ford Motor shares fell 3.4% even though the automaker beat estimates and raised guidance. The company said its electric vehicle adoption was taking longer than expected due to higher costs.

&gt; # Sentiment Staying Bullish

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has continued its rally but sentiment has not exactly reflected that. The latest reading on investor sentiment from the AAII survey showed bullish sentiment dropped back below 50% this week. 44.5% of respondents reported as bullish in the past week which is right in line with the average reading of the past two months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The 6.5-point decline in bulls was only partially picked up by bearish sentiment which rose from 21.5% (the lowest level in over two years) to 24.1%. Albeit higher sequentially, that remains a muted reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment took home a larger share of the drop to bulls with the reading rising to 31% from 27.1%. That is only the most elevated reading in two weeks as neutral sentiment is the closest of any response to its respective historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-AAII-4.png))** 

&gt; While the AAII survey showed some moderation in optimism this week, that was not the case for other surveys. In last Thursday's Closer, we discussed how alongside the AAII survey, multiple other sentiment readings have tipped in favor of bulls recently. One such indicator that has continued to become more bullish is the NAAIM Exposure index which tracks the average equity exposure of active investment managers. Readings range from -200 to +200. -200/+200 would imply on average money managers are leveraged short/long, readings of -100/+100 would be fully short/long, and a reading of zero would be market neutral. This week the index tipped above 100 for the first time since late November 2021. In other words, active money managers are now fully long for the first time in over a year and a half. That streak of readings below 100 also ends as the fourth longest in the survey's history at 86 weeks in a row.

&gt; # Jobless Claims Back to Improving

&gt; It was a solid morning for economic data with a number of indicators coming in better than expected. Weekly jobless claims were one of those with seasonally adjusted initial claims unexpectedly falling to 221K from 228K last week and the lowest level since the second half of February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; Before seasonal adjustment, claims fell significantly week over week as could be expected for this point of the year. The 44.5K drop this week was in line with the average historical drop for the current week of the year as claims have fallen 80% of the time. Going forward, there will continue to be seasonal tailwinds through the end of summer before the typical fourth quarter turn higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; As for continuing claims, the seasonally adjusted reading likewise hit a new short-term low coming in at just 1.69 million. That is the lowest reading and first sub-1.7 million since the end of January. Combined with the initial claims reading, this recent data points to a return to strength in the labor market data following deterioration late last year through the early spring.

&gt; # Where the Jobs Were

&gt; In last night's Closer, we discussed the latest job postings data from job listings website Indeed. Compared to the official reading on labor market demand -- the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) -- which is released monthly at a two-month lag, this Indeed data is a daily look with much lower latency. The latest release as of Tuesday covers postings through July 21st. As shown below, postings remain in a downtrend in spite of a modest rebound in the latest month. Having tracked well with the official data, modeling JOLTS on the Indeed data would predict JOLTS to continue to fall to around 9.57 million for the June data scheduled to be released next week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-Indeed-1.png))**

&gt; The Indeed data also provides a good deal of demographic granularity based upon geographic areas. As shown below, the first two years of the pandemic had been a boon for smaller metro areas as they generally saw healthier readings on postings than the largest cities. While that dynamic moderated through the back half of 2021 through early 2022, the past year has seen the trend return. As shown in the charts below, postings have fallen regardless of MSA size, but larger metros have experienced a much more substantial drop. The smallest metros, on the other hand, have seen a much more modest decline, especially over the past several months. Check out the big drop in the second chart below showing the spread between the largest and smallest metros:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072723-Indeed-2.png))**

&gt; The data also provides a breakdown based on job industry. In the table below, we show the change in each industries' postings since the pre-pandemic baseline of early February 2020. Currently, there are six groups with a lower reading on postings versus pre-pandemic: IT Operations &amp; Helpdesk, Media &amp; Communications, Marketing, Information Documentation and Design, Software Development, and Mathematics. Meanwhile, several health care and engineering related roles continue to sit atop the list with the greatest post-pandemic growth in job postings. Finally, we would also note that some industries like Human Resources and logistics-related industries that saw postings boom on account of strong hiring and stressed supply chains have moderated. Today, those same indices now have postings that are middle of the pack at best.

&gt; # Emerging Markets (EEM) Attempts a Break Out

&gt; Today we published our most recent Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high level summary of 22 major economies. Taking a look at those same countries' stock markets via US traded ETFs, 2023 has seen broad rebounds in equity prices across the globe. At the moment, the average country ETF is 4.55% away from a 52-week high after posting a double-digit YTD gain. Based on developed and emerging countries, there has been some divergence. Both last year and again this year, emerging market equities have seen modest outperformance relative to developed markets. That has also been the case in July with an average gain of 5.24% for EM countries versus a 2.85% rise for their developed market peers. South Africa (EZA) is up the most month-to-date with a 10.2% gain, while France (EWQ) is up the least with a gain of just 13 bps so far in July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072623-GMD.png))**

&gt; From a technical perspective, the gains in emerging markets—proxied by the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM)—have resulted in a move above resistance at some of the past year's highs. As shown below, earlier in the spring and again only a couple of weeks ago, EEM attempted to retest the levels from last summer unsuccessfully. Today, EEM is back above those levels with the next resistance to watch being the January high at $42.50.

&gt; # 1st 8 or 9 Days of August Weaker Pre-Election Years

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/345224256ecb8d1ce20e12a6d06270ee/4bcc06987525e2f0-66/s500x750/e03274d8a5663643a4905fb0347b567aae67aca4.png))**

&gt; First eight or nine trading days of August have exhibited weakness while mid-month has been better. This pattern holds in pre-election years with greater magnitude (dashed lines). Note the bullish cluster from August 15 through 17. This strength is visible above on trading days 11, 12 and 13. The end of August tends to be softer when traders evacuate Wall Street for a summer finale. The last five days were generally bearish from 1996 to 2013 but have been positive in seven of the last nine years. In 2022, S&amp;P 500 dropped 4.5% in the last five trading days of August. S&amp;P 500 has also only been up nine times on the penultimate day of August in the past 27 years.

&gt; # Most Confident Consumers in Two Years

&gt; In case you didn't see it already, today's report on Consumer Confidence from the Conference Board showed that consumers are more confident than they have been at any point in the last two years. While there are still no shortage of negative macro headlines, with employment remaining strong, inflation easing, and the stock market in a bull market, you can't fault consumers for being more confident than they have been in recent history.

&gt; For some perspective on the current levels of consumer sentiment, the chart below shows historical readings of Consumer Confidence with red dots showing each time that the monthly reading made a new two-year high. As you can see, these types of readings aren't rare, especially during prolonged economic expansions, and as a corollary to the saying that it's often darkest before the dawn, sentiment tends to be brightest right up until sunset.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072523-Consumer-Confidence.png))**

&gt; In each of the prior periods where sentiment hit a two-year high just before the economy started to roll over, it was preceded by multiple occurrences of sentiment hitting new two-year highs. If we further filter out occurrences for periods when sentiment hit a two-year high for the first time in at least a year, the picture looks a lot different. In this case, there was never an occurrence just as the economy was on the verge of a recession, and most of them tended to occur early in the cycle rather than late. Interestingly enough, with all the debate over whether or not the economy is in a recession or not, the pattern of Consumer Confidence in the current period looks very much similar to the pattern during the double-dip recession of the early 1980s. Like the current period, back then there was a sharp drop and subsequent sharp rebound in confidence followed by another decline that failed to make a lower low. The only difference this time around is that following the initial COVID recession of 2020 there wasn't another recession in the next two years- at least not an officially declared recession.

&gt; # August Can Be Challenging in Pre-Election Years

&gt; Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best &gt; DJIA month from 1901 to 1951. Now it is the worst DJIA and second worst S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 month over the last 35 years, 1988-2022 with average performance ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to a –0.9% loss by DJIA. Last year, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, and Russell 1000 all declined over 4% in August.

&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1988; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998, with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2022 of over 4% by DJIA have widened its August average decline.

&gt; In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve modestly: #8 DJIA, #9 S&amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #11 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000. However, all five indexes have declined in August during the last three pre-election years, 2019, 2015 and 2011. It would appear, August’s pre-election year advantage is fading.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and an awesome trading week ahead r/stocks. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Friday evening to all of you here on &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt;! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 31st, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 closes nearly 1% higher on softening inflation data, nabs 3rd week of gains: Live updates - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks rose Friday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;amp;P 500 closing out their third winning weeks in a row as a measure of inflation closely watched by the Federal Reserve came in at its lowest in nearly two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dow jumped 176.57 points, or 0.50%, to 35,459.29. The S&amp;amp;P 500 added 0.99% to 4,582.23. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.90% to 14,316.66.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three major averages notched weekly gains with the 30-stock average up by about 0.66%. On Thursday, the Dow ended a 13-day win streak, a length not seen since 1987. The S&amp;amp;P advanced 1.01%, and the tech-heavy index is up 2.02%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, investors cheered data showing cooling inflation and stronger-than-expected earnings reports that supported the case the U.S. could avoid a recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, June data for the personal consumption expenditures price index continued to show easing inflation. The gauge showed core PCE gained 0.2% month-over-month, in line with the 0.2% increase expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. Core PCE rose 4.1% from the year-ago period, lower than the anticipated 4.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data is of particular interest after the central bank raised interest rates earlier this week in a widely expected move. The Fed targets inflation at 2% annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the wake of stronger than expected GDP, and a better-than-expected earnings season, this could be the catalyst to send the market to new highs,” wrote Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings season continued with Dow member Procter &amp;amp; Gamble shares gaining nearly 3%. The consumer goods company behind Tide and other brands beat analysts’ earnings and revenue expectations in its most recent quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel jumped 6.6% as investors applauded a return to profitability, while Roku climbed 31% a day after beating Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Ford Motor shares fell 3.4% even though the automaker beat estimates and raised guidance. The company said its electric vehicle adoption was taking longer than expected due to higher costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sentiment Staying Bullish&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 has continued its rally but sentiment has not exactly reflected that. The latest reading on investor sentiment from the AAII survey showed bullish sentiment dropped back below 50% this week. 44.5% of respondents reported as bullish in the past week which is right in line with the average reading of the past two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 6.5-point decline in bulls was only partially picked up by bearish sentiment which rose from 21.5% (the lowest level in over two years) to 24.1%. Albeit higher sequentially, that remains a muted reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neutral sentiment took home a larger share of the drop to bulls with the reading rising to 31% from 27.1%. That is only the most elevated reading in two weeks as neutral sentiment is the closest of any response to its respective historical average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the AAII survey showed some moderation in optimism this week, that was not the case for other surveys. In last Thursday&amp;#39;s Closer, we discussed how alongside the AAII survey, multiple other sentiment readings have tipped in favor of bulls recently. One such indicator that has continued to become more bullish is the NAAIM Exposure index which tracks the average equity exposure of active investment managers. Readings range from -200 to +200. -200/+200 would imply on average money managers are leveraged short/long, readings of -100/+100 would be fully short/long, and a reading of zero would be market neutral. This week the index tipped above 100 for the first time since late November 2021. In other words, active money managers are now fully long for the first time in over a year and a half. That streak of readings below 100 also ends as the fourth longest in the survey&amp;#39;s history at 86 weeks in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobless Claims Back to Improving&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a solid morning for economic data with a number of indicators coming in better than expected. Weekly jobless claims were one of those with seasonally adjusted initial claims unexpectedly falling to 221K from 228K last week and the lowest level since the second half of February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before seasonal adjustment, claims fell significantly week over week as could be expected for this point of the year. The 44.5K drop this week was in line with the average historical drop for the current week of the year as claims have fallen 80% of the time. Going forward, there will continue to be seasonal tailwinds through the end of summer before the typical fourth quarter turn higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for continuing claims, the seasonally adjusted reading likewise hit a new short-term low coming in at just 1.69 million. That is the lowest reading and first sub-1.7 million since the end of January. Combined with the initial claims reading, this recent data points to a return to strength in the labor market data following deterioration late last year through the early spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Where the Jobs Were&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In last night&amp;#39;s Closer, we discussed the latest job postings data from job listings website Indeed. Compared to the official reading on labor market demand -- the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) -- which is released monthly at a two-month lag, this Indeed data is a daily look with much lower latency. The latest release as of Tuesday covers postings through July 21st. As shown below, postings remain in a downtrend in spite of a modest rebound in the latest month. Having tracked well with the official data, modeling JOLTS on the Indeed data would predict JOLTS to continue to fall to around 9.57 million for the June data scheduled to be released next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indeed data also provides a good deal of demographic granularity based upon geographic areas. As shown below, the first two years of the pandemic had been a boon for smaller metro areas as they generally saw healthier readings on postings than the largest cities. While that dynamic moderated through the back half of 2021 through early 2022, the past year has seen the trend return. As shown in the charts below, postings have fallen regardless of MSA size, but larger metros have experienced a much more substantial drop. The smallest metros, on the other hand, have seen a much more modest decline, especially over the past several months. Check out the big drop in the second chart below showing the spread between the largest and smallest metros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data also provides a breakdown based on job industry. In the table below, we show the change in each industries&amp;#39; postings since the pre-pandemic baseline of early February 2020. Currently, there are six groups with a lower reading on postings versus pre-pandemic: IT Operations &amp;amp; Helpdesk, Media &amp;amp; Communications, Marketing, Information Documentation and Design, Software Development, and Mathematics. Meanwhile, several health care and engineering related roles continue to sit atop the list with the greatest post-pandemic growth in job postings. Finally, we would also note that some industries like Human Resources and logistics-related industries that saw postings boom on account of strong hiring and stressed supply chains have moderated. Today, those same indices now have postings that are middle of the pack at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Emerging Markets (EEM) Attempts a Break Out&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we published our most recent Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high level summary of 22 major economies. Taking a look at those same countries&amp;#39; stock markets via US traded ETFs, 2023 has seen broad rebounds in equity prices across the globe. At the moment, the average country ETF is 4.55% away from a 52-week high after posting a double-digit YTD gain. Based on developed and emerging countries, there has been some divergence. Both last year and again this year, emerging market equities have seen modest outperformance relative to developed markets. That has also been the case in July with an average gain of 5.24% for EM countries versus a 2.85% rise for their developed market peers. South Africa (EZA) is up the most month-to-date with a 10.2% gain, while France (EWQ) is up the least with a gain of just 13 bps so far in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, the gains in emerging markets—proxied by the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM)—have resulted in a move above resistance at some of the past year&amp;#39;s highs. As shown below, earlier in the spring and again only a couple of weeks ago, EEM attempted to retest the levels from last summer unsuccessfully. Today, EEM is back above those levels with the next resistance to watch being the January high at $42.50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1st 8 or 9 Days of August Weaker Pre-Election Years&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/345224256ecb8d1ce20e12a6d06270ee/4bcc06987525e2f0-66/s500x750/e03274d8a5663643a4905fb0347b567aae67aca4.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First eight or nine trading days of August have exhibited weakness while mid-month has been better. This pattern holds in pre-election years with greater magnitude (dashed lines). Note the bullish cluster from August 15 through 17. This strength is visible above on trading days 11, 12 and 13. The end of August tends to be softer when traders evacuate Wall Street for a summer finale. The last five days were generally bearish from 1996 to 2013 but have been positive in seven of the last nine years. In 2022, S&amp;amp;P 500 dropped 4.5% in the last five trading days of August. S&amp;amp;P 500 has also only been up nine times on the penultimate day of August in the past 27 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Most Confident Consumers in Two Years&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you didn&amp;#39;t see it already, today&amp;#39;s report on Consumer Confidence from the Conference Board showed that consumers are more confident than they have been at any point in the last two years. While there are still no shortage of negative macro headlines, with employment remaining strong, inflation easing, and the stock market in a bull market, you can&amp;#39;t fault consumers for being more confident than they have been in recent history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some perspective on the current levels of consumer sentiment, the chart below shows historical readings of Consumer Confidence with red dots showing each time that the monthly reading made a new two-year high. As you can see, these types of readings aren&amp;#39;t rare, especially during prolonged economic expansions, and as a corollary to the saying that it&amp;#39;s often darkest before the dawn, sentiment tends to be brightest right up until sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072523-Consumer-Confidence.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each of the prior periods where sentiment hit a two-year high just before the economy started to roll over, it was preceded by multiple occurrences of sentiment hitting new two-year highs. If we further filter out occurrences for periods when sentiment hit a two-year high for the first time in at least a year, the picture looks a lot different. In this case, there was never an occurrence just as the economy was on the verge of a recession, and most of them tended to occur early in the cycle rather than late. Interestingly enough, with all the debate over whether or not the economy is in a recession or not, the pattern of Consumer Confidence in the current period looks very much similar to the pattern during the double-dip recession of the early 1980s. Like the current period, back then there was a sharp drop and subsequent sharp rebound in confidence followed by another decline that failed to make a lower low. The only difference this time around is that following the initial COVID recession of 2020 there wasn&amp;#39;t another recession in the next two years- at least not an officially declared recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;August Can Be Challenging in Pre-Election Years&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best &amp;gt; DJIA month from 1901 to 1951. Now it is the worst DJIA and second worst S&amp;amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 month over the last 35 years, 1988-2022 with average performance ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to a –0.9% loss by DJIA. Last year, DJIA, S&amp;amp;P 500, NASDAQ, and Russell 1000 all declined over 4% in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributing to this poor performance since 1988; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998, with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2022 of over 4% by DJIA have widened its August average decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve modestly: #8 DJIA, #9 S&amp;amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #11 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000. However, all five indexes have declined in August during the last three pre-election years, 2019, 2015 and 2011. It would appear, August’s pre-election year advantage is fading.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the good:

Revenues grew 12.0% YOY on a CC basis (this post will be CC) to 1.072B with Crocs growing 14.9% to 833m with a **38.9%** operating margin.

Consolidated adjusted Operating margin was 30.3%

$299.1 million of debt was paid down reducing total debt to $2B.

Due to gross leverage now being 1.8x, Crocs is now able to resume share repurchases. As a result, Crocs bought 400,000 shares for $50 million at an average cost of $117

In addition, full year guidance is now being raised to $4B-$4.06B with an adjusted operating margin of 27.5%, representing 12.5%-14.5% revenue growth and an operating margin expansion of 50 to 150 bp.

This compares favorably to a prior guidance of 11%-14% revenue growth and adjusted operating margin of 26%.

Here's the bad:

Q3 guidance was very disappointing, only showing 3-5% revenue growth YoY in consolidated revenue. Adjusted operating margin remains high at 27.0%.

Furthermore, HEYDUDE is showing lackluster growth for 2023. Sales grew **just 3%** YoY to 239m in 2Q2023. As a result, Crocs issued a guidance cut for HEYDUDE: 14-18% revenue growth vs previous mid-20% growth. This was explained in the earnings call: HEYDUDE does not have a long track history, resulting in wholesalers not agreeing to sell them. However, the CEO believes this is just a short term impasse and will be insignificant for the long term growth of HEYDUDE. 

In addition, HEYDUDE has been unable to show margin expansion with gross margins growing 0 bp and operating margins decreasing 500 bp YoY.

Takeaway:

Crocs is telling shareholders HEYDUDE is dragging down Crocs as a whole. While their core revenue segment crocs is a cash cow, with an operating margin of **38.4%**, HEYDUDE is very meager at just **27.6%** for 2Q2023. That being said, Crocs is picking up the slack with increased revenue growth and improved profitablity, allowing Crocs to lift their full year guidance and profitability metrics.

At just a 10 P/E and a 6.5B market cap, you are paying just 1.5X 2023 sales. I continue to believe Crocs is massively undervalued by at least 100%, and believe Crocs will turn HEYDUDE around and become a 20B company within the next 5 years with CEO Andrew Rees leading the way.

Goldman and a group of investors has agreed an all cash offer for Kahoot! I’m a shareholder but the price offer is below my purchase price and hence I am reluctant to sell. 

It is not clear to me from the offer if I can be required to sell and whether the investor group has already secured enough ownership to make a squeeze. 

The full offer can be found here:
[Link to offer for Kahoot!](https://kahoot.com/investor/announcements/agreement-for-launch-of-a-recommended-all-cash-offer-of-nok-35-per-share-to-the-shareholders-of-kahoot-asa/)

Any advice would be very welcome? Can I end up with shares in a private company in case I vote no?

I believe these are the most important paragraphs:

“Minimum Acceptance: valid acceptance of the Offer by Shareholders representing (when taken together with any Shares acquired or agreed to be acquired by the Offeror other than through the Offer, or which the Offeror is otherwise entitled) more than 90% of the issued and outstanding share capital and voting rights of Kahoot!, and such acceptances not being subject to any third party consents in respect to pledges or other rights”

“If as a result of the Offer, the Offeror acquires and holds more than 90% of all Shares representing more than 90% of the voting rights in Kahoot!, the Offeror will have the right and intends to carry out a compulsory acquisition of the remaining Shares.“

“In total, Shares representing c.34.20% of Kahoot!’s outstanding share capital as at the date of this announcement (the “Outstanding Share Capital”) are committed to be sold”

“The largest Shareholder, General Atlantic, a leading global growth equity firm, alongside other Shareholders including KIRKBI, Glitrafjord AS (vehicle controlled by Kahoot!’s CEO Eilert Hanoa), certain other investors and certain members of the Kahoot! management team (including via a pooling vehicle) have entered into an investment agreement with Goldman Sachs Asset Management (the “Investment Agreement”) in which they, on certain terms and conditions, agree to (i) contribute, upon completion of the Offer, certain of their Shares representing c.26.68% of the Outstanding Share Capital”

I read the above as 61% is secured but the group is lacking 29% to make a squeeze. I don’t see other details in the offer that these 29% should be secured but am I wrong?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking advice,&lt;/p&gt;

But the company released a gloomy outlook for its fiscal 2024 sales that fell short of Wall Street’s estimates.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.37 vs. $1.32 expected

Revenue: $20.55 billion vs. $19.98 billion expected

The Tide detergent owner reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $3.38 billion, or $1.37 per share, up from $3.05 billion, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier.

Net sales rose 5% to $20.55 billion.

For fiscal 2024, P&amp;G is forecasting that its revenue will grow 3% to 4%, lower than Wall Street’s expectations of 4.5% sales growth. The company is also projecting earnings per share growth of 6% to 9%, which is on the lower end of analysts’ forecast of 8.8%.

#[Stock futures are higher as investors look toward Fed’s favorite inflation gauge: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures ticked up early Friday as Wall Street awaited new inflation data due Friday morning.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 57 points, or 0.16% higher. S&amp;P 500 futures were up by 0.38%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.77%.
*****
&gt; A mixed batch of earnings reports sent stocks in diverging directions after hours. Intel jumped more than 7% as investors applauded a return to profitability, while Roku climbed 8% after beating Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines.
*****
&gt; Ford Motor shares, however, fell about 1.4% even though the automaker beat estimates and raised guidance. The company said its electric vehicle adoption was taking longer than expected due to higher costs.
*****
&gt; Investors will watch for June data for the personal consumption expenditures price index, a gauge of inflation that’s closely followed by the Federal Reserve. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect that the core PCE gained 0.2% from the prior month and climbed 4.2% when compared with a year earlier.
*****
&gt; The data is of particular interest after the central bank raised interest rates earlier this week in a widely expected move. The Fed targets inflation at 2% annually.
*****
&gt; “We don’t have to love the Fed, but we know how they think,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. “Given that most people think the Fed won’t increase again, if this PCE number comes in hot, then that’s going to shake that confidence. We think it’s going to print cool, but you never know until you know.”
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a losing session. The Dow’s nearly 0.7% tumble marked the end of a 13-day win streak, a length not seen since 1987. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each finished around 0.6% lower.
*****
&gt; The Dow and the Nasdaq are on pace for narrow weekly gains. The 30-stock average is up 0.16%, while the tech-heavy index has a 0.12% gain through Thursday’s close. The S&amp;P 500 is flat on the week, up only 0.02%.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere on Friday, investors will watch for data on employment costs, personal income, consumer spending and consumer sentiment. Corporate earnings season continues with Procter &amp; Gamble, expected to report before the bell.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

270,stocks,"Due to expenses related to their merger with Sprint, T-Mobile US, Inc. has had negative EPS for three years in a row. Due to management's successful handling of the integration, TMUS is well-positioned to start reaping the rewards of their merger with Sprint. Since 2020, TMUS has spent a lot of money attempting to merge the two businesses. With approximately $4.9 billion in merger-related costs, 2022 was the most expensive year to date. This procedure has hurt the company's bottom line, but the corporation is now moving towards a situation where the advantages will start to exceed the disadvantages.   
The management anticipates that the final $1 billion in merger-related costs will be mostly recovered by the end of 2023, according to the most recent annual report. However, according to latest management projections, merger synergies will be realised in the range of 7.3 and 7.5 billion in 2023. Overall, it appears that the merger went fairly well because management was able to keep expenditures under control for three to four years while also adding 40 million new users to its platform. As a result, I predict that TMUS's financial performance will significantly increase during the coming years.  
Nonetheless, there are still some risks to the company itself. In the industry where TMUS competes, there are only a few dominant companies. Profitability can suffer if several smaller firms are successful in breaking into the market. Their debt-to-equity ratio right now is 1.64x. Despite not being ideal, it is not out of the ordinary for the sector. 9.8 billion in current debt and 9.6 billion in cash are held by the corporation. However, with over 98 billion in long-term debt, it is the majority of the debt. Despite these dangers, TMUS expects to boost profitability in 2023 as a result of cost savings and increased synergies from their most recent merger.

277,stocks,"###If Fed achieves a soft landing, history suggests economy could keep growing four or five more years

Economic expansions don’t die of old age, economists like to say; they are murdered by the Federal Reserve.

No wonder, then, that as the Fed has raised interest rates 5.25 percentage points since early last year, including a quarter point Wednesday, forecasters have predicted a recession was imminent. 

But they have postponed the recession’s start date as growth remains steady. The economy grew a better-than-expected 2.4%, annualized, in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.

Actually, in one respect a recession in the next six months would be unusual. It would mean the current expansion, which began in April 2020, will have lasted just four years. That is less than half the 8.6-year average of the four prior expansions, dating back to 1982.

This shows what is at stake in the Fed’s current balancing act. It hopes rates have risen enough to push inflation down, but not enough to push the economy into contraction—a so-called soft landing. Based on the actuarial tables, a soft landing would mean another four or five years before the next recession. 

On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a soft landing has long been his base case, and his confidence in it had grown. “We’ve seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market,” he told reporters after the Fed’s policy meeting. “That’s a really good thing.” 

Powell also disclosed that the Fed staff, which earlier this year projected a recession, no longer does. The staff forecast doesn’t necessarily reflect policy makers’ own views. 

The second-quarter report on gross domestic product also helped the case for a soft landing. The 2.4% growth rate was faster than the economy’s long-run trend, mostly thanks to business investment. Consumer spending grew a relatively subdued 1.6%. Inflation excluding food and energy, by the Fed’s preferred measure, was lower than economists expected, at 3.8% annualized for the quarter. Though still far above the Fed’s 2% target, that was still the lowest in over two years.

***A pre-1981 or post-1981 business cycle?***

The prospects of avoiding a recession depend on what sort of business cycle this is. Since 1945, there have been 12 expansions and 13 recessions, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the academic organization that dates business cycles.

Until 1981, expansions lasted an average of 3.7 years and usually ended because the Fed raised interest rates in response to some combination of an overheating economy and inflation. 

But in 1981, then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker engineered a deep recession, and inflation began a long decline, eventually stabilizing around 2%. In 1984 and again in 1994, the Fed raised rates before inflation actually took off, and the economy kept growing for six more years.

Several factors extended the lifespan of expansions. Globalization, brisk labor-force growth and technology put downward pressure on costs. As the public came to expect lower inflation, they set wages and prices accordingly. Spikes in oil prices petered out without feeding a broader wage-price spiral. Low inflation’s self-sustaining nature meant less need for recessions to lower it. 

The four expansions since 1981 have ranged from six to nearly 11 years. Instead of inflation, they usually ended with some sort of financial crackup: the technology bust in 2001, or the bursting of the housing and mortgage bubble in 2007. 

The record, near-11 year expansion that ended in February 2020 was unique, killed off not by inflation or a financial crisis, but by a pandemic and lockdowns. Without that, it might still be going on.  

[**Number of years of each economic expansion**](https://i.imgur.com/sIuFiLM.png)

So does the current cycle have more in common with the shorter, pre-1981 vintage, or the longer, post-1981 type? If the latter, the good news is that the vulnerabilities and imbalances that led to financial meltdowns in the past seem absent now. The financial system survived the pandemic shutdown in early 2020.

Higher interest rates usually lead to some unforeseen financial crunch. This time, they sank three regional banks earlier this year. But so far, contagion has been limited and the hit to bank lending seems modest.

In a report this week, Bank of America economists said much of the risk of rising interest rates has been absorbed by either the Fed or banks through their purchases of Treasury bonds, whose prices fell as rates rose. The good news is, “the Fed has the mandate, the tools, the acumen, the data, and the experience to tackle emergent stresses in the banking system.”

***A plausible case that this time is different ***

On its face, the current cycle looks a lot like those of the 1960s and 1970s: overheated, and afflicted with inflation.

When the Fed pulled off the 1984 and 1994 soft landings, unemployment was much higher than today’s 3.6%, and wages were growing moderately. In other words, the labor market wasn’t overheating. By contrast, as Powell noted, the demand for workers today is still well above the supply. 

The Fed has never pulled off a soft landing when inflation was so far above its goal and the labor market this overheated. 

Still, there is a plausible case this time is different. In the past, inflation was usually caused by excess demand. This time, a bigger culprit is disrupted supply—of goods, transportation, commodities, labor—in the wake of the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Supply is returning. Vehicle production, previously held back by a shortage of semiconductors, soared 20%, annualized, in the second quarter. This enabled businesses to sharply boost investment in equipment, even as prices for that equipment fell for the first time in two years.

Meanwhile, robust demand for workers has been met by a surge in supply: The share of the population aged 25 to 54 either working or looking for work—the participation rate—is now higher than before the recession.

And despite tight labor markets, a wage price spiral isn’t yet apparent. Unlike before 1981, the public’s long-term expectations of inflation are stable, at around 2% to 3%.

On the negative side, structural factors that restrained costs in past decades have reversed: Thanks to geopolitical tensions and protectionism, globalization has gone into reverse, and aging populations have sapped labor-force growth. Maybe artificial intelligence will supercharge productivity, but for now that is purely hypothetical. 

These forces mean that even if the Fed gets inflation down without killing the economy in the coming year, the stay of execution isn’t guaranteed to last.

For the period ending July 1, Intel (INTC) earned an adjusted 13 cents per share on $12.9B in revenue, as the company's Client Computing Group generated $6.78B in revenue, above estimates. 

Revenue attributed to its Data Center and AI group fell 15% year-over-year to $4B, while Network and Edge revenue dropped 38% to $1.4B. Intel's nascent foundry unit saw a 307% surge in revenue to $232M.

The company also generated $454M in revenue attributed to Mobileye (MBLY), which it partially spun-off in October 2022.

A consensus of analysts expected  the company to lose 3 cents per share on $12.14B in revenue.

AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose in after-hours trading following the results.

Looking ahead, Intel (INTC) said it expects third-quarter revenue to be between $12.9B and $13.9B, with the mid-point above the $13.28B estimate. It also expects adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share, topping the 13-cent-per-share estimate.

The Santa, Clara, California-based Intel (INTC) also said it is on track to deliver $3B in cost savings this year.

*ENPH announces share repurchase program*

ENPH announced today that its Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to $1.0 billion of shares of its common stock.

“Given our confidence in our long-term strategy and the value we see in our stock, our board has authorized an additional $1.0 billion for share repurchases,” said Badri Kothandaraman, president and CEO of Enphase Energy. “Our significant free cash flow generation allows us to continue investing for the long term, while also opportunistically buying back stock through a repurchase program.”

Sadly, those losses have pretty much become par for the course. **The NBCUniversal streaming platform lost $704 million in the prior quarter (and $467 million in Q2 2022). The company expects to post “peak” losses from streaming — to the tune of $3 billion — in 2023.** Good thing Comcast is soon to come into about $9 billion in streaming bucks through the sale of its Hulu stake to Disney.

Peacock revenue rose 85 percent year to year, mostly thanks to advertising, as the vast majority of subs are on the service’s “Premium” tier. Until recently (and since its June 2020 launch), the ad-supported option cost $4.99 per month; following a July price hike it’s now $5.99. Commercial-free “Premium Plus” increased from $9.99/month to $11.99/month.

NBCU parent company Comcast did top Wall Street’s earnings and revenue expectations for the second quarter of 2023. Media analysts collectively forecast Comcast’s Q2 earnings at 97 cents per share on revenue of $30.13 billion. The company reported $1.13 of adjusted earnings per share (or $1.02 without adjustments) on $30.51 billion in revenue. Net income was $4.72 billion.

In a prepared statement, Comcast’s Chairman and CEO Brian L. Roberts called the financial results “excellent.” He shouted out Theme Parks for their “best quarterly adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) ever.”

He’ll have much more to say at 8:30 a.m. today, when Comcast’s senior executive team hosts a conference call to discuss the quarterly results in greater detail. We expect some strikes talk, and about a half-million mentions of “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” Hey, Universal Pictures has earned it.

“Mario,” an April 5 release, made more than a half-billion dollars domestically and more than $1.3 billion at the worldwide box office. It almost single-handedly sent the quarter’s theatrical revenue soaring 66 percent vs. the same three-month period in 2022.

Hello all, I was beating the drum on TUP since $1.33. Looks like we had a nice little pop. I have liquidated almost all of my holdings in TUP. Currently holding 25 shares at $2.00. I have 1 put at $2 as well. I like to buy put options close to or ATM w/ long positions in stock. Nice little hedge to protect you from any downside.

My next speculative call is LCID. As of July 14. There are 2.27B shares Outs. Float of 406,097,447. Short Interest 167,766,715, roughly 41%. I do not necessarily see this as a squeeze yet. However, Bank of America just announced  that $90/ barrel is imminent. The oil supply in the US has drastically been declining. This will lead to higher prices for anything utilizing oil (Plastic, Gas, Polyurethane, Solvents, ETC.) This usually leads to people searching for cheaper alternatives.  Which is why LCID (EV in general) and anything pertaining to oil is on my watchlist. I wouldn't be surprised to see a dip and rip with anything oil. 


WMT, I have been watching for quite some time now (over a year). I have a fairly large position in Walmart (over 100)  at strikes from $165-$220, about 90% expiring Dec.. Walmart started in January 2022 developing their own crypto coin. The CTO of Walmart, in October of 22' said he expects crypto to be a major payment disruptor and a very important payment tool to use. In June of 2023, they opened their second automation facility. If that isn't enough, Walmart is a major contributor in the AI industry. They have embedded AI all over their facilities and have been buying AI IP. The  FTC is also looking into Amazons rigged search results and how they advertise for business owners. Sounds like they are forcing businesses to pay more for a higher product ranking. This is among a slew of other antitrust violations. amazon could be a great short with Walmart gaining market share. If the FTC follows through on their Amazon lawsuit and they succeed at breaking up amazon. It stands to reason that Walmart will gain the majority of Amazons market share.

291,stocks,"In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.

He soon realized he was sometimes getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.

“We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter.

Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.”

What Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.

The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter.

Inside the Nevada team’s office, some employees celebrated canceling service appointments by putting their phones on mute and striking a metal xylophone, triggering applause from coworkers who sometimes stood on desks. The team often closed hundreds of cases a week and staffers were tracked on their average number of diverted appointments per day.

Managers told the employees that they were saving Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on service centers, some of which had long waits for appointments.

In most cases, the complaining customers’ cars likely did not need repair, according to the people familiar with the matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints another way – by hyping the range of its futuristic electric vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and the projections provided by the cars’ own equipment, according to Reuters interviews with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the company’s vehicles.

Neither Tesla nor Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for this story.

Reuters reporter Steve Stecklow discusses how Tesla has been exaggerating the driving range of its vehicles for years.
Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles’ potential driving distance – by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers “rosy” projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts.

Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a “safety buffer,” allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.

The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said.

“Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,” the person said, adding: “When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.”

Tesla’s intentional inflation of in-dash range-meter projections and the creation of its range-complaints diversion team have not been previously reported.

Driving range is among the most important factors in consumer decisions on which electric car to buy, or whether to buy one at all. So-called range anxiety – the fear of running out of power before reaching a charger – has been a primary obstacle to boosting electric-vehicle sales.

At the time Tesla programmed in the rosy range projections, it was selling only two models: the two-door Roadster, its first vehicle, which was later discontinued; and the Model S, a luxury sport sedan launched in 2012. It now sells four models: two cars, the 3 and S; and two crossover SUVs, the X and Y. Tesla plans the return of the Roadster, along with a “Cybertruck” pickup.

Reuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates. But automotive testers and regulators continue to flag the company for exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel before their batteries run out.

Tesla was fined earlier this year by South Korean regulators who found the cars delivered as little as half their advertised range in cold weather. Another recent study found that three Tesla models averaged 26% below their advertised ranges.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required Tesla since the 2020 model year to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to advertise for six of its vehicles by an average of 3%. The EPA told Reuters, however, that it expects some variation between the results of separate tests conducted by automakers and the agency.

Data collected in 2022 and 2023 from more than 8,000 Teslas by Recurrent, a Seattle-based EV analytics company, showed that the cars’ dashboard range meters didn’t change their estimates to reflect hot or cold outside temperatures, which can greatly reduce range.

Recurrent found that Tesla’s four models almost always calculated that they could travel more than 90% of their advertised EPA range estimates regardless of external temperatures. Scott Case, Recurrent’s chief executive, told Reuters that Tesla’s range meters also ignore many other conditions affecting driving distance.

Electric cars can lose driving range for a lot of the same reasons as gasoline cars — but to a greater degree. The cold is a particular drag on EVs, slowing the chemical and physical reactions inside their batteries and requiring a heating system to protect them. Other drains on the battery include hilly terrain, headwinds, a driver’s lead foot and running the heating or air-conditioning inside the cabin.

Tesla discusses the general effect of such conditions in a “Range Tips” section of its website. The automaker also recently updated its vehicle software to provide a breakdown of battery consumption during recent trips with suggestions on how range might have been improved.

Tesla vehicles provide range estimates in two ways: One through a dashboard meter of current range that’s always on, and a second projection through its navigation system, which works when a driver inputs a specific destination. The navigation system’s range estimate, Case said, does account for a wider set of conditions, including temperature. While those estimates are “more realistic,” they still tend to overstate the distance the car can travel before it needs to be recharged, he said.

Recurrent tested other automakers’ in-dash range meters –  including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Hyundai Kona – and found them to be more accurate. The Kona’s range meter generally underestimated the distance the car could travel, the tests showed. Recurrent conducted the study with the help of a National Science Foundation grant.

Tesla, Case said, has consistently designed the range meters in its cars to deliver aggressive rather than conservative estimates: “That’s where Tesla has taken a different path from most other automakers.”

Failed tests and false advertising

Tesla isn’t the only automaker with cars that don’t regularly achieve their advertised ranges.

One of the experts, Gregory Pannone, co-authored a study of 21 different brands of electric vehicles, published in April by SAE International, an engineering organization. The research found that, on average, the cars fell short of their advertised ranges by 12.5% in highway driving.

The study did not name the brands tested, but Pannone told Reuters that three Tesla models posted the worst performance, falling short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26%.

The EV pioneer pushes the limits of government testing regulations that govern the claims automakers put on window stickers, the three automotive experts told Reuters.

Like their gas-powered counterparts, new electric vehicles are required by U.S. federal law to display a label with fuel-efficiency information. In the case of EVs, this is stated in miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe), allowing consumers to compare them to gasoline or diesel vehicles. The labels also include estimates of total range: how far an EV can travel on a full charge, in combined city and highway driving.

“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.”

EV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model’s range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran.

Tesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA’s formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said.

Mercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA’s formula because it believes it provides a more accurate estimate. “We follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,” the German carmaker said in a statement.

Ford and Porsche didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Whatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year.

EPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars’ estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla’s range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers.

The EPA said it has seen “everything” in its audits of EV manufacturers’ range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers. “That is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market  and why EPA prioritizes” auditing them, the agency said.

The EPA cautioned that individuals’ actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles.

Pannone called Tesla “the most aggressive” electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations.

“I’m not suggesting they’re cheating,” Pannone said of Tesla. “What they’re doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.”

Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.

All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.

Tesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla’s in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.

Only two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds reported in March 2021. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.

Edmunds has continued to test electric vehicles, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.

“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,” Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can “misrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.”

South Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars’ range. It cited tests by the country’s environment ministry that showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company’s claimed ranges in cold weather.

The KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla’s website, including one that claimed about a particular model: “You can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.” Regulators required Tesla to remove the “or longer” phrase.

Korean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging “false/exaggerated advertising.”

Creating a diversion

By last year, sales of Tesla’s electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.

As sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team’s operations.

Tesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its “virtual” service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.

Tesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla “Virtual Service Advisor” described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: “Divert customers who do not require in person service.”

Such advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the Las Vegas “Diversion Team” to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.

The office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had purchased the metallophone – a xylophone with metal keys – that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office’s operations.

Advisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers’ cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range. Advisors would offer tips on extending range by changing driving habits.

If the remote diagnostics found anything else wrong with the vehicle that was not related to driving range, advisors were instructed not to tell the customer, one of the sources said. Managers told them to close the cases.

Tesla also updated its phone app so that any customer who complained about range could no longer book service appointments, one of the sources said. Instead, they could request that someone from Tesla contact them. It often took several days before owners were contacted because of the large backlog of range complaints, the source said.


Tesla recently stopped owners from using its app to book service appointments relating to complaints about driving range. Instead, it gave them tips on increasing range and directed their inquiries to a “Diversion Team” tasked with preventing service-center visits.
The update routed all U.S. range complaints to the Nevada diversion team, which started in Las Vegas and later moved to the nearby suburb of Henderson. The team was soon fielding up to 2,000 cases a week, which sometimes included multiple complaints from customers frustrated they couldn't book a service appointment, one of the people said.

The team was expected to close about 750 cases a week. To accomplish that, office supervisors told advisers to call a customer once and, if there was no answer, to close the case as unresponsive, the source said. When customers did respond, advisers were told to try to complete the call in no more than five minutes.

In late 2022, managers aiming to quickly close cases told advisors to stop running remote diagnostic tests on the vehicles of owners who had reported range problems, according to one of the people familiar with the diversion team’s operations.

“Thousands of customers were told there is nothing wrong with their car” by advisors who had never run diagnostics, the person said.

Reuters could not establish how long the practice continued.

Tesla recently stopped using its diversion team in Nevada to handle range-related complaints, according to the person familiar with the matter. Virtual service advisors in an office in Utah are now handling range cases, the person said. Reuters could not determine why the change was made.


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signs off on fuel economy and driving range estimates.

The EPA required Tesla to slightly lower driving range estimates that it planned to put on window stickers for six recent models after the agency’s own testing. But the EPA said such variation is not uncommon in testing by makers of electric vehicles.
On the road

By the time Alexandre Ponsin reached California on his March road trip, he had stopped to charge his Model 3’s battery about a dozen times.

Concerned that something was seriously wrong with the car, he had called and texted with several Tesla representatives. One of them booked the first available appointment in Santa Clara – about two weeks away – but advised him to show up at a Tesla service center as soon as he arrived in California.

Ponsin soon received a text saying that remote diagnostics had shown his battery “is in good health.”

“We would like to cancel your visit for now if you have no other concerns,” the text read.

“Of course I still have concerns,” Ponsin shot back. “I have 150 miles of range on a full charge!”

The next day, he received another text message asking him to cancel the appointment. “I am sorry, but no I do not want to close the service appointment as I do not feel my concerns have been addressed,” he replied.

Undeterred, Ponsin brought his car to the Santa Clara service center without an appointment. A technician there told him the car was fine. “It lasted 10 minutes,” Ponsin said, “and they didn’t even look at the car physically.”

After doing more research into range estimates, he said he ultimately concluded there is nothing wrong with his car. The problem, he said, was that Tesla is overstating its performance. He believes Tesla “should be a lot more explicit about the variation in the range,” especially in very cold weather.

“I do love my Tesla,” the engineer said. “But I have just tempered my expectation of what it can do in certain conditions.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3.

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla’s in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds reported in March 2021. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edmunds has continued to test electric vehicles, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They&amp;#39;ve gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,” Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can “misrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars’ range. It cited tests by the country’s environment ministry that showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company’s claimed ranges in cold weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla’s website, including one that claimed about a particular model: “You can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.” Regulators required Tesla to remove the “or longer” phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging “false/exaggerated advertising.”&lt;/p&gt;

Creating a diversion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By last year, sales of Tesla’s electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team’s operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its “virtual” service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla “Virtual Service Advisor” described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: “Divert customers who do not require in person service.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the Las Vegas “Diversion Team” to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had purchased the metallophone – a xylophone with metal keys – that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office’s operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers’ cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range. Advisors would offer tips on extending range by changing driving habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the remote diagnostics found anything else wrong with the vehicle that was not related to driving range, advisors were instructed not to tell the customer, one of the sources said. Managers told them to close the cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla also updated its phone app so that any customer who complained about range could no longer book service appointments, one of the sources said. Instead, they could request that someone from Tesla contact them. It often took several days before owners were contacted because of the large backlog of range complaints, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla recently stopped owners from using its app to book service appointments relating to complaints about driving range. Instead, it gave them tips on increasing range and directed their inquiries to a “Diversion Team” tasked with preventing service-center visits.
The update routed all U.S. range complaints to the Nevada diversion team, which started in Las Vegas and later moved to the nearby suburb of Henderson. The team was soon fielding up to 2,000 cases a week, which sometimes included multiple complaints from customers frustrated they couldn&amp;#39;t book a service appointment, one of the people said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team was expected to close about 750 cases a week. To accomplish that, office supervisors told advisers to call a customer once and, if there was no answer, to close the case as unresponsive, the source said. When customers did respond, advisers were told to try to complete the call in no more than five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2022, managers aiming to quickly close cases told advisors to stop running remote diagnostic tests on the vehicles of owners who had reported range problems, according to one of the people familiar with the diversion team’s operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thousands of customers were told there is nothing wrong with their car” by advisors who had never run diagnostics, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters could not establish how long the practice continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla recently stopped using its diversion team in Nevada to handle range-related complaints, according to the person familiar with the matter. Virtual service advisors in an office in Utah are now handling range cases, the person said. Reuters could not determine why the change was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signs off on fuel economy and driving range estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPA required Tesla to slightly lower driving range estimates that it planned to put on window stickers for six recent models after the agency’s own testing. But the EPA said such variation is not uncommon in testing by makers of electric vehicles.
On the road&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time Alexandre Ponsin reached California on his March road trip, he had stopped to charge his Model 3’s battery about a dozen times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerned that something was seriously wrong with the car, he had called and texted with several Tesla representatives. One of them booked the first available appointment in Santa Clara – about two weeks away – but advised him to show up at a Tesla service center as soon as he arrived in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ponsin soon received a text saying that remote diagnostics had shown his battery “is in good health.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We would like to cancel your visit for now if you have no other concerns,” the text read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Of course I still have concerns,” Ponsin shot back. “I have 150 miles of range on a full charge!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, he received another text message asking him to cancel the appointment. “I am sorry, but no I do not want to close the service appointment as I do not feel my concerns have been addressed,” he replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undeterred, Ponsin brought his car to the Santa Clara service center without an appointment. A technician there told him the car was fine. “It lasted 10 minutes,” Ponsin said, “and they didn’t even look at the car physically.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing more research into range estimates, he said he ultimately concluded there is nothing wrong with his car. The problem, he said, was that Tesla is overstating its performance. He believes Tesla “should be a lot more explicit about the variation in the range,” especially in very cold weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I do love my Tesla,” the engineer said. “But I have just tempered my expectation of what it can do in certain conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;

A huge chunk of consumer debt still carries fixed rates made before 2022.

In the depths of the pandemic, Alex and Cynthia Durbin refinanced their mortgage at 2.75%. They built up their savings by spending less, then paid off a car loan and student debt.

That meant the family’s balance sheet didn’t take a hit when the Federal Reserve started aggressively raising interest rates last year in an effort to cool inflation. The Fed on Wednesday raised rates to a 22-year high, the 11th increase since March 2022. Though most things cost more now, the Durbins still have room in their budget to dine out with their three young children and go on vacation a few times a year. 

“It’s given us a tremendous amount of breathing room,” Durbin said of his 

Americans locked in ultralow rates on debt such as mortgages and auto loans in the decade-plus that followed the 2008 financial crisis. Though rates on some loans such as credit cards are rising with the Fed’s hikes, a huge chunk of consumer debt carries the low yields on offer a few years ago. That has allowed many households to continue spending, which has kept the economy going strong despite predictions of a recession. 

As of the first quarter, only 11% of outstanding household debt carried rates that fluctuated with benchmark interest rates, according to Moody’s Analytics. That metric has hovered around this historically low level for over a decade. But it only started to matter when the Fed began its campaign. 

Fixed-rate debt became more common after the 2008 crisis, when lenders turned away from products such as adjustable-rate mortgages and home-equity lines of credit that played a role in the bust. Households have also spent the past decade-plus loading up on auto and student loans, which typically carry fixed rates.

Households would have to pay 9.6% of their disposable income to stay current on their debts in the first quarter, according to the Fed. That is above where it was in the depths of the pandemic but below the postcrisis average. 

The prevalence of fixed-rate debt is likely blunting the impact of the central bank’s moves. Economic growth and consumer spending remain mostly solid. One popular gauge suggests that the Fed’s moves are having less of an effect on financial conditions than earlier this year. 

“It’s one reason why consumers are hanging tough and the Fed’s rate hikes have taken less of a bite out of the economy,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. 

Americans who refinanced their mortgages for a better rate since March 2020 have saved $42 billion on their monthly payments, Black Knight estimates. 

Some who nabbed low rates do feel stuck in place: Upgrading to the next home or car is now prohibitively expensive. The national housing market is paralyzed by homeowners who aren’t moving because they don’t want to give up their cheap mortgages. 

Alex Durbin, who is 36 and works in private-wealth management, said his family of five is outgrowing their three-bedroom home in the Columbus, Ohio, area. They bought a plot of land for a new home but, with mortgage rates around 7%, they can’t afford to build the house they want. “We’re in this weird limbo state,” he said. 

Durbin said they could also use a car with more space, but they plan to stick with their paid-off Honda Odyssey minivan with 135,000 miles for now. “I don’t even want to think about what it would cost to finance,” he said. 

Still, the cheap, fixed-rate debt has generally put borrowers in a better financial position. Many bought properties that have already risen in value. Some are also taking advantage of higher rates on savings accounts and Treasurys—making them overall winners in the central bank’s campaign.

Michael and Niki Reznicek weren’t planning on buying a home in 2021. But after the pandemic prompted the Fed to cut rates to near zero and mortgage rates fell, they put their savings toward a down payment on a Chicago townhome. Their mortgage rate was around 3.25%. In today’s market, they wouldn’t be able to buy the same home. 

Their spending has mostly stayed the same. “I still go get my Starbucks, we still go out and tip 20 to 25 percent at restaurants,” said Michael Reznicek, who is 28 and works in financial technology. The couple does look for sale items at the grocery store more frequently, he said.

Gary Marsh, 66, paid cash to build his Sonoma County, Calif., home in 2020 and the following year took out a 2.75% mortgage on the property that provided him with a lump sum of about $300,000. He recently put those funds into certificates of deposit at local banks paying about 4.75%. 

“The low mortgage rate has allowed me to work less, travel more and mostly to feel more free than I ever have,” said Marsh, a writer for real-estate companies.

'They're putting a soft landing back on the table,' one economist says

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate to a range of 5.25%-5.5%. the highest level in 22 years in order to combat ""elevated"" inflation.

With financial markets and economists widely expecting the move, the focus was on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's one-hour session with reporters. Here are the four key takeaways from Powell's presser:

Fed staff is no longer forecasting a recession

During the press conference, Powell made news by saying the Fed staff is now forecasting a ""noticeable slowdown"" rather than a recession. The reason for the shift, Powell said, is that the staff has seen the recent resiliency in the economic data.

Powell said he also thinks the Fed can bring inflation down ""without the kind of really significant downturn.""

Ordinarily, we would have had to wait until Aug. 16, when the Fed releases a summary of its two-day meeting, to get a read on the staff's economic forecast.

""They're putting a soft landing back on the table,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist of PNC Financial Services Group.

Banks are not aggressively tightening lending standards

Ever since Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March, economists have been worried that other banks will pull back on lending and raise loan standards. So far, there has been a steady reduction in lending but no dramatic moves. The Fed keeps an eye on loan standards in quarterly surveys with bank officers.

The latest report is due next week, but Powell gave us a sneak preview, saying that lending conditions are tighter but not in an alarming fashion. ""I would just say it is broadly consistent with what you'd expect. You've got lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter,"" he said.

Powell said credit conditions were a headwind facing the economy.

Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe General, said her team thinks the Fed will not hike rates further, citing tighter lending starts and tighter credit standards as indicating they are done.

Why did Powell refuse to bite about 'one final hike' in September?

In June, the Fed forecast two more 25-basis-point rate hikes this year.

With one taken care of Wednesday, Powell was offered the opportunity to hint that the Fed was leaning toward a final rate hike in September. But he ""steadfastly refused to bite,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America Economist at Capital Economics.

Powell also pushed back on the idea that the Fed is now on an ""every-other-meeting"" hiking schedule, which would imply a final hike at the start of November.

Vince Reinhart, a former top Fed staffer and now chief economist at Dreyfus and Mellon, said he thought Powell is a chair ""behind his committee."" While Powell wants to skip a hike in September, there are too many members of the Fed who are uncomfortable with such a signal, so Powell couldn't say it, he said.

""Powell is comfortable putting a policy-rate move off to November. Some people are less comfortable,"" Reinhart said.

On the other hand, Omair Sharif. the president of Inflation Insights, said it might have been hawkish that Powell never mentioned ""one more hike"" at all.

Sharif said this raised the possibility that there might be more than one hike before the Fed says it is done.

After the meeting, traders in derivatives markets saw only a 40% chance of a rate hike by November.

Powell suggests bar for another hike is high

Powell did show his dovish colors a little bit when he said ""we've covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.""

Fed officials who are pressing for more rate hikes have said they do not expect many more ""effects"" on the economy from previous hikes.

""To the extent that the Fed views policy lags as relatively long, it suggests that they are going to be very careful in trying to avoid overtightening from here,"" said Thomas Simons, an economist at Jefferies.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/202307261107/fed-no-longer-sees-a-recession-and-other-things-we-learned-from-powells-press-conference""&gt;https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/202307261107/fed-no-longer-sees-a-recession-and-other-things-we-learned-from-powells-press-conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;They&amp;#39;re putting a soft landing back on the table,&amp;#39; one economist says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate to a range of 5.25%-5.5%. the highest level in 22 years in order to combat &amp;quot;elevated&amp;quot; inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With financial markets and economists widely expecting the move, the focus was on Fed Chair Jerome Powell&amp;#39;s one-hour session with reporters. Here are the four key takeaways from Powell&amp;#39;s presser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fed staff is no longer forecasting a recession&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the press conference, Powell made news by saying the Fed staff is now forecasting a &amp;quot;noticeable slowdown&amp;quot; rather than a recession. The reason for the shift, Powell said, is that the staff has seen the recent resiliency in the economic data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powell said he also thinks the Fed can bring inflation down &amp;quot;without the kind of really significant downturn.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, we would have had to wait until Aug. 16, when the Fed releases a summary of its two-day meeting, to get a read on the staff&amp;#39;s economic forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re putting a soft landing back on the table,&amp;quot; said Gus Faucher, chief economist of PNC Financial Services Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks are not aggressively tightening lending standards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March, economists have been worried that other banks will pull back on lending and raise loan standards. So far, there has been a steady reduction in lending but no dramatic moves. The Fed keeps an eye on loan standards in quarterly surveys with bank officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest report is due next week, but Powell gave us a sneak preview, saying that lending conditions are tighter but not in an alarming fashion. &amp;quot;I would just say it is broadly consistent with what you&amp;#39;d expect. You&amp;#39;ve got lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powell said credit conditions were a headwind facing the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe General, said her team thinks the Fed will not hike rates further, citing tighter lending starts and tighter credit standards as indicating they are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did Powell refuse to bite about &amp;#39;one final hike&amp;#39; in September?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, the Fed forecast two more 25-basis-point rate hikes this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one taken care of Wednesday, Powell was offered the opportunity to hint that the Fed was leaning toward a final rate hike in September. But he &amp;quot;steadfastly refused to bite,&amp;quot; said Paul Ashworth, chief North America Economist at Capital Economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powell also pushed back on the idea that the Fed is now on an &amp;quot;every-other-meeting&amp;quot; hiking schedule, which would imply a final hike at the start of November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vince Reinhart, a former top Fed staffer and now chief economist at Dreyfus and Mellon, said he thought Powell is a chair &amp;quot;behind his committee.&amp;quot; While Powell wants to skip a hike in September, there are too many members of the Fed who are uncomfortable with such a signal, so Powell couldn&amp;#39;t say it, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Powell is comfortable putting a policy-rate move off to November. Some people are less comfortable,&amp;quot; Reinhart said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Omair Sharif. the president of Inflation Insights, said it might have been hawkish that Powell never mentioned &amp;quot;one more hike&amp;quot; at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharif said this raised the possibility that there might be more than one hike before the Fed says it is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the meeting, traders in derivatives markets saw only a 40% chance of a rate hike by November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powell suggests bar for another hike is high&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powell did show his dovish colors a little bit when he said &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;ve covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fed officials who are pressing for more rate hikes have said they do not expect many more &amp;quot;effects&amp;quot; on the economy from previous hikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To the extent that the Fed views policy lags as relatively long, it suggests that they are going to be very careful in trying to avoid overtightening from here,&amp;quot; said Thomas Simons, an economist at Jefferies.&lt;/p&gt;

We launched PlayStation 5 in November 2020 and the world was in a strange and different place than when we announced the console in 2019. Despite the unprecedented challenges of COVID, our teams and our partners worked diligently to deliver PS5 on time. We continued to face headwinds with the pandemic, and it took months for supply chains to normalize so we could have the inventory to keep up with demand. For more months than I care to remember, we kept thanking our community for their patience while working through these issues. But now PS5 supply is well-stocked and we are seeing that pent up demand finally being met.

With the support of PlayStation fans, we have reached a milestone of 40 million PS5 consoles sold through* to gamers since launch. Thank you so much to our community of gamers – without you this would have been an impossible task.

PS5 launched with the best catalog of games in our history and the momentum for great content keeps getting stronger. From innovative indie games to AAA blockbusters, there are more than 2,500 PS5 games now available, and it has never been a better time to experience PS5 In the last two months alone, we have seen incredible new games from our partners, including Final Fantasy XVI, Diablo IV, and Street Fighter 6.

The U.S. economy showed few signs of recession in the second quarter, as gross domestic product grew at a faster than expected pace during the period, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.

GDP, the sum of all goods and services activity, increased at a 2.4% annualized rate for the April-through-June period, better than the 2% consensus estimate from Dow Jones. GDP rose at a 2% pace in the first quarter.

Markets moved higher following the report, with stocks poised for a positive open and Treasury yields on the rise.

Consumer spending powered the solid quarter, aided by increases in nonresidential fixed investment, government spending and inventory growth.

Perhaps as important, inflation was held in check through the period. The personal consumption expenditures price index increased 2.6%, down from a 4.1% rise in the first quarter and well below the Dow Jones estimate for a gain of 3.2%.

Consumer spending, as gauged by the department’s personal consumption expenditures index, increased 1.6% and accounted for 68% of all economic activity during the quarter.

In the face of persistent calls for a recession, the economy showed surprising resilience despite a series of Federal Reserve interest rate increases that most Wall Street economists and even those at the central bank expect to cause a contraction.

Growth hasn’t posted a negative reading since the second quarter of 2022, when GDP fell at a 0.6% rate. That was the second straight quarter of negative growth, meeting the technical definition of a recession. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research is the official arbiter of expansion and contractions, and few expect it to call the period a recession.

Thursday’s report indicated widespread growth.

Gross private domestic investment increased by 5.7% after tumbling 11.9% in the first quarter. A 10.8% surge in equipment and a 9.7% increase in structures helped power that gain.

Government spending increased 2.6%, including a 2.5% jump in defense expenditures and 3.6% growth at the state and local levels.

Separate reports Thursday brought more positive economic news.

Durable goods orders for items such as vehicles, computers and appliances rose 4.7% in June, much higher than the 1.5% estimate, according to the Commerce Department. Also, weekly jobless claims totaled 221,000, a decline of 7,000 and below the 235,000 estimate.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/gdp-q2-2023-.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/gdp-q2-2023-.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Meta Platforms impressively exceeded expectations in Q2 2023, reporting strong earnings and revenue driven by the success of its AI-powered ad campaign. The company's stock surged 9% in premarket trading, reaching $325.53 ahead of Thursday's market opening. A robust rebound in the digital ad market and advertisers' growing confidence in Meta's AI capabilities contributed to its remarkable quarterly performance.

Looking ahead, Meta issued an optimistic revenue forecast for Q3 2023, anticipating revenues between $32 billion and $34.5 billion. Bernstein analysts described this guidance as a ""monster guidance,"" implying a potential year-over-year growth of at least 15%. Additionally, Meta's short-form video offering, Reels, achieved an impressive annual revenue run rate of over $10 billion in the latest quarter, demonstrating the platform's continued expansion and monetization.

Despite facing losses in its virtual world business division, Meta remains committed to its metaverse vision. CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated the company's dedication to investing in AI and advancing the metaverse concept, considering the two areas as overlapping and complementary.

319,stocks,"While the gaming world fixates on the implications of a Microsoft-Activision deal and AI, a smaller player in their universe may deserve a closer look from investors.Japanese game publisher Capcom Co.’s shares are up by a third this year, outpacing the broader Tokyo market and capping off a remarkable 1,200% surge over the past decade. That’s in part because the $11 billion company has punched well above its weight, spawning Hollywood franchises such as Resident Evil and Monster Hunter. 

The rally means Capcom, which reports earnings Wednesday, is trading at valuations well in excess of many of its biggest rivals from Konami Group Corp. to Bandai Namco Holdings Inc. It’s doing so despite lagging peers in the smartphone gaming arena, which now makes up half the industry’s sales. Of analysts covering the company, 7 rate it a hold and 10 a buy, with one sell.

Capcom is somewhat of an oddity in the $200 billion gaming industry. About 70% of its sales come from games released in the previous fiscal year or earlier, an unusually high proportion for an industry typically driven by new content, art and adventures. That’s helped the Osaka-based firm break the cycle of earnings volatility that depends on big new releases by capitalizing heavily on its back catalog of games, analysts said. 

Tapping underserved and developing markets, such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, with heavily discounted classic games has paid off. The profit margin on a $10 sale of an old game is effectively 100%, as all development costs have already been accounted for in earlier years. 

“Capcom has an extremely high operating profit margin and ROI which you can’t really find elsewhere, even outside Japan,” UBS Securities analyst Kenji Fukuyama said. Its gross margin is consistently better than peers, with last year’s 58.6% mark overshadowing Square Enix Holdings Co. (51.2%), Konami (38.9%) and Bandai Namco (37.2%). 

The firm sells software in 230 countries and regions, by far the largest number among Japanese publishers, according to Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda. It’s set a goal of selling 100 million copies per year, from the 41.7 million mark it set in the fiscal year ended March.

Capcom was early to convert its older console hits into digital downloads for PCs, and that’s helped it realize the lucrative strategy it relies on today, Fukuyama said. It’s also helped smooth out the massive swings in profits that business models relying on a constant flow of major new hits produce, making Capcom an investor darling. 

The stock is now the priciest in its peer group, when comparing enterprise value to earnings, but investors can’t find an off-ramp when growth has been so remarkably consistent, Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc. analyst Junko Yamamura said. The company grew its operating profit for the tenth straight year in March, reporting an 18% rise to ¥50.8 billion ($360 million).

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a much-anticipated interest rate hike that takes benchmark borrowing costs to their highest level in more than 22 years.

In a move that financial markets had completely priced in, the central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee raised its funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 5.25%-5.5%. The midpoint of that target range would be the highest level for the benchmark rate since early 2001.

Markets were watching for signs that the hike could be the last before Fed officials take a break to watch how the previous hikes are impacting economic conditions. While policymakers indicated at the June meeting that two rate hikes are coming this year, markets are pricing in a better-than-even chance that there won’t be any more moves this year.

The post-meeting statement offered only a vague reference to what will guide the FOMC’s future moves.

“The Committee will continue to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy,” the statement said in a line that was added from the previous months’ communication. That echoes a data-dependent approach – as opposed to a set schedule – that virtually all central bank officials have embraced in recent public statements.

 The hike received unanimous approval from voting committee members.

 The only other change of note in the statement was an upgrade of economic growth to “moderate” from “modest” at the June meeting despite expectations for at least a mild recession ahead. The statement again described inflation as “elevated” and job gains as “robust.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/fed-meeting-july-2023-.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/fed-meeting-july-2023-.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services. The other mega-cap tech companies are joining together to help create another option. A group formed by Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, along with TomTom, is releasing data that could enable companies to build their own maps, without having to rely on Google or Apple. The Overture Maps Foundation, which was established late last year, captured 59 million “points of interest,” such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders. The data has been cleaned and formatted so it can be used for free as the base layer for a new map application.

Meta and Microsoft collected and donated the data to Overture, according to Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF. Data on places is often difficult to collect and license, and building map data requires lots of time and staff to gather and clean it, he told CNBC in an interview. “We have some companies that, if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could,” Prioleau said. Rather than spending that kind of money, he said, companies were asking, “Can we just get collaboration around the open base map?” Overture is aiming to establish a baseline for maps data so that companies can use it to build and operate their own maps.

For many companies, Google’s and Apple’s maps aren’t ideal, because they don’t provide access to the underlying data. Instead, those companies allow app makers to use their maps as a service and, in many cases, charge each time the underlying map is accessed. For example, app makers pay per thousand Google Maps lookups through an application programming interface (API). Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, but web app developers need to pay. “That works for a lot of people, but not for others,” Prioleau said. Overture is only offering the underlying map data, leaving it up to companies to build their own software on top of it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/meta-microsoft-amazon-join-overture-maps-to-vie-with-apple-google.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/meta-microsoft-amazon-join-overture-maps-to-vie-with-apple-google.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

# [Stock futures slip as investors digest Big Tech earnings and await Fed decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/25/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell slightly Wednesday as investors weighed a batch of corporate earnings from major technology names and geared up for the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures fell slightly, while Nasdaq-100 futures slid 0.1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 60 points, or 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Google-parent Alphabet rose nearly 7% as cloud revenue growth helped propel the company to a better-than-expected quarter. On the other hand, Microsoft slid more than 3% after reporting slowing cloud revenue growth.
*****
&gt; Outside of Big Tech, Snap tumbled 19% after giving weak guidance for current-quarter performance.
*****
&gt; Investors are counting down to the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate policy decision and subsequent news conference with Chair Jerome Powell scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. The market is pricing in around a 98% chance the central bank raises interest rates, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool. That would mark a return to hikes after not increasing interest rates in June.
*****
&gt; “Investors will focus on the post meeting press conference and look for any clues about future policy path,” said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “Commentary from Chair Powell that would indicate more restrictive policy is required to bring inflation under control could dampen recent stock market optimism.”
*****
&gt; Wall Street notched a winning day Tuesday as investors reviewed the latest earnings and made adjustments with the Fed decision on the horizon. After eking out a gain just shy of 0.1%, the Dow clinched its 12th-straight winning session, a streak not seen since for the blue-chip average since February 2017. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite finished about 0.3% and 0.6% higher, respectively.
*****
&gt; Beyond the interest rate decision, investors will continue following the latest corporate financial releases on Wednesday. Coca-Cola, Stellantis, Boeing and AT&amp;T are among companies expected to report before the bell, while Meta, Chipotle and Mattel’s earnings are slated to drop after the market closes.

333,stocks,"**Bath &amp; Body Works (BBWI) persuaded companies throughout its supply chain to move to an Ohio city near its headquarters.**

*NEW ALBANY, Ohio—A $7.95 bottle of Bath &amp; Body Works foaming hand soap used to take three months to put together. The pieces had to travel more than 13,000 miles from China, Canada and Virginia to the company’s Ohio distribution center.*

*Bath &amp; Body Works decided it needed to get new products to market more quickly. The result was a production initiative with little parallel in corporate America.*

*Now every step of production occurs at plants just feet from each other on the company’s dedicated “beauty park” on the outskirts of Columbus. One factory makes the foaming pump and mechanism. Another makes the bottle itself, a third makes the label, a fourth makes the soap, fills the bottle, attaches the label and screws on the top. A fifth packages it. Getting a bottle to distribution is down to 21 days and a few miles. A majority of Bath &amp; Body Works products, which are sold in its own stores, are made on site.*


--------------------------


The effort, which started in 2008, required a lot of negotiation with sometimes skeptical suppliers. The campus includes 10 manufacturers and millions of square feet of production and warehouse spaces, with 5,000 employees working there during peak production. Bath &amp; Body Works had sales of $7.56 billion last year, increasing annual revenue by more than $2 billion since 2019.

“I look at BBW as a composer and a conductor of a symphony,” said Bath &amp; Body Works supply-chain executive Susanna Zhu. 

Bringing production closer to home, often called “reshoring,” has become a priority for many companies. Disruptions from Covid-19, severe weather, trade wars, geopolitical tensions and stuck ships left consumers without the couches and hot tubs they wanted. The Biden administration is spending hundreds of billions of dollars aimed at boosting the domestic presence of industries deemed strategic, including electric cars, batteries and semiconductors.

The government money, along with roaring consumer demand and persistent supply-chain issues, are leading to a factory building boom, with spending at its highest level in at least 20 years. Over the next decade, public and private investment will amount to $3.5 trillion, the government estimates.

Bath &amp; Body Works’ initiative proved particularly helpful during the pandemic. While competitors struggled with shortages, BBW’s suppliers on location shared raw materials and even employees to make more hand sanitizer and other in-demand goods.

Chief Executive Gina Boswell said locating corporate executives just a short drive away from key manufacturers allows problems to be fixed and new products developed quickly. 

“That’s magical, especially when you need speed and agility,” she said.

The company, which like many retailers benefited from increased consumer spending in the pandemic, said sales could fall this year. 

One challenge to replicating BBW’s model is that factories don’t operate in bubbles, but rely on networks of suppliers, parts and expertise—and moving those networks is costly. Once such a network has been established, it tends to get stuck there. 

Land, labor and compliance with environmental and zoning laws also generally cost more in the U.S. than in China and developing countries.

What works for soap and the two dozen other products BBW makes won’t necessarily translate to smartphones, blenders or even backpacks with highly specialized supply chains deeply rooted in Asia. 

Semiconductor manufacturers and raw steel producers require massive upfront investment and economies of scale. The BBW model is better suited to exploiting economies of scope, in which a manufacturer produces a variety of products. Bath &amp; Body Works can roll out around 7,000 new scented products a year.

BBW, whose headquarters is about 10 miles from the beauty park, was founded by Les Wexner as part of his retail conglomerate, L Brands. The body-products seller grew from 27 stores in 1990 to more than 1,000 in 1999 and 1,810 as of April. In 2021 L Brands spun off its Victoria’s Secret lingerie stores and changed its name to Bath &amp; Body Works, focusing exclusively on that brand. 

For its beauty campus, the company chose New Albany, a planned community close to a major highway and a day’s drive from nearly half the country’s population. 

New Albany wanted to diversify its white-collar economy. To entice BBW, the city created zoning and installed infrastructure at a cost of $6 million to itself and $3 million from the state. The early factories opened on the 450-acre site in 2011.

To make it happen, BBW had to persuade its best suppliers to move. The plus for suppliers was continuing to do business with a fast-growing skin-care seller—with volume guarantees from BBW for a set number of years. The minus: spending millions to relocate production and buy new equipment. 

Rieke Packaging, which makes dispensing pumps for soap bottles, didn’t know if it was going to be worth the investment. At the time, Rieke made the pump at factories in China. Rieke had an existing factory a few hours away in Indiana that could potentially supply the park, but Bath &amp; Body Works said it wanted factories on-site. 

“From a supplier perspective, there was a lot of resistance,” said Craig Miller, who worked for Rieke at the time and now works in supply chain and manufacturing for a pharmaceutical company. “You want us to buy more equipment. Our lease rate is going to be double what it’s going to be in rural Indiana. Come on, that doesn’t sound any fun.” 

Rieke decided to make the several-million dollar investment in New Albany. “It was too big of an opportunity to pass up,” Miller said.  

Moving production to Ohio wasn’t easy. Factories had to contend with planning officials, high labor and construction costs and even endangered bats.

Jeff Stouffer worked for Bath &amp; Body Works in new product launches and later joined a supplier that made perfumes and filled bottles, which opened up a new factory at the campus around 2015. He and other executives met with city and business park officials more than a dozen times to discuss the aesthetics of the relatively small factory, negotiating over everything from the color of the walls to the size of the company’s sign. It was like a homeowners’ association on steroids, he said. 

“They are very rigid about what it looks like,” he said.

The possible presence of a species of endangered bats prevented the removal of trees on the site, delaying construction for several months.

Still, almost every company has expanded beyond their initial investment.

“It’s going to be a 2- to 3-year heavy lift for a payout in 5 to 10 years from now,” Stouffer said. 

Keeping costs down was the biggest challenge. 

Not every production step took place in Ohio at first. Rieke initially molded two outer plastic parts in New Albany, which could be made from any number of colors. It would then attach them to the inner core of the pump, which was still made in China.

Around 2020, Bath &amp; Body Works said it really wanted the entire foaming soap pump to be produced in the U.S. BBW also didn’t want to pay more than the approximately 20 to 25 cents per unit it was paying, according to Will Nguyen, an engineer who then worked for Rieke and now works as a consulting engineer. 

The two sides negotiated a multiyear supplier agreement to bring pump engine production to the campus from China. For a few months, it wasn’t clear if that would happen, said Nguyen. 

Rieke agreed to make the entire pump in Ohio at essentially the same unit cost, and Bath &amp; Body Works helped Rieke get access to volume guarantees and global purchasing and supplier deals with other companies, said Nguyen. 

Now Rieke had to figure out how to make the pumps in Ohio—profitably. They turned to automation. 

In China, building the 13-part pump was a manual process using lots of workers who handled tiny springs and balls. “We cannot replicate the manual process that was done overseas in central Ohio,” said Mark Box, an executive of TriMas Packaging, the parent of Rieke—but getting machines to replicate that work was complicated. “You’ve got very small parts, moving very quickly. The slightest thing can cause a jam.” 

The machines had to make a pump tight enough to keep the liquid inside but not so tight that it won’t operate. The machines also had to deal with differences in plastics and other raw materials from shipment to shipment. 

Nguyen estimates that production in the U.S. employs around 10 people and required $12 million in capital investment, versus employing around 50 people with under $2 million in investment for similar production capacity in China. 

The automation and proximity means that pumps and their parts can arrive and be fully created in under a month, compared with five months previously. Rieke sells around 300 million pumps to Bath &amp; Body Works a year.

New Albany thinks the beauty campus can be a model for other companies and communities. It has attracted an Amgen pharmaceutical plant. Last year Intel chose New Albany as the site of a $20 billion semiconductor facility. The company said the Intel plant would attract dozens of new local suppliers, including semiconductor equipment makers and other materials providers.

The success of the park, and its thousands of employees during the peak season, means that some of the closely located manufacturers are worried about labor shortages. Bath &amp; Body Works has recently allowed some suppliers to open up factories in other parts of Ohio to attract new workers. 

BBW’s strategy today revolves around the unique properties of its beauty park: new products, delivered quickly. Bath &amp; Body Works regularly rolls out fresh aromas and places a premium on fast design and production. This model allows BBW to charge premium prices and avoid discounts and leftovers, and helps cover the added cost of local manufacturing. 

The Wild Sand aroma (fragrance notes: prickly pear fruit, cactus flower and warm agave nectar), launched earlier this month, is available as a hand soap, candle, shower gel, perfume, sanitizer spray, body lotion and self tanner. 

Unlike most retailers, which preorder all of their products for the season months in advance, Bath &amp; Body Works aims to preorder around two-thirds. It then closely monitors sales and places additional “instant” orders for winning products. 

“Within literally a week, that’s what’s getting shipped,” said Nicholas Whitley, chief executive at soap maker and filler KDC/One. 

Being co-located means manufacturers can use a campus shipping service to easily send samples to the next stage in the process or to a Bath &amp; Body Works executive for signoff, no overnight shipping required. How something smells, feels or looks in a store is hard to relay over Zoom calls. 

“There are glitters, holographics that don’t translate as well,” said Tom DeCicco, a graphics manager at label maker CCL Label. “You can’t get that in the picture.”

&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to be a 2- to 3-year heavy lift for a payout in 5 to 10 years from now,” Stouffer said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping costs down was the biggest challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every production step took place in Ohio at first. Rieke initially molded two outer plastic parts in New Albany, which could be made from any number of colors. It would then attach them to the inner core of the pump, which was still made in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 2020, Bath &amp;amp; Body Works said it really wanted the entire foaming soap pump to be produced in the U.S. BBW also didn’t want to pay more than the approximately 20 to 25 cents per unit it was paying, according to Will Nguyen, an engineer who then worked for Rieke and now works as a consulting engineer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two sides negotiated a multiyear supplier agreement to bring pump engine production to the campus from China. For a few months, it wasn’t clear if that would happen, said Nguyen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rieke agreed to make the entire pump in Ohio at essentially the same unit cost, and Bath &amp;amp; Body Works helped Rieke get access to volume guarantees and global purchasing and supplier deals with other companies, said Nguyen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Rieke had to figure out how to make the pumps in Ohio—profitably. They turned to automation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In China, building the 13-part pump was a manual process using lots of workers who handled tiny springs and balls. “We cannot replicate the manual process that was done overseas in central Ohio,” said Mark Box, an executive of TriMas Packaging, the parent of Rieke—but getting machines to replicate that work was complicated. “You’ve got very small parts, moving very quickly. The slightest thing can cause a jam.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The machines had to make a pump tight enough to keep the liquid inside but not so tight that it won’t operate. The machines also had to deal with differences in plastics and other raw materials from shipment to shipment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nguyen estimates that production in the U.S. employs around 10 people and required $12 million in capital investment, versus employing around 50 people with under $2 million in investment for similar production capacity in China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The automation and proximity means that pumps and their parts can arrive and be fully created in under a month, compared with five months previously. Rieke sells around 300 million pumps to Bath &amp;amp; Body Works a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Albany thinks the beauty campus can be a model for other companies and communities. It has attracted an Amgen pharmaceutical plant. Last year Intel chose New Albany as the site of a $20 billion semiconductor facility. The company said the Intel plant would attract dozens of new local suppliers, including semiconductor equipment makers and other materials providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of the park, and its thousands of employees during the peak season, means that some of the closely located manufacturers are worried about labor shortages. Bath &amp;amp; Body Works has recently allowed some suppliers to open up factories in other parts of Ohio to attract new workers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BBW’s strategy today revolves around the unique properties of its beauty park: new products, delivered quickly. Bath &amp;amp; Body Works regularly rolls out fresh aromas and places a premium on fast design and production. This model allows BBW to charge premium prices and avoid discounts and leftovers, and helps cover the added cost of local manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wild Sand aroma (fragrance notes: prickly pear fruit, cactus flower and warm agave nectar), launched earlier this month, is available as a hand soap, candle, shower gel, perfume, sanitizer spray, body lotion and self tanner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most retailers, which preorder all of their products for the season months in advance, Bath &amp;amp; Body Works aims to preorder around two-thirds. It then closely monitors sales and places additional “instant” orders for winning products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Within literally a week, that’s what’s getting shipped,” said Nicholas Whitley, chief executive at soap maker and filler KDC/One. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being co-located means manufacturers can use a campus shipping service to easily send samples to the next stage in the process or to a Bath &amp;amp; Body Works executive for signoff, no overnight shipping required. How something smells, feels or looks in a store is hard to relay over Zoom calls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are glitters, holographics that don’t translate as well,” said Tom DeCicco, a graphics manager at label maker CCL Label. “You can’t get that in the picture.”&lt;/p&gt;

337,stocks,"The Federal Trade Commission is finalizing its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, four people with knowledge of the matter told POLITICO, a move that could ultimately break up parts of the company.

The FTC has been investigating the company on a number of fronts, and the coming case would be one of the most aggressive and high-profile moves in the Biden administration’s rocky effort to tame the power of tech giants. The wide-ranging lawsuit is expected as soon as August, and will likely challenge a host of Amazon’s business practices, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter. If successful, it could lead to a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire and define the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.

Khan rose to prominence as a Big Tech skeptic with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in. Because any case will likely take years to wind through the courts, the final result will rest with her successors.
The exact details of the final lawsuit are not known, and changes to the final complaint are expected until the eleventh hour. But personnel throughout the agency, including Khan herself, have homed in on several of Amazon’s business practices, said some of the people.

The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services, according to some of the people.

The agency has been drafting a complaint since at least the end of last year, some of the people said, and is likely to file its case in federal court rather than its in-house tribunal.

In its probe, the FTC has interviewed dozens of witnesses both inside and outside Amazon, including CEO Andy Jassy and former CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, some of the people said. The FTC has collected millions of documents from Amazon and third parties over the last three years to build its case.

343,stocks,"Microsoft reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Here are the key numbers to follow:

Earnings: $2.69 a share. That may not compare with the $2.55 cents per share expected by Refinitiv.

Revenue:  $56.19 billion. That may not compare with the $55.47 billion expected by Refinitiv.

Based on analysts’ projections, Microsoft will close fiscal 2023 with revenue growth below 10% for the first time since 2017. Growth for the latest quarter is expected to come in at around 7%. Businesses have been delaying cloud and software deployments since last year due to economic uncertainty and the potential for higher interest rates.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in May that the company won’t lift salaries this year.

Analysts polled by CNBC and by StreetAccount expect Microsoft to report about 25% year-over-year growth in revenue from the Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Microsoft doesn’t report Azure revenue in dollars. The projected growth rate is similar to what analysts expect from Google’s cloud division. Parent company Alphabet also reports results after the bell on Tuesday.

During the quarter, Microsoft built on its broad alliance with OpenAI to capitalize on fresh interest in artificial intelligence, following the November launch of the startup’s ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft introduced a chatbot powered partly by OpenAI language models to help workers make sense of their employers’ data, and it told developers they’ll be able to build plugins that people can access through ChatGPT, the Bing search engine’s chatbot, and other tools.

Investors are eager for resolution in Microsoft’s arrangement to buy Activision Blizzard for almost $69 billion, which was agreed upon in January 2022. Earlier this month, an appeals court denied the Federal Trade Commission’s motion to stop the transaction. Activision shares have climbed past $92.50, close to the $95 that Microsoft agreed to pay, reflecting optimism that the deal is on track to close.

Microsoft shares have gained 44% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 19%.

In June, Microsoft said it expected to take a $425 million charge in the quarter to pay a fine from Ireland’s Data Protection Commission after the authority looked at whether the company’s LinkedIn unit violated the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.

Executives will discuss the quarterly results with analysts and issue guidance on a conference call starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

Growth for the latest quarter is expected to come in at around 7%. Businesses have been delaying cloud and software deployments since last year due to economic uncertainty and the potential for higher interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in May that the company won’t lift salaries this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts polled by CNBC and by StreetAccount expect Microsoft to report about 25% year-over-year growth in revenue from the Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Microsoft doesn’t report Azure revenue in dollars. The projected growth rate is similar to what analysts expect from Google’s cloud division. Parent company Alphabet also reports results after the bell on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the quarter, Microsoft built on its broad alliance with OpenAI to capitalize on fresh interest in artificial intelligence, following the November launch of the startup’s ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft introduced a chatbot powered partly by OpenAI language models to help workers make sense of their employers’ data, and it told developers they’ll be able to build plugins that people can access through ChatGPT, the Bing search engine’s chatbot, and other tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are eager for resolution in Microsoft’s arrangement to buy Activision Blizzard for almost $69 billion, which was agreed upon in January 2022. Earlier this month, an appeals court denied the Federal Trade Commission’s motion to stop the transaction. Activision shares have climbed past $92.50, close to the $95 that Microsoft agreed to pay, reflecting optimism that the deal is on track to close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares have gained 44% year to date, while the S&amp;amp;P 500 is up 19%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, Microsoft said it expected to take a $425 million charge in the quarter to pay a fine from Ireland’s Data Protection Commission after the authority looked at whether the company’s LinkedIn unit violated the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executives will discuss the quarterly results with analysts and issue guidance on a conference call starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.&lt;/p&gt;

the things present in almost every major bubble and burst are:

1) bias . ignoring risk.

2) overzealousness . oversizing your position.

3) complacency. e.g markets always go up.

If youre going to go all in in the SPY, make sure you know the real reason - youre betting on the US economy to beat out the rest. thats it.

lastly, the only way you profit is by selling to someone higher. even with dividends, this is from profits which requires inflow of cash from outside the market.

Just dumping my money in these already established companies and believing that they’re going to be even bigger and more importantly still around and operating in profit in 20 years makes my investment strategy feel easy and relaxing. Yet, is it supposed to feel this easy? &lt;/p&gt;

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were little changed Tuesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered its longest winning streak since February 2017.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures inched down by 18 points. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 advanced by 0.1%, and Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.4%.
*****
&gt; The Dow on Monday rose more than 183 points, or 0.5%, marking its 11th consecutive winning session. The 30-stock index also hit its highest level since April 2022 and had its highest close since February 2022. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively.
*****
&gt; While a stronger-than-expected earnings season has helped maintain the market rally, Wall Street is also carefully awaiting the Federal Reserve’s policy decision on Wednesday. Fed fund futures data shows a 98% probability of a quarter-point hike, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Investors are waiting for Chair Jerome Powell’s statements on his outlook for the economy as it tackles inflation.
*****
&gt; “Clearly, the market has a significant amount of momentum. … But we think the fundamental backdrop is still quite negative. Stocks are not bound by any sort of fundamentals,” Eric Johnston, Cantor Fitzgerald’s head of equity derivatives and cross asset, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “We think that the economic risk and the earnings risk [are] one-sided. Meaning that if everything remains okay, then what you see right now – which is sort of subdued, but steady growth — would remain. But we think the risk is really the downside for economic growth,” Johnston added.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Hey there, I wanted to share my thoughts on DHI, a stock I recently invested in. I bought around 100 shares at $117, and today it reached an all-time high of $130. Now, I'm torn between taking profits or holding onto it. I'd love to hear your insights and opinions on this.

Reasons for My Investment:

One of the primary reasons I invested in DHI is the ongoing housing shortage, with about 5 million Americans in need of homes. Despite high-interest rates on mortgages, I believe some millennials are willing to ""get used to"" these rates in order to own a home. Additionally, there's speculation about the Federal Reserve potentially lowering interest rates, though it's been indicated that only one interest rate cut is expected for the entire year (source: The Kobeissi Letter).

Furthermore, DHI's recent Q3 earnings report was impressive, with EPS beating by almost 38% and revenue surpassing estimates by 15.61%. This suggests the company is performing well and could continue to grow.

Concerns to Consider:

While I'm bullish on DHI, there are some concerns to consider. Hedge fund owners have sold off around 2.6 million shares from January to May. While this might not be alarming, it's worth investigating their reasons behind the sell-off.

Average Price Target:

The average price target for DHI is $142, as per the analysts' consensus. While this is positive, we should remember that price targets are speculative and can change based on new information and market conditions.

Your Insights Are Welcome!

Some quick glances at their finances show that they performs well -- well, well enough for its small size and compared against the negative fundamentals of its peers (Lynas, other Australian rare earth producers, and against Canadian rare earth producers) and against other SPACs. For example, it has had a strong growth of its revenue (up 82% in 2020, 147% in 2021, and 58% in 2022), gross profit (up 563% in 2020, 278% in 2021, 69% in 2022), and a decent growth in net profits (down -223% in 2020, up 718% in 2021, and up 114% in 2022); furthermore, EPS has grown from -.27 in 2020 to 1.52 in 2022.

I believe they have a large market-share of US rare earth oxides market as well. Now here are some problems/questions I want to ask you all (more specifically those of you who are either invested in MP or other REO producing companies or track such markets) :

(*BTW I know that MP doesn't produce REO, but rather that they produce the concentrate which they send to Chinese companies to be refined).*

1. How competitive is MP compared to Chinese producers of REO? Does it have a chance against taking a large share from Chinese producers?
2. What are its weaknesses? I know that one of them is the short term volatile price fluctuations of REO. Besides that, do you think the demand and growth projections for REO will be realized or are they severely overestimating them? Adding on to that since REO are commodities, and currently people are saying there is a shortage of them and will continue to be, at current production, a shortage of them in the future, the price of these REOs should increase, but how long until supply meets demand and equilibrium is reached? Because after that MP strategy, since its in the commodity sphere, should just be efficiency in production to reduce costs, right?
3. What do you think about their management? The CEO seems, form the interviews I have watched of him, focused on the idea of establishing a US  REO market, but other views from him regarding the business (except the need for REO, the high demand for them, etc.) I haven't heard much about. What about the other management? -- What do you all think of them?

Finally, I would appreciate any thoughts on MP Materials -- even if you hate them, like them, think they are doomed, etc. etc. I just want to get others opinions and thoughts on this company.

Additionally, retail sales of new energy vehicles increased 10% month over month last month, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), suggesting that Chinese electric vehicle start-ups may be entering the second half of the year with significantly stronger delivery and sales momentum than the first. Due to the growing demand for new energy vehicles as well as the introduction of new products like the ET5 Touring, which diversifies the company's sedan product line, NIO may be poised for ongoing delivery growth.  
With the delivery of 10,707 electric automobiles to its clients in June, NIO performed admirably. The firm delivered more than 10,000 electric vehicles in June for the first time since March, and NIO reached the second-highest monthly delivery total in FY 2023, trailing only February's 12,157 electric car deliveries. NIO experienced growth of 74% month over month, which was also the quickest M/M growth rate the EV manufacturer has witnessed this year.  
The decline in car margins, which presents a profitability issue for both the EV company and the larger sector, is the largest risk for NIO. Because of increased pricing pressure and fiercer market rivalry (as EV companies diversify their product lines to provide customers more options), vehicle margins are declining. If NIO started to experience negative vehicle margins, as XPeng did in the first quarter, that is what would make me rethink my opinion of the firm.  
From an operational perspective, NIO has also recently recorded some very respectable successes: NIO reported its second-highest monthly delivery volume of FY 2023 (only behind February) and regained the significant 10,000 EV delivery threshold in June for the first time since March. Although NIO didn't do as well as Li Auto, which for the first time ever exceeded the threshold of 30,000 EV vehicles, NIO still performed well in June with a 74% M/M rise in deliveries as well as a comeback (15%) in sedan deliveries.

Because of increased pricing pressure and fiercer market rivalry (as EV companies diversify their product lines to provide customers more options), vehicle margins are declining. If NIO started to experience negative vehicle margins, as XPeng did in the first quarter, that is what would make me rethink my opinion of the firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an operational perspective, NIO has also recently recorded some very respectable successes: NIO reported its second-highest monthly delivery volume of FY 2023 (only behind February) and regained the significant 10,000 EV delivery threshold in June for the first time since March. Although NIO didn&amp;#39;t do as well as Li Auto, which for the first time ever exceeded the threshold of 30,000 EV vehicles, NIO still performed well in June with a 74% M/M rise in deliveries as well as a comeback (15%) in sedan deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

371,stocks,"Hi all, happy Monday! I'm seeking to diversify my portfolio and also wanted to break up the SPY, QQQ, NVDA, MSFT chains that always seem to develop here with a company that is less discussed. Ericsson (ticker ERIC) is a communication infrastructure company based in Stockholm currently trading at $5.12 per share at market close. I've been reading up on the company and its expected performance and it seems somewhat positive. 

There are 3 factors that seem to be the primary considerations (this includes my takeaways from the articles, and is not purely fact):

1. Earnings Strength - While the EPS has decreased from $0.73 to an estimated $0.48 over the past year or so, analyst forecasts have been raised after the company beat their expected Q1 earnings by $0.06. 
2. Relative Valuation - The consensus across all the reports I've read are evenly split between a neutral rating on valuation or a positive one. Generally speaking, its current valuation is not quite where it should be, with the general expectation being that it should be valued at $1-$2 higher. 
3. Price Movement - This is one of the strongest indicators that has drawn my attention. The YTD price of the stock has dropped by 32.4%, with a 1-quarter down of 5.1%. The 1-month decline has slowed even more to 3.3%. There is a mix of conclusions here, either the value is bottoming out and will start to climb, or will lead to average price performance over the next few months. 

In my opinion, ERIC seems to be a reasonable, undervalued stock that could prove to be a good short-term holding. What are your thoughts? (I'm still pretty new to investing in general, so constructive feedback on the way I've analyzed this would be greatly appreciated!)

384,stocks,"Some analysis from my site of new and innovative companies, which received massive media attention and hype in the last years. But after hype is gone, many of these stocks has significantly fallen in their prices, especially those that went public in the last two to three years. Nevertheless, in my opinios we have some hidden gems here, which may be worth a look at right now:

**Bumble: A Bumpy Ride for the Dating App Giant**

Bumble, a well-known dating app with additional features, has experienced a significant 77% decline in its stock since its IPO. While its revenue growth has been solid but not outstanding, with a 16% increase in the last quarter, the company's profitability has seen a slight decline but has shown signs of improvement. With a market capitalization of $2.3 billion and a price-to-sales ratio of around 2.5, the current valuation appears attractive, presenting a potential buying opportunity after the initial hype during the IPO was considered unjustified. Investors may find Bumble worth a second look given the current lack of interest in the stock.

**Rivian: The ""Tesla Killer"" Faces Tough Competition**

Rivien, known as the ""Tesla Killer,"" has gathered significant media attention for its electric vehicles, especially pickup trucks and SUVs with unique headlights. Despite the initial hype, the stock has plummeted by 88% since its IPO. Ford and Amazon were major investors, but the relationship with Amazon soured, leading Rivien to terminate its exclusive supply contract.

As a young company, Rivien's latest quarterly numbers show impressive revenue growth of 600%, primarily due to minimal revenue in the previous year. The company is now delivering significant quantities of cars, totaling 8,000 in the current quarter, and aims to achieve a gross profit in 2024 while targeting over 50,000 vehicle deliveries in 2023. With a cash cushion of nearly $12 billion, Rivien's market capitalization stands at $14.2 billion.

Considering the current revenue growth, Rivien's value seems attractive, but it's crucial to acknowledge the uncertainty surrounding its future. The revenue-to-sales ratio is not representative at this stage. Investors who believe in Rivien as a serious automaker may find the company's valuation worthy of respect. However, the stock remains speculative due to ongoing uncertainties and market speculation.

**Didi: The Struggles of a Ride-Hailing Giant in China**

Didi, a ride-hailing company with food delivery services, has experienced an 80% decline in stock value since its IPO. Revenue growth has been inconsistent due to COVID-19 impact and regulatory challenges in China. Despite a recent data scandal and a $1.2 billion fine, Didi's market capitalization is $14.5 billion, less than one times its revenue of $19 billion. A potential China comeback may make the stock appealing, but it carries increased risk.

**Marqeta: A Hidden Gem in the Fintech Industry**

Marqeta, a fintech company serving the B2B sector with payment and card solutions, has seen an 84% decline in stock value since its IPO. Revenue growth has been impressive, with a 31% increase in the last quarter, leading to improved profitability. Currently, Marqeta's market capitalization stands at $2.6 billion, with revenue reaching $800 million, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of approximately 3.3. Considering the strong 30% growth, the current valuation appears exciting and remarkably inexpensive. However, the stock was evidently overvalued at its IPO, given its current financial performance.

**Palantir: The Profitability Puzzle**

Palantir, a well-known data analysis software firm, has seen a 66% increase in its stock since IPO, achieving near profitability in the last two quarters. While revenue growth was solid at 18%, the market capitalization stands at $33 billion, 17 times its revenue of $2 billion. This valuation is deemed very high, considering moderate profitability and an 18% growth rate.

**Coupang: The South Korean Amazon**

Coupang, a dominant player in South Korea's 24-hour delivery and e-commerce market, has seen a 60% decline in stock value since IPO. Despite stable growth and a 20% currency-adjusted growth rate in the latest quarter, profitability has surged by 36%, with a positive EBITDA of $241 million. With a market capitalization of $31 billion and revenue of $21 billion, the stock's current valuation is just 1.5 times its revenue, making it an attractive deal. Considering a potential strong comeback in South Korea, the stock deserves a second look.

**Snowflake: A Hyped Cloud-Based Software Service**

Snowflake, a cloud-based software service company, is shaping the market and expects exponential growth. Despite a 25% decline since IPO, its latest quarterly numbers were strong, with a 47% revenue increase and positive earnings per share. The net revenue retention remains high at 151%, but a downward trend is evident. With a market capitalization of $55 billion and revenue of $2.2 billion, the stock's current valuation is 25 times its revenue, considered astronomically high. The hype surrounding Snowflake's partnerships with Microsoft and Nvidia attracts investors, but caution is advised as market interest may eventually calm down.

**Coinbase: Riding the Cr\*ptocurrency Rollercoaster**

Coinbase, a cryptocurrency platform, experienced a significant decline since its IPO, currently standing at -76% from the offering price. The decreasing interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, has impacted Coinbase's trading volume and revenue, which almost halved since the beginning of 2022. Despite managing to improve profitability, Coinbase still operates at a negative margin. The current market capitalization is $17 billion with revenue of $2.8 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of over 6, which isn't considered cheap. As the market largely depends on the price of B\*tcoin and cr\*pto trading volume, Coinbase is viewed as a speculative investment, and direct investment in Bitcoin might yield better results, especially during downward phases.

**GitLab: A Promising Business Model**

GitLab, a DevOps platform solution, has experienced a decline of 56% since its IPO. Despite this, the company's business development has been promising, with pleasing revenue and profitability trends. GitLab follows a software-as-a-service subscription model, charging per user per month. The current market capitalization is $7 billion with revenue of $460 million, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of approximately 15. While the numbers are good, the high valuation may not be fully justified yet. However, the positive business trajectory indicates potential for further stock growth.

**DoorDash: Strong Growth with Uncertain Profitability**

DoorDash, a food delivery service, has experienced a decline of 56% since its IPO. Despite this, the company has shown strong revenue growth, averaging around 40% in recent quarters, and provided a slight surprise in earnings per share. The current market capitalization is $29 billion with revenue of $7.1 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 4. However, DoorDash is yet to achieve profitability, and the path to break-even remains unclear. Although restaurant food prices have increased by around 25%, DoorDash still faces challenges in reaching profitability. As such, investors may be cautious until a clear path to profitability emerges.

**Roblox: Targeting a Young Audience**

Roblox, an online game platform targeting a young audience, has seen a 42% decline in its stock since its IPO. Revenue growth has been stagnant, influenced by pandemic effects, and losses have significantly widened, reaching approximately $270 million per quarter. Despite this, Roblox has a high market valuation of $23 billion with revenue of $2.3 billion, resulting in a stock price ten times higher than its revenue. This valuation is considered expensive, especially considering the increased losses and minimal growth, as the company relies on the purchasing power of parents of its young target audience. As a result, investors may view Roblox as a risky investment at its current valuation.

**UiPath: Robotics in Process Automation**

UiPath, a company specializing in robotic process automation (RPA), has seen a significant decline of nearly 74% in its stock since its IPO. However, its revenue has almost doubled since going public, and the retention rate remains high at 22%. The latest quarterly numbers were positive, with growth and earnings per share surpassing expectations. Currently, UiPath's market capitalization is just under $10 billion with revenue of $1.1 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 8.6, which is not considered cheap. UiPath faces competition from other players like Microsoft in the RPA and process automation space, which adds to the competitive landscape. While the company's financial performance shows promise, investors may be cautious about its valuation and the competitive challenges it faces.

**Toast: A Savory Deal for Restaurant Operators**

Toast, a specialized software solution for the restaurant sector, has experienced a decline of -60% in its stock value since its IPO. However, the company's financials show positive signs. It has achieved steady growth with a robust 53% revenue increase in the first quarter of 2023. The revenue sources include hardware sales, subscription model fees, and other channels for restaurant operators. Toast's profitability has also improved significantly, with the negative adjusted EBITDA nearly halving in recent quarters. Currently, the stock has a market capitalization of $11 billion with revenue of $3 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 4, which is considered an attractive valuation given the current growth rate. The company's ingenious business model that covers various aspects of the restaurant business makes it promising for potential investors despite its recent stock decline.

**Affirm: Stagnation in the ""Buy Now, Pay Later"" Space**

Affirm, a fintech company providing ""buy now, pay later"" solutions to online retailers, has experienced a 57% decline in its stock value since its mid-2021 IPO. The company's revenue has remained relatively stagnant in recent quarters, with no significant growth. Similar trends are observed with competitors like Mollie, Afterpay, and Zip, indicating a stagnant market. Due to the lack of growth and increasing profits, the current valuation is deemed too expensive, and the stock does not present many investment opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

In conclusion, this analysis highlights the rollercoaster ride of IPO hype, with some stocks failing to fullfill the expectations, while others offer hidden gems potential. For me personaly: Toast and Coupang stand out as promising stocks with strong financials. Let me know your thoughts on this summary and your personal ""hidden gems"".

However, its revenue has almost doubled since going public, and the retention rate remains high at 22%. The latest quarterly numbers were positive, with growth and earnings per share surpassing expectations. Currently, UiPath&amp;#39;s market capitalization is just under $10 billion with revenue of $1.1 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 8.6, which is not considered cheap. UiPath faces competition from other players like Microsoft in the RPA and process automation space, which adds to the competitive landscape. While the company&amp;#39;s financial performance shows promise, investors may be cautious about its valuation and the competitive challenges it faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toast: A Savory Deal for Restaurant Operators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toast, a specialized software solution for the restaurant sector, has experienced a decline of -60% in its stock value since its IPO. However, the company&amp;#39;s financials show positive signs. It has achieved steady growth with a robust 53% revenue increase in the first quarter of 2023. The revenue sources include hardware sales, subscription model fees, and other channels for restaurant operators. Toast&amp;#39;s profitability has also improved significantly, with the negative adjusted EBITDA nearly halving in recent quarters. Currently, the stock has a market capitalization of $11 billion with revenue of $3 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 4, which is considered an attractive valuation given the current growth rate. The company&amp;#39;s ingenious business model that covers various aspects of the restaurant business makes it promising for potential investors despite its recent stock decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affirm: Stagnation in the &amp;quot;Buy Now, Pay Later&amp;quot; Space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affirm, a fintech company providing &amp;quot;buy now, pay later&amp;quot; solutions to online retailers, has experienced a 57% decline in its stock value since its mid-2021 IPO. The company&amp;#39;s revenue has remained relatively stagnant in recent quarters, with no significant growth. Similar trends are observed with competitors like Mollie, Afterpay, and Zip, indicating a stagnant market. Due to the lack of growth and increasing profits, the current valuation is deemed too expensive, and the stock does not present many investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this analysis highlights the rollercoaster ride of IPO hype, with some stocks failing to fullfill the expectations, while others offer hidden gems potential. For me personaly: Toast and Coupang stand out as promising stocks with strong financials. Let me know your thoughts on this summary and your personal &amp;quot;hidden gems&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

391,stocks,"I looked into Carvana, again, and I am surprised by the way the management is communicating key information.

**Disclaimer: I have no exposure to Carvana, and never had.**

The post will be divided into the following segments:

* Misleading investors
* Painting a rosy picture with window dressing
* The trouble ahead

&amp;#x200B;

**Misleading investors**

As Carvana is an eCommerce platform for buying/selling used cars, the revenue, as well as, the gross profit per unit are both important to keep track of.

The company has 3 different revenue sources:

* Retail Sales
* Wholesale Sales
* Other (Sales of financing loans and commissions)

I'd like to point to the Gross profit per unit (**""GPU""**). It doesn't take a high level of education to calculate this, right?

Here are the numbers from the last quarter:

* Gross profit: $499 million
* Retail vehicle unit sales: 76,530
* Wholesale vehicle unit sales: 46,453

If you did the math correctly, you'd get slightly above $4k gross profit per unit.

Carvana reports **a GPU of $6,520.** You might wonder how? Where does it go wrong? Well, the explanation is simple. They divide the total gross profit with **only the retail vehicle unit sales**.

This makes absolutely no sense! Not only that, it is being communicated everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

**Painting a rosy picture with window dressing**

It is not uncommon for companies to use accounting tricks to show somewhat better results. I'd like to point to Carvana's free cash flow for the first half of 2023. Based on the cash flow statement,

Cash from operations **$443 million**

Capex: **$50 million**

Free cash flow **$393 million**

This is not bad for a company that is not profitable, so one might wonder how can this be the case.

No, the explanation does not lie in share-based compensation.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take a look at a simple example - **A lemonade stand**:

Imagine you own a lemonade stand and on the 31st of December 2022, you’ve spent $1,000 to buy all the raw materials needed (lemons, sugar, etc.)Then, in the new year, you’ve sold all of this for $950. Yes, you lost money as the business is not profitable. However, during 2023, you brought in $950 in cash from operations!

Now you have a lemonade stand with no inventories, as you did not buy more lemons and sugar. This is clearly not sustainable. If you did restock and spent $1,000 again, the cash from operations would have been -$50 (matching the profitability of the business).

&amp;#x200B;

Let's go back to Carvana. During these 6 months, Carvana reduced its inventory by $564 million. So, the company now holds less inventory than it had before.  All companies of this kind, need to restock. Therefore, if Carvana restocked, the free cash flow would have been negative $171 million.I think credit should be given for reducing inventory, but the $393 million of reported free cash flow should not be used as a guide for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**The trouble ahead**

The most common method of buying a car is using a car loan (based on Statista, 84% of the cars in the US are financed). That means the total cost of the car is the sum of:

* The purchase price of the car, and;
* The interest on a car loan

&amp;#x200B;

With rising interest rates, there are two scenarios that could happen:

Scenario 1: The prices of the cars remain the same, leading to higher total costs, which will lead to lower demand

Scenario 2: The prices of the cars will drop due to the lower demand, which will lead to similar total costs. From an economic point of view, it is likely to experience scenario 1, followed by scenario 2.

In both scenarios, Carvana is exposed to a tough environment.

The company is still unprofitable, it has $8.5 billion in debt (including leases), and roughly $0.5 billion in cash. In my opinion, regardless of the refinancing, the company is headed for bankruptcy. Could I be wrong? Of course.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked into Carvana, again, and I am surprised by the way the management is communicating key information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The trouble ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common method of buying a car is using a car loan (based on Statista, 84% of the cars in the US are financed). That means the total cost of the car is the sum of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The purchase price of the car, and;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interest on a car loan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With rising interest rates, there are two scenarios that could happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario 1: The prices of the cars remain the same, leading to higher total costs, which will lead to lower demand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario 2: The prices of the cars will drop due to the lower demand, which will lead to similar total costs. From an economic point of view, it is likely to experience scenario 1, followed by scenario 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both scenarios, Carvana is exposed to a tough environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is still unprofitable, it has $8.5 billion in debt (including leases), and roughly $0.5 billion in cash. In my opinion, regardless of the refinancing, the company is headed for bankruptcy. Could I be wrong? Of course.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the weekend, moviegoers turned out in force for Greta Gerwig’s neon-coated fantasy comedy “Barbie,” which smashed expectations with $155 million to land the biggest debut of the year. But they also showed up to see Christopher Nolan’s R-rated historical drama “Oppenheimer,” which collected a remarkable $80.5 million in its opening weekend.

The company was a spin off in 2014. They also have a bout a 5% insider ownership rate, which is impressive. They credit a lot of this to their employee stock purchase plan which helps employees build equity in the company. Basically, they want employees to benefit from the company doing well, as this creates more incentive for the employees to perform at a high level.

CSWI pays a small dividend (0.44%) which it started in 2019 and has increased every year except 2020. It tries to allocate capital in 2 ways to grow the company. First, is to develop new products. CSW has a long history of quality and works with its customers to develop products they need. They also grow through acquisition.

398,stocks,"Tesla Inc. has started offering consumers 84-month auto loans after Elon Musk said the carmaker would “have to do something” about rising interest rates. The company now includes seven-year loans as an option on its US order pages, after previously offering loans as long as 72 months. While extending loan terms can lower car buyers’ monthly payments, consumers tend to pay more in interest and face greater risk of owing more than their vehicle is worth.

Tesla’s chief executive officer has been a frequent critic of the Federal Reserve. Musk tweeted in November that the central bank’s rate increases were “massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.” His predictions of impending deflation haven’t yet panned out.“When interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car, because the interest payments increase the price of the car,” Musk said during Tesla’s July 19 earnings call. “So we have to do something about that.”

While 84-month auto loans have been gaining in popularity, the trend slowed early this year, according to credit-reporting company Experian. Roughly 34% of new vehicles loans in the first quarter were longer than six years, down from about 38% a year ago. Tesla delivered a record 466,140 vehicles during the three months that ended in June but has sold fewer cars than it’s produced each of the last five quarters. The shares plunged after Musk said on this week’s call that the company will have to keep lowering prices if interest rates continue to rise.

402,stocks,"This is more of a question post than my own due diligence.

Companies like Carvana and Transocean have provided monster returns for investors willing to buy in the “dead period” when nobody cares/company looks like it will go bankrupt. I do think LUMN is 1) trying to bottom and 2) very volatile but a long term chart zoomed out is starting to look kinda flat even with huge up and down days

In my view, LUMN is saddled with such extreme debt that it could be a deep value play IF they are able to hold on and not go bankrupt. Maybe they can go 5-10x like Carvana or RIG.

From what I gather, management seems to have a long term plan that includes asset sales to pay off big chunks of debt, buying back shares (idk if that is a good idea if they are distressed: see Bed Bath and Beyond), later investing a big chunk of capex in a couple years to expand the business, and hopefully roll over the debt. 

So IMO this is a rates play but I haven’t done enough homework. Bonds seem priced for bankruptcy and maybe that is an awesome way to play the recovery but I bought a handful of shares since it recovered post lead cable FUD (possible capitulation event) with a massive green day and added a few otm call options as far out as I could. I think this isn’t something I would bet big on but it could be a stock where you turn nothing (a very small amount of your money, like .1-.3% of your portfolio) into something (2-3%) if it works out. And sometimes things can work out quite fast. I remember reading about RIG on WSB at the bottom when it was $.80/share and I thought about buying LEAPs and seeing what happened. I didn’t bc too many people said they were going bankrupt and there was too much dilution. Little did I know that in distressed asset investing, it DOES NOT matter if you get diluted to hell. Risk of going to zero trumps that by a lot. If LUMN can also buy back shares along the way, that would be even more impressive, but seems risky to throw away money at reducing the float if you go bankrupt. Additionally, if they sell a bunch of assets, wouldn’t that potentially massively decrease cash flow?

Any thoughts on LUMN timeframes, execution risk, and expectations if it works out? How long would this take for the market to not believe they are going bankrupt?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is more of a question post than my own due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I gather, management seems to have a long term plan that includes asset sales to pay off big chunks of debt, buying back shares (idk if that is a good idea if they are distressed: see Bed Bath and Beyond), later investing a big chunk of capex in a couple years to expand the business, and hopefully roll over the debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So IMO this is a rates play but I haven’t done enough homework. Bonds seem priced for bankruptcy and maybe that is an awesome way to play the recovery but I bought a handful of shares since it recovered post lead cable FUD (possible capitulation event) with a massive green day and added a few otm call options as far out as I could. I think this isn’t something I would bet big on but it could be a stock where you turn nothing (a very small amount of your money, like .1-.3% of your portfolio) into something (2-3%) if it works out. And sometimes things can work out quite fast. I remember reading about RIG on WSB at the bottom when it was $.80/share and I thought about buying LEAPs and seeing what happened. I didn’t bc too many people said they were going bankrupt and there was too much dilution. Little did I know that in distressed asset investing, it DOES NOT matter if you get diluted to hell. Risk of going to zero trumps that by a lot. If LUMN can also buy back shares along the way, that would be even more impressive, but seems risky to throw away money at reducing the float if you go bankrupt. Additionally, if they sell a bunch of assets, wouldn’t that potentially massively decrease cash flow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts on LUMN timeframes, execution risk, and expectations if it works out? How long would this take for the market to not believe they are going bankrupt?&lt;/p&gt;

403,stocks,"Hi guys,   


Im learning a little bit about how the stock market works in a exchange, and i understood the following:  


At the beginning of the day there is an auction at the exchange(before the market starts), people can give their bids and asks, and there is an algorithm at the exchange system to match this, in order to maximize the number of trades. It defines the opening price of the asset, and after that the market operates normally(bids, asks and trades), and at the end of the day there is another auction to define the close price(at the same way as at the morning).  
Now saying about corporate actions, i've always used corporate actions to correct prices in the past, but how it works when a corporate action is paid, in the exchange level? in a split for example, the exchange that correct the prices at the auction? or the people their bids and asks at the auction? How does it works for someone (in a brokerage) that sent a order in a day before the split?(the brokerage will correct its offer?, the offer is cancelled?  


Thanks in advance!

&lt;p&gt;NAND - Intel had NAND fabs in china that weren&amp;#39;t even being close to profitable and sold to SK Hynix after wasting billions down the drain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optane - Micron Technology  shut down Joint Venture 3DXPOINT leaving intel without their silicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altera -Intel purchased Altera the #2 fpga player for $17 billion  vastly over paying and seeing no ROI. Intel no longer breaks their fpga business out in their earnings presentations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4G/5G Modem - complete failure business abandoned &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barefoot Networks - complete failure business abandoned&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gross Margins - INTC 38.4$ AMD 53% AVGO 73%  NVDA 67%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talent/Stock - If an engineer at intel got 200k in rsus after 4 years they would be worth $183,784. At nvidia 200k in rsus would be worth $2.1 million. Why would anyone want to work at intel? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capex: heavy cap ex requirements will keep pressure on margins&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition: Intel faces stiff completion from AMD and NVIDIA when it comes to CPU applications. They are also missing out as the large datacenter customers develop their own custom silicon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GPU - shit show at first when intel rolled out their cards. So many bugs and just terrible performance but looks like driver issues are being addressed an they are already past AMD and closing in on NVIDIA when it comes to their up sampling technology. I&amp;#39;m not very bullish on their GPUs because they had over a decade of experience for iGPU. It remains to be seen if intel GPPU/XPU products will be adopted by the large data center customers. Gamers are a much smaller slice of teh GPU supply now.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile Eye: Probably intel&amp;#39;s best decision in their 20 years as a company but they are so desperate for cash they are going to spin them off in an ipo&lt;/p&gt;

417,stocks,"With regionals and banks declaring earnings this week I think they're looking pretty good. What happened in March with SVB and whatnot, in my opinion, is looking more and more like mania coupled with a some idiosyncratic band management practices at a couple banks mainly SVB. Curious if anybody has any plays or insight they want to share.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking pretty heavily at Western Alliance Preferred Shares (WAL.PRA). WAL was beat when rumors came out that it along with PACW were looking for significant asset shares that caused those two stocks to drop significantly. WAL came out and denied it and it appears it may have been a short run attempt, but either way WAL stock price still not all the way back. 

WAL declared earnings this week and they're looking pretty good. Not only did they gain $3 billion dollars in deposits this quarter, going from about $47 billion to $50 billlion, but they've also indicated thye've had an additional $2 billion increase in deposits to date which would bring them up to $52 billion or so and, importantly, **above where they were last year in deposits.** Meaning not only was the flow-out not that bad, but they're actually starting to grow deposits above where they were before all the bank-runs happened this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, for real estate exposure, they have about $9 billion in CRE loans relative to about $50 billion in loans total, and only $2.3 billion of the CRE is in specifically office space and only 3% of that is in central business districts. They've focused more on suburban office space. Additionally, they're median Loan-To-Value ratio  is about 58% meaning that if they building they gave CRE loans on dropped 40% in value, the bank's equity would still be protected and the bank would not take a hit (this is building specific but on a median overall level this should be true). Thus, their is significant downside protection before the bank's equity starts having to take a hit on the CRE they provided loans on. Accordingly, overall, it looks like they're pretty protected and outside or an apocalyptic type event - as oppose to CRE taking a 30% to 40% hit - WAL should be alright. 

&amp;#x200B;

Their net interest income is also positive at about 3.4% and they expect it to start going up now with rates stabilizing and whatnot.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, overall I think WAL is looking pretty attractive. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I think is an interesting play though is there preferred stock. It's a fixed rate, value of $25 that when issued in 2021 was set at 4.25% payment. But, it resets every 5 years to the 5 year treasury rate plus 3.45%. The first reset date is 2026. Because treasury rates are high - meaning the 4.25% current payout has to normalize to current treasury rates plus a risk premium for the preferred not being a treasury - the preferred stock is currently trading at about $15.70 a share, an about 7% yield.

&amp;#x200B;

But, when the rate resets in 2026 to market rate/the stock derisks as more time goes on assuming there isn't a 2008 type fallout, then the base price should trend back up to $25 a share. And, if you buy now while it's a $15.70 and the rate resets in 2026 to likely a 6.5% yield or higher (if treasuries are 4% then the rate would reset to 7.45%), not only will the preffered stock value apprecaite back up to $25 a share but you would then be getting likely a 10% to 12% yearly dividend yield on what you bought it for. 

&amp;#x200B;

Curious people's thoughts on this, or other play's they are looking at.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary: WAL.PRA currently trading at $15.70 with a 7% yield. The stock should appreciate to $25 by 2026 if everything goes smoothly and the yield rate will reset in 2026 to likely a 6.5% yield or higher. Thus, buying now you could be looking at getting a 7% yield while you wait for a 66% capital appreciation in the stock from $15.70 to $25 over the next couple of years; and, at that point, not only would you have 66% capital appreciation but when the rate resets you would likely be getting a 10% to 12% yearly dividend yield on what you invest.

418,stocks,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 24th, 2023.

# **Dow ekes out narrow gain Friday for 10th straight positive day, longest rally since 2017: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks were mixed Friday as traders assessed the latest corporate earnings results, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average stretched its winning streak to 10 sessions.
*****
&gt; The 30-stock Dow climbed 2.51 points, or 0.01%, to close at 35,227.69. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.03% to end at 4,536.34, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.22% to finish the session at 14,032.81.
*****
&gt; The Dow narrowly notched its tenth straight day of gains, a feat not seen for the index since August 2017.
*****
&gt; On a weekly basis, the S&amp;P 500 added 0.69%, while the Dow gained 2.08%. It was the second positive week in a row for the two indexes. The Nasdaq fell 0.57% for the period.
*****
&gt; Trading was volatile Friday as portfolio managers recalibrated their funds to account for an unusual Nasdaq-100 rebalance taking effect Monday. A large volume of index and stock options also expired Friday.
*****
&gt; Traders were still eyeing more corporate earnings after a busy week of quarterly results. Transportation giant CSX fell 3.7% on the back of underwhelming results. American Express, meanwhile, dropped nearly 3.9%.
*****
&gt; Corporate earnings have been mixed thus far. Seventy-five percent of S&amp;P 500 companies that have already reported have exceeded analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet data. However, that beat rate is below a three-year average of 80%, according to The Earnings Scout.
*****
&gt; ″...Overall, early Q2 results appear good enough for equity markets to grind higher for now,” Barclays analyst Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Friday note. “Next week will be more indicative of the broad earnings dynamics, with ~50% of market cap reporting.”

&gt; # It’s a Bird. It’s A Plane! It’s … the US Economy!

&gt; We just got a bunch of data to round out the economic picture in the second quarter (Q2).

&gt; Long story short: Not only do we see no sign of recession, but it also doesn’t even look like the economy is looking for a “landing” at this point.

&gt; I realize this could change, but so far the data doesn’t indicate much weakness. Now, the monthly data can be volatile, and subject to revisions. So it helps to look at the last three months. Let’s walk through some of the highlights.

&gt; # Consumption Was Strong

&gt; * Retail sales rose at a 4.7% annual pace in Q2.

&gt; * Core retail sales, excluding categories like vehicle and gas station sales, rose at a 6.3% annual pace.

&gt; * Even after adjusting for inflation, “real” retail sales rose at a 1.9% annual pace in Q2, and are currently running 6% above the pre-crisis trend!

&gt; # The Supply Side Is Coming Back

&gt; * Vehicle production rose 7.6% in Q2.

&gt; * Production within the aerospace industry rose 4.7% in Q2.

&gt; * High-tech industries are running hot, with production up 3.9%, and almost 17% above pre-pandemic levels.

&gt; * Production of business equipment outside of vehicles and high-tech also looks to have bottomed, which is a positive sign for capex.

&gt; # Construction is Booming

&gt; * Single-family housing permits and starts rose 11% in Q2.

&gt; * An index measuring homebuilder sentiment continues to move higher, indicating that builders are getting more positive about future demand.

&gt; * Meanwhile, total housing units under construction (single-family and multi-family) are near an all-time record.

&gt; * Combine that with a boom in manufacturing construction, and its not a surprise why construction payrolls have increased by 88,000 this year and are about 339,000 above pre-pandemic levels.

&gt; # All These Points to Strong Economic Growth

&gt; The Atlanta Fed puts out a “nowcast” of quarterly real GDP growth that is updated with major economic data releases. Right now, it says the economy grew 2.4% in Q2, after adjusting for inflation.

&gt; If that is close to actual GDP growth in Q2, it would mean the economy grew 2.6% over the past year. That is not only stronger than the average 2.3% pace of growth between 2010 and 2019, but it also matches the pace of growth over the three years prior to the pandemic (2017-2019), when economic growth picked up.

&gt; What is amazing is that the economy accelerated after a poor first half of 2022 even as the Federal Reserve hiked rates aggressively, taking the federal funds rate from 0.25% to 5.25%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-20-real-gdp-growth-projected-1206x1600.png))**

&gt; Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.6% over the past year, and headline inflation fell from 9% to 3%.

&gt; It really doesn’t get better than that. Perhaps more importantly, there is no reason to believe a major slowdown is in the cards at this point.

&gt; # Seasonal Bump Absent in Claims Data

&gt; Among the many economic indicators updated this morning, seasonally adjusted initial jobless claims came in stronger than expected, falling to 228K. That reversed the recent jump in claims observed throughout the late spring.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072023-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; Looking at the non-seasonally adjusted data helps to explain the recent decline in the adjusted number. As shown below, barring the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, claims remain at one of the higher readings for the current week of the year in recent history. Typically, in late June and early July, seasonal headwinds cause a significant bump in claims. This year, that increase has been relatively modest.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072023-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Pivoting to continuing claims, the indicator had been on the decline since early April, but the first two weeks of July have seen a modest turn higher. At those levels, continuing claims remain in the middle of the range from the few years leading up to the pandemic.

&gt; # Bulls Dominate

&gt; The past week has provided some positive developments on the inflation front that in turn sent equities higher. In response, readings on investor sentiment have shown a dramatic positive turn. The latest AAII survey showed more than half of respondents reported as bullish for the first time since April 22, 2021. As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, this week's reading ended an over two-year-long streak without a reading above 50% which was the third longest such streak on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072023-AAII-Bullish-sentiment.png))**

&gt; Given the elevated reading of bullish sentiment, a minor share of respondents are reporting as bearish. In fact, that reading fell to 21.5% this week which is the lowest reading since June 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072023-AAII-Bearishsentiment.png))**

&gt; Last year saw a record streak of weeks where bearish sentiment outnumbered bullish sentiment. With the total reversal in sentiment, the bull-bear spread now heavily favors bulls. The spread reached 29.9% this week for the highest reading since April 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072023-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; The gains to bullish sentiment have not entirely come from bears. Neutral sentiment is also reaching new lows, registering just 27.1% this week. Unlike bearish sentiment, that is only the lowest level since the last week of 2022.

&gt; In tonight's Closer we will discuss the surge in other sentiment indicators and what that has historically meant for S&amp;P 500 performance.

&gt; # DJIA Advances for 8th Straight Day – Historically Bullish for Next 3 Months

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/646ff2a11a4a705724163ead66ed70d6/2fe5ab035e3861fd-b4/s500x750/2cf29a7ed0b4a7661967f45524f61e07137e7ab8.jpg))**

&gt; For the 54th time since 1950, DJIA has recorded a daily winning streak of at least eight days. This is DJIA’s first 8-day winning streak since 2019. During the current streak DJIA has advanced 3.93%. Of the prior 53 daily winning streaks lasting eight or more trading days, 26 ended at 8 days, 14 ended at 9 days, 8 made it to 10 days, while 2 made it to 11 and 12 days. DJIA’s longest daily winning streak of 13 days was in January 1987. DJIA also enjoyed an 8-day winning streak in July 1987. Based upon the last 53 streaks, there is only a modest 50.9% chance of the current streak continuing to 9 days or longer.

&gt; Historically, daily winning streaks of 8-trading days or more have been bullish even after they ended. Over the 1-, 2-week, 1-, and 3-month periods after the daily winning streak ended DJIA was higher, 98.1%, 98.1%, 96.2% and 90.6% respectively. The only significant decline within 3 months of a daily streak end was a 19.22% loss in 1987.

&gt; # Reality Check for Housing Starts

&gt; After a blockbuster report for May where Housing Starts and Building Permits both surged, there was a bit of a reality check in June. While Building Permits were expected to come in at 1.50 million, the actual reading came in at 1.44 million representing a 3.7% m/m decline and a drop of 15.3% y/y. One positive of this report, though, was that single-family units actually increased 2.2% and are only down 2.7% y/y even as multi-family units plunged 12.8% m/m and over 30% y/y. With respect to Housing Starts, the headline reading also missed estimates by 46K (1.434 mln vs 1.480 mln). Not only did June's reading miss forecasts, but May's reading was revised lower, so that the originally reported 231K beat was more like 159K. Even after that downward revision, though, Housing Starts declined 8.0% m/m and 8.1% y/y.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071923-Table.png))**

&gt; Following May's report, we noted that the 12-month moving average of Housing Starts had broken its streak of 12 straight declines, but this month, the moving average resumed its downtrend and fell to its lowest level since February 2021. Similarly, the 12-month moving average for Building Permits declined below 1.49 million for the first time since December 2020 and posted its 11th straight decline.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071923-12-Month-average-Shorter-term.png))**

&gt; Taking a longer-term look at the 12-month moving average for Housing Starts, it remains in its well-established downtrend. As shown in the chart below, prior periods where this average peaked and started to rollover usually preceded recessions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071923-12-Month-average.png))**

&gt; A comparison of Housing Starts versus the performance of homebuilder stocks is a perfect example of how the market tends to trade in advance of events. Just as homebuilder stocks peaked four months ahead of the peak in Housing Starts, they bottomed five months in advance of the recent low in the three-month moving average.

&gt; # Homebuilders Hopeful

&gt; Housing activity has been somewhat muted given a dearth of inventories, but the lack of available existing supply has been positive for homebuilders. The NAHB's monthly survey of homebuilder sentiment moved higher in July for its seventh straight monthly gain. Even after the rebound, the current level of 56 represents just a 13-month high and is below the range of readings from the few years prior to the pandemic and historic readings in two years before the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071823-NAHB-1.png))**

&gt; The improvement in the headline index was primarily driven by increases in present sales and traffic. Geographically, the Midwest and South saw some modest softening in sentiment whereas the West and Northeast were much more impressive. The Northeast in particular saw an 8-point jump which ranks in the top decile of all monthly moves on record and brings the index into the top quartile of historical readings.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071823-NAHB-2.png))**

&gt; Although homebuilder sentiment has been rebounding solidly, it pales in comparison to the strength of homebuilder stocks. Proxied by the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB), homebuilders have continued to set new 52-week highs on a near-daily basis. The ETF has now risen 56% over the past year and has continuously traded in overbought territory (currently extremely overbought with a price more than 2 standard deviations above its 50-DMA).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071823-NAHB-3.png))**

&gt; Homebuilder earnings are also on deck in the next couple of weeks. Below, we show a screenshot from the Earnings Explorer function of our Custom Portfolios. As shown, all but three S&amp;P 1500 Homebuilders are due to report through the first week of August. Of those, a vast majority have averaged positive moves on earnings.

&gt; # The Dollar is Weakening – Why That’s Good for US Investors

&gt; At the beginning of the year, we wrote in our 2023 Outlook that the US dollar was poised to weaken, creating tailwinds for Americans who invest in International stocks and S&amp;P 500 earnings. We reiterated that this is starting to happen in our Mid-Year Outlook, “Edging Closer to Normal.”

&gt; The chart below shows the recent swing in the ICE US Dollar Index, which measures changes in the US dollar against a basket of other currencies, including the euro, yen, British pound, and the Canadian dollar. It rose 27% between May ’21 and September ’22, but has pulled back 12% since then.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-US-dollar-index-600x800.png))**

&gt; # A Boost for USD-Based International Equity Investors

&gt; When an investor in the US uses dollars to buy a basket of international stocks, the interim step is first converting those dollars to the local currency, which introduces currency risk. Note that when you see quotes for international stock exchanges, like the Nikkei (Japan) or the DAX (Germany), those are in local currency terms. To buy European stocks, you must first convert dollars to euros. Your returns are not just dependent on what the European stocks do; it’s also dependent on what happens to the euro relative to the dollar. If the euro appreciates against the dollar, that’s a tailwind to your investment, whereas a stronger dollar acts as a headwind.

&gt; From September 30th of last year through July 14th, the MSCI EAFE Index, which represents a basket of international stocks across developed markets, outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index. The MSCI EAFE Index gained 35.2% versus 27.4% for the S&amp;P 500. But as you can see from the table below, that outperformance is because of a tailwind from a weaker dollar. Emerging market stocks have also seen a tailwind from a weaker dollar but have underperformed due to a murky economic picture in China.

&gt; Even over the past month and half (May 31st through July 14th), the dollar took a renewed plunge, boosting returns for international stocks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-USD-and-local-currency-returns-for-indices.png))**

&gt; # A Tailwind for Earnings

&gt; Over the last two decades, movements in the US dollar have negatively correlated with S&amp;P 500 earnings changes. Excluding recessions and post-recession recoveries (since those skew the numbers significantly in either direction), earnings weakness for the S&amp;P 500 has coincided with dollar strength, whereas a weaker US dollar has correlated with stronger earnings growth.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-USD-vs-earnings-585x800.png))**

&gt; This makes some intuitive sense once you realize that 40% of S&amp;P 500 revenue comes from outside the US. The logic here is that if a company used to sell a machine abroad that generated the equivalent of $1,000 in the past, now that would be about $1,100 because the local currency rose 10% against the US dollar.

&gt; So, while the US economy is very relevant for S&amp;P 500 company earnings, much of it also hinges on what happens outside the US and what happens with the US dollar.

&gt;  # Why Is the Dollar Weakening?

&gt; It probably helps to understand why the dollar strengthened in the first place. The simplest explanation is that interest rate differentials between the US and other countries rose – the idea is that if interest rates are much higher in country A rather than country B, money will flow into country A, thus raising the value of that country’s currency.

&gt; The chart below shows the dollar index on the top panel, while the bottom panel shows the difference between 1-year US treasury yields and EU government 1-year yields. You can see how the dollar has moved higher when interest rate differentials climb, most notably after 2014 and in 2022. In contrast, the dollar has pulled back when the differential falls, which is what happened in 2019-2020 and this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-USD-vs-rate-differentials-601x800.png))**

&gt; Short-term interest rates, like 1-year yields, are an estimate of central bank target rates over the next year. 1-year yields in the US surged in 2022 because the Federal Reserve (Fed) raised rates to tame inflation. They were much more aggressive than their counterparts at the European Central Bank (ECB).

&gt; You can see the difference between the Fed and ECB’s target interest rates below. The differential jumped in 2022 but it’s been pulling back recently. The Fed’s taken its foot off the gas, while the ECB remains aggressive. Since the beginning of the year, the Fed has raised rates by 0.75%-points, whereas the ECB has raised it by 1.5%-points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-central-bank-target-rate-differentials-600x800.png))**

&gt; The reason is that US inflation has started to pull back, and is poised to fall further – see our blog from last week discussing this. In contrast, European inflation has remained stubbornly high, which has kept the ECB much more hawkish. In fact, core inflation (excluding volatile components like food and energy) is currently running at 6.8% year-over-year in the Eurozone. That compares to a 4.9% core CPI reading in the US. Up until September 2022, core inflation in the US was running higher than Eurozone core inflation – and then things switched, which shifted investor expectations and sent the dollar lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-core-inflation-US-vs-EU-800x609.png))**

&gt; We expect this dynamic to continue as US inflation eases further, while Europe deals with higher inflation and a more hawkish central bank. Tighter policy does create some headwinds for European equities, but that’s offset by a stronger currency. Combine this with the tailwind that a weaker dollar creates for S&amp;P 500 company earnings, and we are keeping our overweight to US equities while maintaining International developed market stocks at neutral. Emerging markets remain at underweight.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500's Best and Worst Performers During a Monster Week

&gt; After weaker-than-expected inflation data inflated the prices of just about every financial asset, there were some very big winners by the end of last week. The table below lists the 20 top-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 last week, which includes eight stocks that rallied more than 10%. Double-digit gains are typically considered very good for an entire year, so when large-cap stocks move that much in a week, it's impressive. Topping the list, shares of Match (MTCH) gained nearly 14% followed by DR Horton (DHI), Domino's (DPZ), and MGM Resorts (MGM). Among these four top performers and the other stocks listed, it is a somewhat eclectic group of stocks. One well-represented group on the list is the homebuilders. Along with DHI, Lennar (LEN) and Pulte (PHM) both also made the list. In terms of YTD returns, though, last week's biggest winners weren't solely the ones that have been rallying all along or the losers playing catch up; there was actually a little bit of everything. Three of the stocks listed (Etsy, Newell, and Sealed Air) are still down by double-digit percentages YTD while four (Pulte, Align, salesforce, and Monolithic Power) are up over 50%! Besides those extreme movers, there are also a few stocks that merely had single-digit YTD percentage gains before last week's spikes higher. One thing that just about all of these stocks have in common now, though, is that they headed into this week at short-term overbought levels of a varying degree.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071723-Best.png))**

&gt; In total, there were just 88 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that declined last week, and only 53 of those fell more than 1%. Of those 53 stocks, the table below lists the 20 worst performers which all fell more than 3%. This is also an eclectic group in terms of both their lines of business and their YTD performance heading into the week. The only stock down by double-digit percentages was Progressive (PGR) which now makes it down on the year as well. Right behind PGR, shares of Carnival (CCL) fell 9.5%, but unlike PGR, it's still up by over 100% YTD. Besides CCL, two other cruise operators (Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean) also sank during last week's rising tide, but they have also seen huge rallies on a YTD basis. Financials are another sector that was well-represented on last week's loser list. Besides PGR, State Street (STT), Allstate (ALL), Northern Trust (NTRS), Bank of NY Mellon (BK), and Travelers (TRV) all bucked last week's bullish trend. Unlike just about all of last week's winners which are now overbought, many of the week's worst performers are still trading within normal ranges of their 50-day moving averages.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and an awesome trading week ahead r/stocks. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Friday evening to all of you here on &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt;! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 24th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dow ekes out narrow gain Friday for 10th straight positive day, longest rally since 2017: Live updates - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks were mixed Friday as traders assessed the latest corporate earnings results, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average stretched its winning streak to 10 sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 30-stock Dow climbed 2.51 points, or 0.01%, to close at 35,227.69. The S&amp;amp;P 500 added 0.03% to end at 4,536.34, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.22% to finish the session at 14,032.81.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dow narrowly notched its tenth straight day of gains, a feat not seen for the index since August 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis, the S&amp;amp;P 500 added 0.69%, while the Dow gained 2.08%. It was the second positive week in a row for the two indexes. The Nasdaq fell 0.57% for the period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading was volatile Friday as portfolio managers recalibrated their funds to account for an unusual Nasdaq-100 rebalance taking effect Monday. A large volume of index and stock options also expired Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders were still eyeing more corporate earnings after a busy week of quarterly results. Transportation giant CSX fell 3.7% on the back of underwhelming results. American Express, meanwhile, dropped nearly 3.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate earnings have been mixed thus far. Seventy-five percent of S&amp;amp;P 500 companies that have already reported have exceeded analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet data. However, that beat rate is below a three-year average of 80%, according to The Earnings Scout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;″...Overall, early Q2 results appear good enough for equity markets to grind higher for now,” Barclays analyst Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Friday note. “Next week will be more indicative of the broad earnings dynamics, with ~50% of market cap reporting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;It’s a Bird. It’s A Plane! It’s … the US Economy!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just got a bunch of data to round out the economic picture in the second quarter (Q2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short: Not only do we see no sign of recession, but it also doesn’t even look like the economy is looking for a “landing” at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize this could change, but so far the data doesn’t indicate much weakness. Now, the monthly data can be volatile, and subject to revisions. So it helps to look at the last three months. Let’s walk through some of the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Consumption Was Strong&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retail sales rose at a 4.7% annual pace in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core retail sales, excluding categories like vehicle and gas station sales, rose at a 6.3% annual pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for inflation, “real” retail sales rose at a 1.9% annual pace in Q2, and are currently running 6% above the pre-crisis trend!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-20-real-retail-sales-1203x1600.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Supply Side Is Coming Back&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vehicle production rose 7.6% in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Production within the aerospace industry rose 4.7% in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-tech industries are running hot, with production up 3.9%, and almost 17% above pre-pandemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Production of business equipment outside of vehicles and high-tech also looks to have bottomed, which is a positive sign for capex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-20-IP-high-tech-and-business-equipment.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Construction is Booming&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-family housing permits and starts rose 11% in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An index measuring homebuilder sentiment continues to move higher, indicating that builders are getting more positive about future demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, total housing units under construction (single-family and multi-family) are near an all-time record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combine that with a boom in manufacturing construction, and its not a surprise why construction payrolls have increased by 88,000 this year and are about 339,000 above pre-pandemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-20-housing-construction-1201x1600.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;All These Points to Strong Economic Growth&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta Fed puts out a “nowcast” of quarterly real GDP growth that is updated with major economic data releases. Right now, it says the economy grew 2.4% in Q2, after adjusting for inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that is close to actual GDP growth in Q2, it would mean the economy grew 2.6% over the past year. That is not only stronger than the average 2.3% pace of growth between 2010 and 2019, but it also matches the pace of growth over the three years prior to the pandemic (2017-2019), when economic growth picked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is amazing is that the economy accelerated after a poor first half of 2022 even as the Federal Reserve hiked rates aggressively, taking the federal funds rate from 0.25% to 5.25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-20-real-gdp-growth-projected-1206x1600.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.6% over the past year, and headline inflation fell from 9% to 3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really doesn’t get better than that. Perhaps more importantly, there is no reason to believe a major slowdown is in the cards at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Seasonal Bump Absent in Claims Data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the many economic indicators updated this morning, seasonally adjusted initial jobless claims came in stronger than expected, falling to 228K. That reversed the recent jump in claims observed throughout the late spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/072023-Claims-1.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the non-seasonally adjusted data helps to explain the recent decline in the adjusted number. As shown below, barring the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, claims remain at one of the higher readings for the current week of the year in recent history. Typically, in late June and early July, seasonal headwinds cause a significant bump in claims. This year, that increase has been relatively modest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pivoting to continuing claims, the indicator had been on the decline since early April, but the first two weeks of July have seen a modest turn higher. At those levels, continuing claims remain in the middle of the range from the few years leading up to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bulls Dominate&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past week has provided some positive developments on the inflation front that in turn sent equities higher. In response, readings on investor sentiment have shown a dramatic positive turn. The latest AAII survey showed more than half of respondents reported as bullish for the first time since April 22, 2021. As we noted in today&amp;#39;s Morning Lineup, this week&amp;#39;s reading ended an over two-year-long streak without a reading above 50% which was the third longest such streak on record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the elevated reading of bullish sentiment, a minor share of respondents are reporting as bearish. In fact, that reading fell to 21.5% this week which is the lowest reading since June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year saw a record streak of weeks where bearish sentiment outnumbered bullish sentiment. With the total reversal in sentiment, the bull-bear spread now heavily favors bulls. The spread reached 29.9% this week for the highest reading since April 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gains to bullish sentiment have not entirely come from bears. Neutral sentiment is also reaching new lows, registering just 27.1% this week. Unlike bearish sentiment, that is only the lowest level since the last week of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tonight&amp;#39;s Closer we will discuss the surge in other sentiment indicators and what that has historically meant for S&amp;amp;P 500 performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;DJIA Advances for 8th Straight Day – Historically Bullish for Next 3 Months&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/646ff2a11a4a705724163ead66ed70d6/2fe5ab035e3861fd-b4/s500x750/2cf29a7ed0b4a7661967f45524f61e07137e7ab8.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the 54th time since 1950, DJIA has recorded a daily winning streak of at least eight days. This is DJIA’s first 8-day winning streak since 2019. During the current streak DJIA has advanced 3.93%. Of the prior 53 daily winning streaks lasting eight or more trading days, 26 ended at 8 days, 14 ended at 9 days, 8 made it to 10 days, while 2 made it to 11 and 12 days. DJIA’s longest daily winning streak of 13 days was in January 1987. DJIA also enjoyed an 8-day winning streak in July 1987. Based upon the last 53 streaks, there is only a modest 50.9% chance of the current streak continuing to 9 days or longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, daily winning streaks of 8-trading days or more have been bullish even after they ended. Over the 1-, 2-week, 1-, and 3-month periods after the daily winning streak ended DJIA was higher, 98.1%, 98.1%, 96.2% and 90.6% respectively. The only significant decline within 3 months of a daily streak end was a 19.22% loss in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reality Check for Housing Starts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a blockbuster report for May where Housing Starts and Building Permits both surged, there was a bit of a reality check in June. While Building Permits were expected to come in at 1.50 million, the actual reading came in at 1.44 million representing a 3.7% m/m decline and a drop of 15.3% y/y. One positive of this report, though, was that single-family units actually increased 2.2% and are only down 2.7% y/y even as multi-family units plunged 12.8% m/m and over 30% y/y. With respect to Housing Starts, the headline reading also missed estimates by 46K (1.434 mln vs 1.480 mln). Not only did June&amp;#39;s reading miss forecasts, but May&amp;#39;s reading was revised lower, so that the originally reported 231K beat was more like 159K. Even after that downward revision, though, Housing Starts declined 8.0% m/m and 8.1% y/y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following May&amp;#39;s report, we noted that the 12-month moving average of Housing Starts had broken its streak of 12 straight declines, but this month, the moving average resumed its downtrend and fell to its lowest level since February 2021. Similarly, the 12-month moving average for Building Permits declined below 1.49 million for the first time since December 2020 and posted its 11th straight decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071923-12-Month-average-Shorter-term.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a longer-term look at the 12-month moving average for Housing Starts, it remains in its well-established downtrend. As shown in the chart below, prior periods where this average peaked and started to rollover usually preceded recessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comparison of Housing Starts versus the performance of homebuilder stocks is a perfect example of how the market tends to trade in advance of events. Just as homebuilder stocks peaked four months ahead of the peak in Housing Starts, they bottomed five months in advance of the recent low in the three-month moving average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Homebuilders Hopeful&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing activity has been somewhat muted given a dearth of inventories, but the lack of available existing supply has been positive for homebuilders. The NAHB&amp;#39;s monthly survey of homebuilder sentiment moved higher in July for its seventh straight monthly gain. Even after the rebound, the current level of 56 represents just a 13-month high and is below the range of readings from the few years prior to the pandemic and historic readings in two years before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improvement in the headline index was primarily driven by increases in present sales and traffic. Geographically, the Midwest and South saw some modest softening in sentiment whereas the West and Northeast were much more impressive. The Northeast in particular saw an 8-point jump which ranks in the top decile of all monthly moves on record and brings the index into the top quartile of historical readings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although homebuilder sentiment has been rebounding solidly, it pales in comparison to the strength of homebuilder stocks. Proxied by the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB), homebuilders have continued to set new 52-week highs on a near-daily basis. The ETF has now risen 56% over the past year and has continuously traded in overbought territory (currently extremely overbought with a price more than 2 standard deviations above its 50-DMA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homebuilder earnings are also on deck in the next couple of weeks. Below, we show a screenshot from the Earnings Explorer function of our Custom Portfolios. As shown, all but three S&amp;amp;P 1500 Homebuilders are due to report through the first week of August. Of those, a vast majority have averaged positive moves on earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Dollar is Weakening – Why That’s Good for US Investors&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, we wrote in our 2023 Outlook that the US dollar was poised to weaken, creating tailwinds for Americans who invest in International stocks and S&amp;amp;P 500 earnings. We reiterated that this is starting to happen in our Mid-Year Outlook, “Edging Closer to Normal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows the recent swing in the ICE US Dollar Index, which measures changes in the US dollar against a basket of other currencies, including the euro, yen, British pound, and the Canadian dollar. It rose 27% between May ’21 and September ’22, but has pulled back 12% since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-US-dollar-index-600x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;A Boost for USD-Based International Equity Investors&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an investor in the US uses dollars to buy a basket of international stocks, the interim step is first converting those dollars to the local currency, which introduces currency risk. Note that when you see quotes for international stock exchanges, like the Nikkei (Japan) or the DAX (Germany), those are in local currency terms. To buy European stocks, you must first convert dollars to euros. Your returns are not just dependent on what the European stocks do; it’s also dependent on what happens to the euro relative to the dollar. If the euro appreciates against the dollar, that’s a tailwind to your investment, whereas a stronger dollar acts as a headwind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From September 30th of last year through July 14th, the MSCI EAFE Index, which represents a basket of international stocks across developed markets, outperformed the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index. The MSCI EAFE Index gained 35.2% versus 27.4% for the S&amp;amp;P 500. But as you can see from the table below, that outperformance is because of a tailwind from a weaker dollar. Emerging market stocks have also seen a tailwind from a weaker dollar but have underperformed due to a murky economic picture in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even over the past month and half (May 31st through July 14th), the dollar took a renewed plunge, boosting returns for international stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-USD-and-local-currency-returns-for-indices.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;A Tailwind for Earnings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, movements in the US dollar have negatively correlated with S&amp;amp;P 500 earnings changes. Excluding recessions and post-recession recoveries (since those skew the numbers significantly in either direction), earnings weakness for the S&amp;amp;P 500 has coincided with dollar strength, whereas a weaker US dollar has correlated with stronger earnings growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-USD-vs-earnings-585x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes some intuitive sense once you realize that 40% of S&amp;amp;P 500 revenue comes from outside the US. The logic here is that if a company used to sell a machine abroad that generated the equivalent of $1,000 in the past, now that would be about $1,100 because the local currency rose 10% against the US dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while the US economy is very relevant for S&amp;amp;P 500 company earnings, much of it also hinges on what happens outside the US and what happens with the US dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;# Why Is the Dollar Weakening?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It probably helps to understand why the dollar strengthened in the first place. The simplest explanation is that interest rate differentials between the US and other countries rose – the idea is that if interest rates are much higher in country A rather than country B, money will flow into country A, thus raising the value of that country’s currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows the dollar index on the top panel, while the bottom panel shows the difference between 1-year US treasury yields and EU government 1-year yields. You can see how the dollar has moved higher when interest rate differentials climb, most notably after 2014 and in 2022. In contrast, the dollar has pulled back when the differential falls, which is what happened in 2019-2020 and this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-USD-vs-rate-differentials-601x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short-term interest rates, like 1-year yields, are an estimate of central bank target rates over the next year. 1-year yields in the US surged in 2022 because the Federal Reserve (Fed) raised rates to tame inflation. They were much more aggressive than their counterparts at the European Central Bank (ECB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the difference between the Fed and ECB’s target interest rates below. The differential jumped in 2022 but it’s been pulling back recently. The Fed’s taken its foot off the gas, while the ECB remains aggressive. Since the beginning of the year, the Fed has raised rates by 0.75%-points, whereas the ECB has raised it by 1.5%-points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-central-bank-target-rate-differentials-600x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that US inflation has started to pull back, and is poised to fall further – see our blog from last week discussing this. In contrast, European inflation has remained stubbornly high, which has kept the ECB much more hawkish. In fact, core inflation (excluding volatile components like food and energy) is currently running at 6.8% year-over-year in the Eurozone. That compares to a 4.9% core CPI reading in the US. Up until September 2022, core inflation in the US was running higher than Eurozone core inflation – and then things switched, which shifted investor expectations and sent the dollar lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-18-core-inflation-US-vs-EU-800x609.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect this dynamic to continue as US inflation eases further, while Europe deals with higher inflation and a more hawkish central bank. Tighter policy does create some headwinds for European equities, but that’s offset by a stronger currency. Combine this with the tailwind that a weaker dollar creates for S&amp;amp;P 500 company earnings, and we are keeping our overweight to US equities while maintaining International developed market stocks at neutral. Emerging markets remain at underweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500&amp;#39;s Best and Worst Performers During a Monster Week&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After weaker-than-expected inflation data inflated the prices of just about every financial asset, there were some very big winners by the end of last week. The table below lists the 20 top-performing stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500 last week, which includes eight stocks that rallied more than 10%. Double-digit gains are typically considered very good for an entire year, so when large-cap stocks move that much in a week, it&amp;#39;s impressive. Topping the list, shares of Match (MTCH) gained nearly 14% followed by DR Horton (DHI), Domino&amp;#39;s (DPZ), and MGM Resorts (MGM). Among these four top performers and the other stocks listed, it is a somewhat eclectic group of stocks. One well-represented group on the list is the homebuilders. Along with DHI, Lennar (LEN) and Pulte (PHM) both also made the list. In terms of YTD returns, though, last week&amp;#39;s biggest winners weren&amp;#39;t solely the ones that have been rallying all along or the losers playing catch up; there was actually a little bit of everything. Three of the stocks listed (Etsy, Newell, and Sealed Air) are still down by double-digit percentages YTD while four (Pulte, Align, salesforce, and Monolithic Power) are up over 50%! Besides those extreme movers, there are also a few stocks that merely had single-digit YTD percentage gains before last week&amp;#39;s spikes higher. One thing that just about all of these stocks have in common now, though, is that they headed into this week at short-term overbought levels of a varying degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, there were just 88 stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500 that declined last week, and only 53 of those fell more than 1%. Of those 53 stocks, the table below lists the 20 worst performers which all fell more than 3%. This is also an eclectic group in terms of both their lines of business and their YTD performance heading into the week. The only stock down by double-digit percentages was Progressive (PGR) which now makes it down on the year as well. Right behind PGR, shares of Carnival (CCL) fell 9.5%, but unlike PGR, it&amp;#39;s still up by over 100% YTD. Besides CCL, two other cruise operators (Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean) also sank during last week&amp;#39;s rising tide, but they have also seen huge rallies on a YTD basis. Financials are another sector that was well-represented on last week&amp;#39;s loser list. Besides PGR, State Street (STT), Allstate (ALL), Northern Trust (NTRS), Bank of NY Mellon (BK), and Travelers (TRV) all bucked last week&amp;#39;s bullish trend. Unlike just about all of last week&amp;#39;s winners which are now overbought, many of the week&amp;#39;s worst performers are still trading within normal ranges of their 50-day moving averages.&lt;/p&gt;

AT&amp;T

The selloff in AT&amp;T shares appears overdone. With expected adjusted EPS of $2.40 for 2023, AT&amp;T stock now trades for a P/E ratio of 6.2. AT&amp;T has traded at an average price-to-earnings ratio of 11.2 over the last decade. We view AT&amp;T as undervalued, with a fair value P/E of 10. As a result, estimated returns for AT&amp;T of 18% per year, based on returns from an expanding valuation multiple, EPS growth, and dividends.

Verizon

We view Verizon as a strong dividend stock. In September 2022, Verizon announced that it was increasing its quarterly dividend 2% to $0.6525. The company has a dividend growth streak of 18 consecutive years.

Based off of the current share price and the midpoint of earnings guidance for 2023, Verizon has a forward P/E of 7.2.

https://i.imgur.com/LeAFFvS.jpg

&gt;Since the Federal Reserve began aggressively hiking interest rates last year, more and more economists warned that a US recession was imminent.

&gt;But that recession has not yet arrived, and there's no sign a recession is near even after reliable indicators like the inverted yield curve flashed red flags.

&gt;According to Societe Generale, ""something very strange has happened"" that explains why a US recession has been delayed, and it has to do with some timely moves made by corporations.

&gt;The bank highlighted that going back to at least 1975, corporate net interest payments would rise as the Fed raised interest rates. But for the first time in a long time, that isn't happening. Instead, as the Fed raised rates over the past 15 months, corporate net interest payments actually fell.

&gt;""Normally when interest rates rise, so too do net debt payments, squeezing profit margins and slowing the economy. But not this time,"" Societe Generale's Albert Edwards said in a Thursday note, pointing to a chart that he called the ""strangest"" he has seen in a very long time.

&gt;So, what exactly is happening?

&gt;It turns out that during the period of near-zero interest rates, especially leading up to the pandemic and during the pandemic, corporations took advantage and refinanced a ton of their liabilities into long-term, low-rate, fixed debt.

&gt;According to data from Bank of America earlier this year, companies bought themselves some time to navigate higher rates. **The debt composition of S&amp;P 500 companies includes just 6% in short-term floating rate debt, just 8% in long-term floating rate debt, 10% in short-term fixed debt, and a whopping 76% in long-term fixed debt.**

&gt;This ""helps explain the recession's tardiness,"" SocGen's Edwards said, highlighting that net interest payments have fallen 25% at a time when they would have risen sharply based on history.

&gt;**""Companies have effectively played the yield curve in reverse and become net beneficiaries of higher rates, adding 5% to profits over the last year instead of deducting 10%+ from profits as usual,"" Edwards said.**

&gt;The lack of a profit decline means companies didn't have to resort to a big wave of layoffs that would have dented the economy and thrown it into a recession.

&gt;The low-rate, long-term debt held by corporations, combined with their pricing power during a time of elevated inflation, means most businesses were able to grow profits in a big way.

&gt;""Interest rates simply aren't working as they once did. It is indeed a mad, mad world,"" Edwards concluded.

&gt;All of this could change if companies have to refinance their debt at higher rates. But with most of their debts not maturing until 2025, 2026, 2027 and beyond, it's possible that interest rates could move lower between now and then, enabling companies to continue to ride the coattails of low rates and ultimately stave off a recession.

&lt;p&gt;The low-rate, long-term debt held by corporations, combined with their pricing power during a time of elevated inflation, means most businesses were able to grow profits in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Interest rates simply aren&amp;#39;t working as they once did. It is indeed a mad, mad world,&amp;quot; Edwards concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this could change if companies have to refinance their debt at higher rates. But with most of their debts not maturing until 2025, 2026, 2027 and beyond, it&amp;#39;s possible that interest rates could move lower between now and then, enabling companies to continue to ride the coattails of low rates and ultimately stave off a recession.&lt;/p&gt;

428,stocks,"Due to weak fundamentals and other problems hurting the bank's performance, Wells Fargo's operating performance did not improve considerably in Q2 2023 despite an earnings and revenue beat. The bank's overall revenue has decreased due to difficulties in other areas like reduced loan origination and poorer trading gains, and the beat was mostly accredited to higher interest rates that remained for a longer period of time than expected. Although WFC's operational costs came slightly under $13 billion for the quarter, its efficiency ratio is at 63% and is predicted stay within 63-65% for future years, which indicates low efficiency.  
Wells Fargo's share price has been trading sideways for the past couple of years, indicating that the bank has other issues that have been a drag on its shares even though the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates at a pace over the past year, which theoretically is positive for banks and should be a support for higher share prices. Wells Fargo is a bank with a business profile that is heavily oriented towards retail and commercial banking, with less of a focus on investment banking. As a result, it is significantly exposed to increased interest rates. Therefore, even though Wells Fargo would profit from higher interest rates more than some of its direct competitors, the company's share price performance has not differed significantly from that of its peers in recent years due to weakness in other business segments.  
However, assuming that the Federal Reserve is reaching the end of its current rate hike cycle and may, hypothetically, decrease interest rates in 2024 or later, further increases in its efficiency ratio should come primarily from cost-cutting, an area where Wells Fargo has a pretty poor track record.  
At the end of June, its core tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 10.7%, comfortably above its capital requirement of 9.2%. Even though the bank's capital ratio dropped to 8.2% in the bad scenario—one of the greatest drops among U.S. large banks—its capital position is strong, as evidenced by the most recent stress test results. However, this capital ratio was far higher than the minimum required, demonstrating the bank's strong capitalization and ability to continue its capital return to shareholders programme.

#[Stock futures are higher after Dow registers longest winning streak since 2017: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were higher Friday as traders assessed the latest corporate earnings results, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average tried to stretch its winning streak to 10 sessions.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow added 32 points, up 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.2%, and Nasdaq-100 futures ticked up 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Transportation companies CSX and Knight-Swift fell 5% each in the premarket after reporting earnings that underwhelmed Wall Street analysts.
*****
&gt; Corporate earnings have been mixed thus far. Seventy-three percent of S&amp;P 500 companies that have already reported exceeding analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet data. However, that beat rate is below a three-year average of 80%, according to The Earnings Scout.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off an uneven session. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost around 0.7% and 2%, respectively. The Dow was the outlier of the three, adding nearly 164 points, or about 0.5%, for a nine-day rally — its longest since 2017 — and its highest close since March 2022.
*****
&gt; “The mixed broader indices are really reflective of the mixed earnings and economic data that’s come out,” said Greg Bassuk, CEO at AXS Investments. “Beyond Dow components, we’re seeing — across industries — more selling pressure based on these earnings results.”
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are on pace to finish the week up about 2.1% and 0.7%, while the Nasdaq is poised to end 0.4% lower with just Friday’s session remaining.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

At the risk of sounding stupid I'm still going to ask this question. Because if I don't asking dumb questions I might never learn.

The famous ETF IWDA which is very tech heavy (22.1% IT) and top 10 holdings are the big 7. Yet they didn't even drop after yesterdays big drop in tech (Tesla down 10%, Amazon, 3%,...) Nasdaq was down 2,2% and SP was down 0,6%.

Yet the IWDA valuation in Euro is higher then it was 48 hours ago. How is this possible?

443,stocks,"The world’s biggest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, has warned of a deepening semiconductor slump, as the boom in artificial intelligence fails to offset global economic woes and China’s delayed recovery.

TSMC now expects its 2023 revenue to drop by 10 per cent, rather than the less than 5 per cent it forecast three months ago, the Taiwanese company told investors on Thursday. This would translate into a 15 per cent revenue decrease in the second half of the year, compared with the same period in 2022.

“Three months ago we were probably more optimistic, but now [we are] not. The recovery of the Chinese economy is weaker than we thought, so end-market demand is not as we expected,” said CC Wei, chief executive. “Although we have very good AI end-market demand, it is not enough to offset [that weakness].”

The warning comes as the growth of large language models behind generative AI services such as ChatGPT is boosting the need for high-end processors for data centres, with TSMC making chips for Nvidia, whose AI processor business is booming.

446,stocks,"Hi,

In 2019 I invested about 70% of my networth (6 digits) in an ETF called IWDA.
I saw it as my savingsaccount that is extremely stressfree with little swings.

During the start of this year I was on Twitter alot and the sentiment was extremely bearish. Especially that guy KimDotCom made me scared about the trajectery of the USA.

Mid april I sold my whole ETF portfolio in the run up to 73€. I made a decent profit these 3 years of about 20%.

My mindstate was: this ship is going down, I will be able to buy back lower and if not I will find investments that will give a bigger return.

It dipped lower the week after, but I was cocky and didn't set my buy orders yet thinking it would dip way further.

Jokes on me, it never did, the market just went straight up and it's been bothering me ever since. It's such a stable ETF that even on red days like today it still doesn't go down. And I just live with pain and discomfort ever since. It is clear to me that I might never will be able to buy back at the the price I want.
I know the rules: time in the market beats timing the market, DCA, ... but I guess fear and greed got me.


Any advice books or courses on value investing? I can't just rebuy IWDA in this current mania but I can't just sit and do nothing either. So I want to just this opportunity to become a better value investor and use this situation to build a stronger portfolio that will outperform my previous one.

Things went from relatively stable 2-3% yoy inflation prior to covid, to a quick jump during 2021-2023.

So cpi July 2021 was 5% over July 2020, July '22 was 9% over 2021. July '23 will be 3% over 2022.

cumulative inflation is way up. After a slow steady price increase from 2010-2020, we got a big spike during 2021-2023, and now we resume a slow steady increase from here forward.

doing the math, total inflation is \~18%+ in 3 years since 2020. That's roughly 6-9 years worth of inflation pulled forward.

So what now? Looks like consumers are not consuming less; they are accepting the higher prices.

Now we just wait for wages to hurry up and go up 18% so consumers can pay off their credit card debt? iphone prices will never fall back down, so that means AAPL will reach $300 quicker.

# [Stock futures rise slightly after Dow posts a seventh straight day of gains: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/18/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures ticked higher Wednesday night after the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its longest winning streak since 2021.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.1% each. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures climbed 56 points, or 0.16%.
*****
&gt; Carvana shares dropped nearly 8% in premarket trading. The online auto retailer said Tuesday it will post second-quarter earnings results on Wednesday, moving the date of its report up from Aug. 3.
*****
&gt; The Dow notched a seventh straight positive session on Tuesday for its longest string of gains since March 2021. The Dow rose 366.58 points, or 1.06%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.71%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.76%. All three major averages notched their highest closes since April 2022.
*****
&gt; Those gains came as traders pored through quarterly reports from major companies.
*****
&gt; Thus far, the second-quarter earnings season is off to a strong start. Of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have reported results, 82% have exceeded expectations, according to FactSet data. For many investors, the recent streak of gains bolsters the case for a soft-landing scenario. It’s an outlook that has gained traction after last week’s encouraging inflation data.
*****
&gt; “I think that we have to take a hard-landing scenario off the table, and in part, as we approach 2024 it becomes more difficult for us to believe in a downward trajectory to earnings,” Alger’s Ankur Crawford said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “If you look at, you know, a lot of the tech earnings for example, we’ve troughed and now we’re starting to reaccelerate and grow again. That is a very different scenario than where we entered the year,” Crawford added.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs is set to report before the open Wednesday. Other major companies such as Netflix, Tesla, IBM and United Airlines will post earnings after the close.
*****
&gt; June housing data will release Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Housing starts are expected to have dropped by 9.3%, according to economists polled by Dow Jones. That would be down from the huge 21.7% jump in the prior month.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, June building permits are anticipated to have declined 0.7%, according to Dow Jones consensus estimates. That would be down from a 5.2% gain the previous month.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Wednesday, July 19th, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Wednesday, July the 19th, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/18/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures rise slightly after Dow posts a seventh straight day of gains: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures ticked higher Wednesday night after the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its longest winning streak since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.1% each. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures climbed 56 points, or 0.16%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carvana shares dropped nearly 8% in premarket trading. The online auto retailer said Tuesday it will post second-quarter earnings results on Wednesday, moving the date of its report up from Aug. 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dow notched a seventh straight positive session on Tuesday for its longest string of gains since March 2021. The Dow rose 366.58 points, or 1.06%. The S&amp;amp;P 500 gained 0.71%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.76%. All three major averages notched their highest closes since April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those gains came as traders pored through quarterly reports from major companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, the second-quarter earnings season is off to a strong start. Of the companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 that have reported results, 82% have exceeded expectations, according to FactSet data. For many investors, the recent streak of gains bolsters the case for a soft-landing scenario. It’s an outlook that has gained traction after last week’s encouraging inflation data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think that we have to take a hard-landing scenario off the table, and in part, as we approach 2024 it becomes more difficult for us to believe in a downward trajectory to earnings,” Alger’s Ankur Crawford said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you look at, you know, a lot of the tech earnings for example, we’ve troughed and now we’re starting to reaccelerate and grow again. That is a very different scenario than where we entered the year,” Crawford added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is set to report before the open Wednesday. Other major companies such as Netflix, Tesla, IBM and United Airlines will post earnings after the close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June housing data will release Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Housing starts are expected to have dropped by 9.3%, according to economists polled by Dow Jones. That would be down from the huge 21.7% jump in the prior month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, June building permits are anticipated to have declined 0.7%, according to Dow Jones consensus estimates. That would be down from a 5.2% gain the previous month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed in overnight trading as Wall Street looked ahead to a busy earnings day.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained just 5 points, while S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures fell marginally.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off a winning session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise for a sixth straight day and gain 76.32 points, or 0.22%, to notch its highest close of the year. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.39% and 0.93%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Wall Street awaits a packed earnings day Tuesday, with results on deck from Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon and PNC Financial. Earnings from Lockheed Martin and J.B. Hunt are on deck.
*****
&gt; The season comes as recent inflation data boosts the case for a soft-landing scenario among many investors, and stocks continue this year’s rally. But some skepticism lingers.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think we’re in a sweet spot,” SoFi’s Liz Young said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “You wouldn’t have those negative leading indicators, and even some of the concurrent indicators, if we were in a sweet spot.”
*****
&gt; On the economic front, retail sales and industrial production data for June are due out Tuesday.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, July 18th, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Tuesday, July the 18th, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures are little changed ahead of busy earnings day: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock futures were little changed in overnight trading as Wall Street looked ahead to a busy earnings day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained just 5 points, while S&amp;amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures fell marginally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks are coming off a winning session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise for a sixth straight day and gain 76.32 points, or 0.22%, to notch its highest close of the year. The S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.39% and 0.93%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street awaits a packed earnings day Tuesday, with results on deck from Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon and PNC Financial. Earnings from Lockheed Martin and J.B. Hunt are on deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The season comes as recent inflation data boosts the case for a soft-landing scenario among many investors, and stocks continue this year’s rally. But some skepticism lingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we’re in a sweet spot,” SoFi’s Liz Young said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “You wouldn’t have those negative leading indicators, and even some of the concurrent indicators, if we were in a sweet spot.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the economic front, retail sales and industrial production data for June are due out Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

The fact that the bank declared a solid balance sheet during and after a highly tumultuous time for the banking industry is, in my opinion, more significant.   
The last one or two quarters have been described by certain media as the most difficult for banks since the 2008 crisis. JPM was able to keep a healthy standardised CET1 capital ratio of 13.8% even after the First Republic deal. J.P. Morgan was able to negotiate a favourable price because they were the only reliable buyer for FRC. In a back-of-the-envelope analysis of the transaction, Matt Levine of Bloomberg noted how J.P. Morgan receives good upside and regulatory protection while sharing a large portion of the potential losses if the loans default. Although the estimated $500 million in annual net income for the agreement is small in comparison to the $40 billion or so they already generate, it demonstrates that a bank like JPMorgan can take advantage of the crisis.  
The bank currently has $1.4 trillion in cash and short-term securities, which is a lot of liquidity. I have no doubt that JPM will be able to fulfil these new standards and keep its fortress balance sheet, even though there may be some capital changes and liquidity in the near future as the banking industry adapts to new rules.  
Given the current instability in the banking industry, regulatory standards may be modified in various ways.

518,stocks,"**WASHINGTON, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Monday the United States was making good progress in bringing inflation down and she did not expect the U.S. economy to enter into a recession.**

Yellen, speaking to Bloomberg TV from India during a meeting of Group of 20 finance officials, said slower growth in China could spill over to other economies, but the U.S. economy was on ""a good path"" to reducing inflation while the labor market remained strong.

""For the United States, growth has slowed, but our labor market continues to be quite strong. I don't expect a recession,"" Yellen said. ""The most recent inflation data were quite encouraging.""

Data on Monday showed China's economy grew 6.3% in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis, accelerating from 4.5% in the first three months of the year, but well below expectations of 7.3%, as demand weakened at home and abroad.

U.S. data released last month showed gross domestic product increased at a 2% annualized rate in the first quarter, a sharp upward revision from the 1.3% pace reported earlier, but still below the 2.6% growth reported in the fourth quarter.

Yellen downplayed the prospect for U.S. tariff cuts or reductions as part of the Biden administration's push to reestablish relations with Beijing.

She said Chinese officials raised serious concerns, especially about U.S. tariffs, during her visit earlier this month, but the underlying reasons that Washington implemented them in the first place, including unfair trade practices, had not been addressed.

""We have to see what comes out of the four-year review"" of tariffs, Yellen said, adding, ""But I would emphasize that really the underlying concerns have not yet been addressed. And we need to work on that going forward.""

She said U.S. technology restrictions aimed at China were not meant to be ""tit for tat,"" but were focused on national security concerns, and in some cases, human rights abuses.

Yellen said the United States was likely to proceed with a new executive order restricting outbound investment that has also sparked concerns in China, but stressed that these would focus narrowly on three sectors - semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence.

""They would contain a combination of notification requirements, and in a very narrowly scoped portion of these sectors, prohibitions, but these would not be broad controls that would affect U.S. investment broadly in China,"" she said.

Asked if the order was finished, Yellen said, ""We want to make sure that we get it right, and we've been working on the details.""

She said there was a ""good chance"" it would happen, but said it would come with a notice of proposed rulemaking, giving the public a chance to comment on any proposed controls.

Yellen said she did not know about the hacking of emails of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other government officials by a group based in China and did not discuss it with Chinese officials, but said the U.S. government had raised its concerns with Beijing.

531,stocks,"An aging population that values its free time set the stage for economic stagnation. Then came Covid-19 and Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Europeans are facing a new economic reality, one they haven’t experienced in decades. They are becoming poorer.

Life on a continent long envied by outsiders for its art de vivre is rapidly losing its shine as Europeans see their purchasing power melt away. 

The French are eating less foie gras and drinking less red wine. Spaniards are stinting on olive oil. Finns are being urged to use saunas on windy days when energy is less expensive. Across Germany, meat and milk consumption has fallen to the lowest level in three decades and the once-booming market for organic food has tanked. Italy’s economic development minister, Adolfo Urso, convened a crisis meeting in May over prices for pasta, the country’s favorite staple, after they jumped by more than double the national inflation rate.

With consumption spending in free fall, Europe tipped into recession at the start of the year, reinforcing a sense of relative economic, political and military decline that kicked in at the start of the century. 


Europe’s current predicament has been long in the making. An aging population with a preference for free time and job security over earnings ushered in years of lackluster economic and productivity growth. Then came the one-two punch of the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s protracted war in Ukraine. By upending global supply chains and sending the prices of energy and food rocketing, the crises aggravated ailments that had been festering for decades. 

Governments’ responses only compounded the problem. To preserve jobs, they steered their subsidies primarily to employers, leaving consumers without a cash cushion when the price shock came. Americans, by contrast, benefited from inexpensive energy and government aid directed primarily at citizens to keep them spending.

In the past, the continent’s formidable export industry might have come to the rescue. But a sluggish recovery in China, a critical market for Europe, is undermining that growth pillar. High energy costs and rampant inflation at a level not seen since the 1970s are dulling manufacturers’ price advantage in international markets and smashing the continent’s once-harmonious labor relations. As global trade cools, Europe’s heavy reliance on exports—which account for about 50% of eurozone GDP versus 10% for the U.S.—is becoming a weakness. 

Private consumption has declined by about 1% in the 20-nation eurozone since the end of 2019 after adjusting for inflation, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based club of mainly wealthy countries. In the U.S., where households enjoy a strong labor market and rising incomes, it has increased by nearly 9%. The European Union now accounts for about 18% of all global consumption spending, compared with 28% for America. Fifteen years ago, the EU and the U.S. each represented about a quarter of that total.

Adjusted for inflation and purchasing power, wages have declined by about 3% since 2019 in Germany, by 3.5% in Italy and Spain and by 6% in Greece. Real wages in the U.S. have increased by about 6% over the same period, according to OECD data. 


The pain reaches far into the middle classes. In Brussels, one of Europe’s richest cities, teachers and nurses stood in line on a recent evening to collect half-price groceries from the back of a truck. The vendor, Happy Hours Market, collects food close to its expiration date from supermarkets and advertises it through an app. Customers can order in the early afternoon and collect their cut-price groceries in the evening. 

“Some customers tell me, because of you I can eat meat two or three times per week,” said Pierre van Hede, who was handing out crates of groceries.

Karim Bouazza, a 33-year-old nurse who was stocking up on half-price meat and fish for his wife and two children, complained that inflation means “you almost need to work a second job to pay for everything.”

Similar services have sprung up across the region, marketing themselves as a way to reduce food waste as well as save money. TooGoodToGo, a company founded in Denmark in 2015 that sells leftover food from retailers and restaurants, has 76 million registered users across Europe, roughly three times the number at the end of 2020. In Germany, Sirplus, a startup created in 2017, offers “rescued” food, including products past their sell-by date, on its online store. So does Motatos, created in Sweden in 2014 and now present in Finland, Germany, Denmark and the U.K.

Spending on high-end groceries has collapsed. Germans consumed 52 kilograms of meat per person in 2022, about 8% less than the previous year and the lowest level since calculations began in 1989. While some of that reflects societal concerns about healthy eating and animal welfare, experts say the trend has been accelerated by meat prices which increased by up to 30% in recent months. Germans are also swapping meats such as beef and veal for less-expensive ones such as poultry, according to the Federal Information Center for Agriculture.

Thomas Wolff, an organic-food supplier near Frankfurt, said his sales fell by up to 30% last year as inflation surged. Wolff said he had hired 33 people earlier in the pandemic to handle strong demand for pricey ecological foodstuffs, but he has since let them all go.

Ronja Ebeling, a 26-year-old consultant and author based in Hamburg, said she saves about one-quarter of her income, partly because she worries about having enough money for retirement. She spends little on clothes or makeup and shares a car with her partner’s father. 


Weak spending and poor demographic prospects are making Europe less attractive for businesses ranging from consumer-goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble to luxury empire LVMH, which are making an ever-larger share of their sales in North America.

“The U.S. consumer is more resilient than in Europe,” Unilever’s chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, said in April.

The eurozone economy grew about 6% over the past 15 years, measured in dollars, compared with 82% for the U.S., according to International Monetary Fund data. That has left the average EU country poorer per head than every U.S. state except Idaho and Mississippi, according to a report this month by the European Centre for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based independent think tank. If the current trend continues, by 2035 the gap between economic output per capita in the U.S. and EU will be as large as that between Japan and Ecuador today, the report said.

On the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, businesses are lobbying for more flights to the U.S. to increase the number of free-spending American tourists, said Maria Frontera, president of the Mallorca Chamber of Commerce’s tourism commission. Americans spend about €260 ($292) per day on average on hotels compared with less than €180 ($202) for Europeans.

“This year we have seen a big change in the behavior of Europeans because of the economic situation we are dealing with,” said Frontera, who recently traveled to Miami to learn how to better cater to American customers.

Weak growth and rising interest rates are straining Europe’s generous welfare states, which provide popular healthcare services and pensions. European governments find the old recipes for fixing the problem are either becoming unaffordable or have stopped working. Three-quarters of a trillion euros in subsidies, tax breaks and other forms of relief have gone to consumers and businesses to offset higher energy costs—something economists say is now itself fueling inflation, defeating the subsidies’ purpose. 

Public-spending cuts after the global financial crisis starved Europe’s state-funded healthcare systems, especially the U.K.’s National Health Service.

Vivek Trivedi, a 31-year-old anesthesiologist living in Manchester, England, earns about £51,000 ($67,000) per year for a 48-hour workweek. Inflation, which has been about 10% or higher in the U.K. for nearly a year, is devouring his monthly budget, he says. Trivedi said he shops for groceries in discount retailers and spends less on meals out. Some colleagues turned off their heating entirely over recent months, worried they wouldn’t be able to afford sharply higher costs, he said.

Noa Cohen, a 28-year old public-affairs specialist in London, says she could quadruple her salary in the same job by leveraging her U.S. passport to move across the Atlantic. Cohen recently got a 10% pay raise after switching jobs, but the increase was completely swallowed by inflation. She says friends are freezing their eggs because they can’t afford children anytime soon, in the hope that they have enough money in future. 

“It feels like a perma-freeze in living standards,” she said.


Huw Pill, the Bank of England’s chief economist, warned U.K. citizens in April that they need to accept that they are poorer and stop pushing for higher wages. “Yes, we’re all worse off,” he said, saying that seeking to offset rising prices with higher wages would only fuel more inflation.

With European governments needing to increase defense spending and given rising borrowing costs, economists expect taxes to increase, adding pressure on consumers. Taxes in Europe are already high relative to those in other wealthy countries, equivalent to around 40-45% of GDP compared with 27% in the U.S. American workers take home almost three-quarters of their paychecks, including income taxes and Social Security taxes, while French and German workers keep just half. 

The pauperization of Europe has bolstered the ranks of labor unions, which are picking up tens of thousands of members across the continent, reversing a decades long decline. 


Higher unionization may not translate into fuller pockets for members. That’s because many are pushing workers’ preference for more free time over higher pay, even in a world of spiraling skills shortages.

IG Metall, Germany’s biggest trade union, is calling for a four-day work week at current salary levels rather than a pay raise for the country’s metalworkers ahead of collective bargaining negotiations this November. Officials say the shorter week would improve workers’ health and quality of life while at the same time making the industry more attractive to younger workers.



Almost half of employees in Germany’s health industry choose to work around 30 hours per week rather than full time, reflecting tough working conditions, said Frank Werneke, chairman of the country’s United Services Trade Union, which has added about 110,000 new members in recent months, the biggest increase in 22 years. 

Kristian Kallio, a games developer in northern Finland, recently decided to reduce his working week by one-fifth to 30 hours in exchange for a 10% pay cut. He now makes about €2,500 per month. “Who wouldn’t want to work shorter hours?” Kallio said. About one-third of his colleagues took the same deal, although leaders work full-time, said Kallio’s boss, Jaakko Kylmäoja.

Kallio now works from 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. He uses his extra free time for hobbies, to make good food and take long bike rides. “I don’t see a reality where I would go back to normal working hours,” he said.

Igor Chaykovskiy, a 34-year-old IT worker in Paris, joined a trade union earlier this year to press for better pay and conditions. He recently received a 3.5% pay increase, about half the level of inflation. He thinks the union will give workers greater leverage to press managers. Still, it isn’t just about pay. “Maybe they say you don’t have an increase in salary, you have free sports lessons or music lessons,” he said.

Mathias Senn, right, a butcher in Germany’s wealthy Black Forest region, couldn’t find local applicants to replace four workers who are preparing to retire, so he hired an apprentice from India, Rajakumar Bheemappa Lamani. 

At the Stellantis auto factory in Melfi, southern Italy, employees have worked shorter hours for years recently due to the difficulty of procuring raw materials and high energy costs, said Marco Lomio, a trade unionist with the Italian Union of Metalworkers. Hours worked have recently been reduced by around 30% and wages decreased proportionally. 

“Between high inflation and rising energy costs for workers,” said Lomio, “it is difficult to bear all family expenses.” 

https://www.wsj.com/articles/europeans-poorer-inflation-economy-255eb629","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;An aging population that values its free time set the stage for economic stagnation. Then came Covid-19 and Russia’s war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europeans are facing a new economic reality, one they haven’t experienced in decades. They are becoming poorer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life on a continent long envied by outsiders for its art de vivre is rapidly losing its shine as Europeans see their purchasing power melt away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French are eating less foie gras and drinking less red wine. Spaniards are stinting on olive oil. Finns are being urged to use saunas on windy days when energy is less expensive. Across Germany, meat and milk consumption has fallen to the lowest level in three decades and the once-booming market for organic food has tanked. Italy’s economic development minister, Adolfo Urso, convened a crisis meeting in May over prices for pasta, the country’s favorite staple, after they jumped by more than double the national inflation rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With consumption spending in free fall, Europe tipped into recession at the start of the year, reinforcing a sense of relative economic, political and military decline that kicked in at the start of the century. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s current predicament has been long in the making. An aging population with a preference for free time and job security over earnings ushered in years of lackluster economic and productivity growth. Then came the one-two punch of the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s protracted war in Ukraine. By upending global supply chains and sending the prices of energy and food rocketing, the crises aggravated ailments that had been festering for decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments’ responses only compounded the problem. To preserve jobs, they steered their subsidies primarily to employers, leaving consumers without a cash cushion when the price shock came. Americans, by contrast, benefited from inexpensive energy and government aid directed primarily at citizens to keep them spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, the continent’s formidable export industry might have come to the rescue. But a sluggish recovery in China, a critical market for Europe, is undermining that growth pillar. High energy costs and rampant inflation at a level not seen since the 1970s are dulling manufacturers’ price advantage in international markets and smashing the continent’s once-harmonious labor relations. As global trade cools, Europe’s heavy reliance on exports—which account for about 50% of eurozone GDP versus 10% for the U.S.—is becoming a weakness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private consumption has declined by about 1% in the 20-nation eurozone since the end of 2019 after adjusting for inflation, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based club of mainly wealthy countries. In the U.S., where households enjoy a strong labor market and rising incomes, it has increased by nearly 9%. The European Union now accounts for about 18% of all global consumption spending, compared with 28% for America. Fifteen years ago, the EU and the U.S. each represented about a quarter of that total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjusted for inflation and purchasing power, wages have declined by about 3% since 2019 in Germany, by 3.5% in Italy and Spain and by 6% in Greece. Real wages in the U.S. have increased by about 6% over the same period, according to OECD data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pain reaches far into the middle classes. In Brussels, one of Europe’s richest cities, teachers and nurses stood in line on a recent evening to collect half-price groceries from the back of a truck. The vendor, Happy Hours Market, collects food close to its expiration date from supermarkets and advertises it through an app. Customers can order in the early afternoon and collect their cut-price groceries in the evening. &lt;/p&gt;

I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.

However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.

I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.

The plan:  
\-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)  
\-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)  
\-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)  
\-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)  
\-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)  
\-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)  
\-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)

Some possible additions right now:  
\-Considering Invesco **S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&amp;P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)  
\-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)  
\-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)  
\-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)  
\-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)  
\-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)  
\-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)  
\-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)  
\-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)  
\-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)

So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?

-Considering &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt; MSF, &lt;strong&gt;Meta&lt;/strong&gt; FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)&lt;br/&gt;
-Considering &lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt; (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)&lt;br/&gt;
-&lt;strong&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Class B&lt;/strong&gt; BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)&lt;br/&gt;
-Considering &lt;strong&gt;Palantir&lt;/strong&gt; PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)&lt;br/&gt;
-Considered &lt;strong&gt;Nvidia&lt;/strong&gt; (FOMO)&lt;br/&gt;
-Considered &lt;strong&gt;IBM&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Intel&lt;/strong&gt; as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don&amp;#39;t think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)&lt;/p&gt;

533,stocks,"India will likely be a major driver of Apple’s five-year revenue and installed base growth, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note Monday, citing Apple’s investment in manufacturing in India and the country’s “economic boom.”

The note also reflected a new India-driven price target increase, from $190 to $220, with a bull-case valuation increased to $270. Morgan Stanley also reiterated Apple as their Top Pick.

Morgan Stanley analysts forecast that over the next five years, the country could account for 15% of Apple’s revenue growth — in contrast to 2% in the past five years and $6 billion today — and 20% of the company’s installed base growth.

The revenue growth, which Morgan Stanley forecasts at $40 billion over the next 10 years, would be the “equivalent to Apple ramping an entirely new product category.”

The analysts cite a number of factors in their assessment, including India’s improved electrification and Apple’s clear efforts to build a manufacturing and retail presence in the country. A survey commissioned by Morgan Stanley suggested Indian consumers have an increased desire and ability to purchase iPhones.

Analysts did add a caveat, warning that if India fails to meet its economic and demographic growth marks, “we wouldn’t expect Apple to be as significant of a beneficiary in India.”

But Morgan Stanley’s fundamental thesis is bullish. “All-in, this means that India will be just as important to Apple’s growth algorithm over the next 5+ years as China was in the last 5 years, something we believe the market underappreciates today,” the analysts said.

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Monday ahead of a busy week for corporate earnings.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 54 points, or 0.16%, while S&amp;P 500 futures slipped 0.05%. Futures connected to the Nasdaq-100 traded 0.1% higher.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off a winning week that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average gain 2.3% to notch its best weekly gain since March. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 2.4% and 3.3%, respectively. On Friday, the Dow rose 113.89 points, or 0.33%, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq slipped 0.1% and 0.18%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The moves came on the heels of solid big bank earnings and softer inflation reports that lifted investor sentiment. That heightened some hopes the Federal Reserve may be able to tamp down inflation without tipping the economy into a recession.
*****
&gt; “It’s the Goldilocks scenario, it’s inflation coming down with near record low unemployment,” Kathryn Rooney Vera, chief market strategist at StoneX, told CNBC’s “Last Call” on Friday. “Yes, people have some pain ... with prices, but they have jobs. Evidence is increasingly favorable for the soft landing viewpoint, and immaculate disinflation is what has the market going crazy.”
*****
&gt; Second-quarter earnings season gains steam this week with results from big financial institutions such as Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Results are also due from United Airlines, Las Vegas Sands and technology giants Tesla and Netflix.
*****
&gt; Wall Street are bracing for what be a gloomy season with lower profits. Analysts forecast a more than 7% decline in S&amp;P 500 earnings from a year ago, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; This week also ushers in the Fed’s “blackout period” ahead of its July policy meeting. Traders anticipate a near 97% chance the central bank increases interest rates later this month, after pausing hikes in June, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.

Cathie Wood’s flagship exchange-traded fund has rallied more than 50% this year. Investors are using that as an opportunity to get out.

They have pulled a net $717 million from the ARK Innovation ETF over the past 12 months, according to FactSet. That exodus marks a notable shift for a fund that had consistently drawn investor cash since its 2014 inception. Once the largest actively managed ETF with nearly $30 billion in assets under management, the fund has shrunk to roughly $9 billion, mostly due to investment losses.

Known by its ticker symbol ARKK, Wood’s fund became an investor darling shortly after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic with hugely successful bets on unprofitable and “disruptive” technology companies. It took in huge amounts of investor money, culminating with a $6.5 billion inflow in the first quarter of 2021, when its share price peaked.

Then, the Federal Reserve’s fastest interest-rate hiking campaign in decades crushed the valuations of unprofitable growth companies, which often attract investors when interest rates are low and returns on safer investments such as CDs are minimal. Shares of ARKK plunged 67% in 2022, but its investors largely held on or bought the dip. Now, analysts say they expect some of those investors are getting out for good.

“You have a whole group of people who got in somewhere near the top and are sitting on horrific losses,” said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Capital Management, which operates an inverse ETF that lets investors bet against Wood’s fund. “I think some of those people have said, ‘I’m never getting back to even; this is probably the best I’m going to do, and it’s time to get out.’”

Wood says the outflows have been small compared with the fund’s assets.

“We have been astonished at our asset retention since February of ‘21,” Wood said in an interview. “It’s a very small number as a percentage of assets, which suggests that it’s far more likely to be people who are taking some profits than some exodus of people who have stayed in the fund through a prolonged down period.”

Despite the recent rally, ARKK shares are trading about 70% below their all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 has climbed 17% this year on hopes the Fed is near the end of its tightening effort; it is still down 6.1% from its early 2022 high.

ARKK’s top five holdings are Tesla, Coinbase Global, Roku, Zoom Video Communications and Block. Only Tesla and Zoom were profitable last year. Tesla holds an 11% weight in the fund, helping power its advance this year. Shares of the electric-vehicle maker have more than doubled in 2023 but, like ARKK, are down sharply from their previous high.

Although technology stocks are strongly back in favor this year, the best performers have mostly been mature, profitable companies that generate significant cash, such as Microsoft and Amazon.com. Unlike two years ago, investors appear to have less interest and patience for companies that aren’t expected to turn a profit until years in the future. Higher interest rates have meant there is a much higher opportunity cost to wait for profitability.

“There’s certainly been a change in sentiment from when the ARK funds were doing really well,” said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA Research. “A lot of the stocks the ETF holds won’t have big cash flows until way out in the future, and it’s a more challenging environment for that with rates expected to be higher for longer.”

Investors say the ARK brand lost its luster after the fund’s prodigious fall. It took another hit after missing out on the monster rally in shares of Nvidia, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the boom of interest in artificial-intelligence technology. ARKK sold the last of its Nvidia position in January, a stake that had long been one of its largest holdings. Nvidia has been the S&amp;P 500’s best performer this year, more than tripling.

“The bloom is off the rose a little bit,” Tuttle said.

Wood says the negative publicity over the past two years has been an opportunity for ARK to solidify its brand as an asset manager focused on disruptive innovation.

“I can tell you at the end of ’20 and early ‘21, when we couldn’t do anything wrong and people were just chasing, I felt very uncomfortable,” she said. “Today, I feel very comfortable. We are not seeing that kind of behavior. That tells me there is a wall of worry out there. And that usually sustains a bull market.”

The outflows at ARK are coming while ETF investors appear eager to put money to work in other funds. June was the best month for equity ETF flows since October, according to State Street, while active funds attracted $10 billion of inflows for the month and more than $100 billion over the past 12 months.

Investors displayed “childlike exuberance” and “jumped into the market’s rally with both feet,” Matthew Bartolini, head of Americas research for State Street’s ETF business, said in a research note.

The ARKK fund has an 11% annualized average return since inception, but the average ARKK investor has lost 21% on a dollar-weighted, annualized basis, according to FactSet.

“ARKK shareholders have not timed their purchases well. Many bought high and have yet to sell,” said Elisabeth Kashner, director of global funds research at FactSet.

The fund remains a cash cow for Wood, who owns a majority stake in its parent company, ARK Investment Management. Its 0.75% annual fee is about double the average fee for active ETFs.

Although fee revenue is well off its 2021 peak, ARKK has generated more than $20 million of fees this year. ARK Investment Management currently has the third-highest daily revenue from active equity ETFs, of at least 145 different issuers, according to an analysis from FactSet.

To be sure, the market comeback staged by many of ARKK’s tech-focused holdings surprised many, highlighting the perils of trying to forecast performance.

“If you just look at rates, you would not have expected this great rebound in growth coming into the year,” said Dana D’Auria, co-chief investment officer at Envestnet. “It’s a classic window into why market prognostication doesn’t work. Who would have thought artificial intelligence would boom and create this massive interest?”

Let's say I have my own model/prediction about a growth stock, that in exactly 10 years will completely stop making progress, and will just keep making the same amount of money. 

I'm a long term investor, I will predict future revenues - profits, because If the stock stops growing according to my thesis, nothing changes, then revenue doesn't matter - margin won't change it will all magically just become static and flat, profits is the only thing that stays the company's asset the way I see it in this hypothetical made up scenario.

So then, I'm left with this model, that will value a stock based on profits the company will be making in 10 years, what value could that be according to the market ? If the company pay a dividend, is that gonna be the factor that defines the company's value, either dividend, wasted investments, or investments into growth, so it becomes more of a growth stock again, unless it becomes a dividend, so is this whole thing about dividends  ?

How do I convert dividends into stock value ? What has the market usually agreed upon on average ?

Anyone got some clarity to this ? What am I missing or not undersanding

What I forgot to ask about the dividends was, is it like, is there like a formula agreed upon that say some shit like 10 years * dividends$ * some number = value, even though it may still fluctuate and not be in total corellation to the conventionally agreed value because of human emotions, or further made up predictions about the company's future and it's ability to pay more or less dividends, without all the noise, just pure signal, what is a value of a stock conventionally ?

549,stocks,"World’s Top Anime Site Crunchyroll Is Sony’s New Money Maker

When top anime streaming platform Crunchyroll was first gaining popularity as a pirated-video site in the mid-2000s, Japanese animation was considered a niche form of entertainment, appealing mainly to enthusiasts known as otaku. Today, it’s a $20 billion industry spanning streaming, games and merchandise, and the company’s hit series, such as One Piece and Demon Slayer, have drawn millions of US and European subscribers.

Crunchyroll, now owned by Sony Group Corp., is setting its sights on India as a major growth market — one that could help the industry further expand from a made-in-Japan subculture into a mainstream and global phenomenon.

The company, founded in 2006 by graduates of the University of California at Berkeley, started off as an anime-sharing site. It eventually began streaming only legitimate content, helped by investment from venture capitalists including former News Corp. President Peter Chernin and ownership by AT&amp;T Inc.’s WarnerMedia. Now the largest anime-dedicated streaming platform in the world, it was bought by Sony in a $1.2 billion deal announced in 2020.

Crunchyroll has more than 100 million registered members, including 11 million paid users, after rapid subscriber growth during the pandemic when people binge-watched exotic content. With growth in Western markets moderating, the anime giant is looking to India for its next breakthrough, according to President Rahul Purini.
“In terms of percentage growth, India will be a significant driver of our growth,” Purini said in an interview ahead of a business trip next week to Mumbai, where he plans to meet potential partners. “They’re small numbers right now, but we believe they will become a significant portion of our subscriber base.”

Crunchyroll is seeing more anime fans in new markets such as South America and Southeast Asia. Expansion in India, with its burgeoning youth population, could prove particularly helpful in turbocharging Sony’s efforts to boost its entertainment content business.

In May, Sony Chief Executive Officer Kenichiro Yoshida shared the company’s long-term vision of increasing users of content, including music, games and movies, by over sixfold to 1 billion people. India is seen as a crucial battleground in that effort, particularly as China remains closed. US streaming services such as Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. are also competing for a bigger audience in India, where the media and entertainment industry is expected to grow by around 10% annually to $60 billion in 2030.

In India, Sony is also closing in on a merger with local TV and film business Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd., a deal that would create a $10 billion media giant.
Sony bought Crunchyroll through affiliate Funimation, a US home-video distributor also running an anime streaming platform. The integration of the two companies during the pandemic was “the biggest challenge” but is well underway, according to Purini, a Funimation veteran. The migration of content and subscribers from Funimation to Crunchyroll is likely to be completed fairly soon, he said.

Crunchyroll’s strategy for India is to acquire more content and to localize anime series using dubbing and subtitles in local languages such as Hindi. The streaming platform recently lowered its prices in the region, which at around $1 a month is roughly a 10th of the price for a comparable, middle-tier plan in the US.

Ironically, the biggest challenge for Crunchyroll is its fight against illegal streaming websites, which are rampant in India. Crunchyroll believes its competitive pricing and unique features will eventually persuade users to opt for paid services.
“If we do our job right, we can convince fans to switch over to an official site,” Purini said. “The other part is that we work in collaboration with our partners, whether it’d be Sony Pictures, whether it’d be our Japanese partners, using all the lawful means at our disposal to be able to talk to fans and address the anti-piracy issue.”

Crunchyroll expects the anime industry will have more than 800 million fans globally by 2025 outside markets in China and Japan. Of those, around 200 million are expected to watch series on official websites, he said. The business is open to acquiring assets to grow in targeted markets, he added.

Sony doesn’t reveal financial details for Crunchyroll, and Purini declined to share detailed sales or profit numbers. Analysts have said that while anime is still a small part of Sony’s chips-to-movies business empire, it’s emerging as a key growth area.
Goldman Sachs upgraded its recommendation on Sony to a “buy” on Thursday, citing expectations for Crunchyroll. Analyst Minami Munakata estimates that in five years, the anime site will account for 36% of all profit at Sony’s picture’s segment, which includes its Hollywood studio and content business, up from just 1% in the year ended in March.

“Given that Crunchyroll is being rolled out in more areas and that demand for dedicated anime streaming services is likely to increase in regions other than North America as the growth of Japanese anime continues overseas, we expect the number of Crunchyroll paid subscribers will increase in the next five years, with regions other than North America becoming the main drivers,” she said in a note.

“Japanese anime is worth more outside of Japan than inside now, and this growth will continue,” Omdia senior analyst James McWhirter said, noting strong box office results for titles such as Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen. He noted that some anime is now being produced outside Japan, including in the US and China.

“Local anime is also challenging Japanese anime, but also supporting the overall growth of the market,” McWhirter said. “The pie will get bigger.”

The biggest competitor to Crunchyroll right now is Netflix, which is also betting big on growing anime fandom. Anime is a popular category among Netflix users in Japan, while Crunchyroll isn’t offering its streaming service in Japan to avoid competing with its local partners. More than half of Netflix’s global subscribers outside Japan watched at least one anime title in 2021, and time spent watching anime has been increasing, according to the company.

Purini said he welcomed competition from Netflix as well as Amazon and Walt Disney Co., as their investments could help grow anime’s overall audience. The new fans, he said, could later turn to Crunchyroll to explore the category more deeply.

The company also remains dedicated to its so-called flywheel strategy of offering fans a broad range of services from streaming and theatrical releases to anime-related merchandise. In addition to its expansion in India, he said, Crunchyroll is also discussing the use of new technologies such as AR and VR in partnerships with big tech companies.

“We want to be everything for someone rather than something for everyone,” Purini said.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;World’s Top Anime Site Crunchyroll Is Sony’s New Money Maker&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When top anime streaming platform Crunchyroll was first gaining popularity as a pirated-video site in the mid-2000s, Japanese animation was considered a niche form of entertainment, appealing mainly to enthusiasts known as otaku. Today, it’s a $20 billion industry spanning streaming, games and merchandise, and the company’s hit series, such as One Piece and Demon Slayer, have drawn millions of US and European subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crunchyroll, now owned by Sony Group Corp., is setting its sights on India as a major growth market — one that could help the industry further expand from a made-in-Japan subculture into a mainstream and global phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company, founded in 2006 by graduates of the University of California at Berkeley, started off as an anime-sharing site. It eventually began streaming only legitimate content, helped by investment from venture capitalists including former News Corp. President Peter Chernin and ownership by AT&amp;amp;T Inc.’s WarnerMedia. Now the largest anime-dedicated streaming platform in the world, it was bought by Sony in a $1.2 billion deal announced in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crunchyroll has more than 100 million registered members, including 11 million paid users, after rapid subscriber growth during the pandemic when people binge-watched exotic content. With growth in Western markets moderating, the anime giant is looking to India for its next breakthrough, according to President Rahul Purini.
“In terms of percentage growth, India will be a significant driver of our growth,” Purini said in an interview ahead of a business trip next week to Mumbai, where he plans to meet potential partners. “They’re small numbers right now, but we believe they will become a significant portion of our subscriber base.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crunchyroll is seeing more anime fans in new markets such as South America and Southeast Asia. Expansion in India, with its burgeoning youth population, could prove particularly helpful in turbocharging Sony’s efforts to boost its entertainment content business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, Sony Chief Executive Officer Kenichiro Yoshida shared the company’s long-term vision of increasing users of content, including music, games and movies, by over sixfold to 1 billion people. India is seen as a crucial battleground in that effort, particularly as China remains closed. US streaming services such as Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. are also competing for a bigger audience in India, where the media and entertainment industry is expected to grow by around 10% annually to $60 billion in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India, Sony is also closing in on a merger with local TV and film business Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd., a deal that would create a $10 billion media giant.
Sony bought Crunchyroll through affiliate Funimation, a US home-video distributor also running an anime streaming platform. The integration of the two companies during the pandemic was “the biggest challenge” but is well underway, according to Purini, a Funimation veteran. The migration of content and subscribers from Funimation to Crunchyroll is likely to be completed fairly soon, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crunchyroll’s strategy for India is to acquire more content and to localize anime series using dubbing and subtitles in local languages such as Hindi. The streaming platform recently lowered its prices in the region, which at around $1 a month is roughly a 10th of the price for a comparable, middle-tier plan in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

551,stocks,"Economists are dialing back recession risks.

Easing inflation, a still-strong labor market and economic resilience led business and academic economists polled by The Wall Street Journal to lower the probability of a recession in the next 12 months to 54% from 61% in the prior two surveys. 

While that probability is still high by historical comparison, it represents the largest month-over-month percentage-point drop since August 2020, as the economy was recovering from a short but sharp recession induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. It reflects the fact that the economy has kept growing even as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates and inflation declined. 

In the latest WSJ survey, economists expected gross domestic product to have grown at a 1.5% annual rate in the second quarter, a sharp uptick from 0.2% in the previous survey. They still expect GDP to eventually contract, but later, and by less, than previously. They expect the economy to grow 0.6% in the third quarter, in contrast to the 0.3% contraction expected in the prior survey, followed by a 0.1% contraction in the fourth. Forecasters said GDP would increase 1% in 2023, measured from the fourth quarter of a year earlier, double the previous forecast of 0.5%. 

Nearly 60% of economists said their main reason for optimism about the economic outlook is their expectation that inflation will continue to slow. The Labor Department’s consumer-price index climbed 3% in June from a year earlier, sharply lower than the peak of 9.1% in June 2022 and the slowest in more than two years. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure—the annual change in the personal-consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy—has fallen from 5.4% in March 2022 to 4.6% in May. Economists expect it to reach 3.7% by the fourth quarter of this year, though that is still well above the Fed’s 2% target.
Pathway to a soft landing

Many economists first began in the middle of last year to project a recession when persistently high inflation prompted the Fed to raise rates at the most aggressive pace in nearly three decades. Historically, lowering the inflation rate materially has always involved higher unemployment and a downturn, and few economists thought this time would be different. 




Now, a pathway to achieve a “soft landing,” or getting inflation down without a recession, is “back on the table,” said Sean Snaith, the director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Forecasting. “At the beginning of this year it seemed more of a pipe dream,” said Snaith. Now, “it seems a recession keeps slipping, slipping, slipping into the future.” Snaith has lowered the probability of recession to 45% from 90% in April.

On average, economists still expect the labor market will lose 10,551 jobs a month in the first quarter of 2024, broadly unchanged from their previous forecast. But unlike in the April survey, economists no longer expect job cuts in the third and fourth quarter of this year. They expect employers will add jobs in the second and third quarters of next year, suggesting any downturn will be mild. 

“Inflation has slowed remarkably already, and we believe will continue to do so because spending growth is slowing substantially and the growth in labor force is helping service providers,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. 

Still, stronger-than-expected economic growth this year will also likely result in the Fed keeping interest rates higher for longer, according to the Journal survey. 

Economists expected the midpoint of the range for the federal-funds rate will peak at 5.4% in December, up sharply from a 5% forecast in the last survey. The latest prediction implies at least one more 25-basis-point increase by the Fed. 
More rate increases, later rate cuts

The Fed last month held its benchmark federal-funds rate steady in a range between 5% and 5.25%, its first pause after 10 consecutive increases since March 2022. Market participants overwhelmingly expect the central bank will raise rates by a quarter-percentage point at its July 25-26 meeting, according to the federal-funds futures market.


Economists are also pushing back their estimates for when the Fed will eventually start cutting rates. In the latest survey, only 10.6% of economists expected a rate cut in the second half of this year, down from 36.8% in the last survey. The majority of economists, nearly 79%, expected the Fed will cut rates in the first half of 2024 as the unemployment rate rises. Some 42.4% expected that first cut will come in the second quarter.

Economists are relatively sanguine about the impact of the end of the government’s pandemic-era pause on student-debt payments, which allowed millions of Americans to avoid a big monthly bill for more than three years.

The resumption of student-loan payments is expected to have a relatively minor impact this fall, shaving 0.2 percentage points, annualized, from consumer spending growth, measured from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of this year.

“We will likely see some slowing in spending growth toward the end of this year as a result of the resumed payments denting certain households’ ability to consume, but we do not think the end to the payment pause will be widespread enough to have a significant effect on overall U.S. household spending,” said Wells Fargo chief economist Jay Bryson.

\-He anticipates that at the first sign of trouble, the Fed will go back to more QE

Because of our ever-widening trade deficit, a weaker dollar causes imported goods to be more expensive, adding to inflationary pressures.

Yes you missed the gravy train with LLY and NVO. On a side note LLY has the upper hand with Mounjaro AND LLY has new triple combo gut boosters in the pipelines. Anyways that is a topic for another day.

WW bought Sequence who can prescribe these GLP-1 therapies. This is pretty big IMO. I was hoping to get your thoughts on WW.

I get also a lot of consults for obesity, and time and time again, patients report that for a high intensity intervention, the FIRST thing people say is WW.

Patients would love to get access to these. I have patients calling in daily for samples. A telehealth company + WW to help with lifestyle IMO is massive.

I plan to buy HEAVY into WW soon on next paycheck. Saxenda, which is based on victoza for DM should have patents expire soon, which may mean generic option, and it works very well. Rather than see a specialist or primary, these telehealth companies, with their lifestyle (still first line for weight loss) plus GLP-1 therapies, is going to be a good selling point IMO.

559,stocks,"If you had to guess, how much money do American households have sitting in their bank accounts today compared to December 31, 2019?  

The answer: household checkable deposits is up a whopping 300% in the last 4 years.    The more I dug into this the more confused I became. 

Here are the household asset levels for different asset types over the last four years.  
Q4 2019 ——&gt;Q1 2023 in millions  

Checkable deposits: from 980,550 to 4,188,022   
Money market: from 2,159,362 to 3,175,515  
Time deposits: from 9,552,703 to 9,525,293  
Corporate equities: from 29,122,532 to 35,820,586  

The growth rate of Checkable deposits has far outpaced other asset classes at a time where the big banks are not offering competitive interest rates. The pre COVID all time high was just 1.26 trillion.  

I know the explanation that most will jump on is that the 1% is just hoarding cash but that doesn’t fully explain the jump.   

The data splitting out the data by wealth brackets hasn’t been updated since Q2 2022 but prior to then there was a 6X jump for the 50-90th wealth percentile and the bottom half in wealth’s bank account balances grew from 102,426 pre COVID to 277,455 in Q2 2022.  

Most of the jump occurred during COVID stimulus spending but has still grown slightly over the last four quarters of data.  

I found this baffling and was wondering if anyone has a good explanation for this.  

My main ideas are that people have saved up money to pay off student loans that’s still sitting in bank accounts or that a lot of people are saving up to buy houses but I was wondering if anyone else had any better ideas.  

Nevertheless, there is a ton of cash sitting on the sidelines. If households decide to pile more money into the stock market they have a lot of ammunition to power the bull market higher.

562,stocks,"Hey y’all, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole that is quantum computing and I’m convinced it will have some significant impact and scalable use cases within the coming years (5-10…+?).

When it comes to investment opportunities relating to emerging/experimental technologies, it can be difficult for retail investors to find early-stage direct investment opportunities. 

BUT, the standout player, IonQ ($IONQ) is publicly traded. Here are some reasons why I’m bullish and think IonQ is oh, so special!

1. IonQ uses trapped ion/photonic computing!! This is really neat because it means their quantum computers do not need to be kept at FREEZING temps like QCs being created by Google, IBM, Rigetti and most others. (Among many other advantages) 

Compared to the trapped ion approach, the qubits generated via superconducting suffer from short coherence times, high error rates, limited connectivity, and higher estimated error-correction overhead

2. Management is fairly new to running a public company but they seem excited and dedicated based off interviews and press releases: “The lead is ours. And we have full intention to take advantage of it.”

3. IonQ is the first and only quantum hardware integrated with all major cloud platforms and software kits!

4. 80% of their system is made outside of the US

5. 55+ US patents, 136 US patents pending, 7 foreign patents, 99 foreign patents pending, 8 US trademarks, 11 US trademarks pending, 17 international trademarks, 7 international trademarks pending

6. Their approach for the near term is to form a limited number of strategic partnerships to develop solutions that open up quantum advantage in select industry sectors (chem, pharma, finance, logistics).

7. What I think sets them apart the most, besides trapped ion, is their focus on scalability. Since their inception, Peter Chapman, their CEO, has been stressing the importance of their QCs being modular, economical, and serviceable. THIS, in my opinion, is the way. Whereas Google and IBM will have huge, frozen, immobile QCs available to contract via the cloud, IonQ will have a portable, scalable product.

564,stocks,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 17th, 2023.

# **Dow closes 100 points higher Friday on solid earnings, registers best week since March: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed Friday as strong earnings results from some of the biggest banks and companies kicked off earnings season.
*****
&gt; The 30-stock Dow added 113.89 points, or 0.33%, to close at 34,509.03 and mark its fifth consecutive day of gains. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.10% to close at 4,505.42. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.18%, ending at 14,113.70. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq touched their highest intraday levels since April 2022.
*****
&gt; On a weekly basis, the Dow notched its best performance since March, up 2.3%. The S&amp;P 500 added 2.4%, and the Nasdaq gained 3.3%.
*****
&gt; UnitedHealth shares lifted the blue-chip index Friday as its top performer. The insurance giant jumped more than 7% after it reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings and revenue. The company also raised the lower end of its full-year adjusted earnings guidance. UnitedHealth was also the biggest gainer in the S&amp;P 500′s health-care sector, which advanced 1.5%.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan Chase rose 0.6% after its second-quarter earnings topped expectations. The bank was boosted by higher interest rates and rising interest income. Wells Fargo inched down 0.3%, even though the bank posted better-than-expected results.
*****
&gt; “What we’ve seen out of big bank earnings, especially JPMorgan, is pretty resilient,” said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments.
*****
&gt; “We’re seeing right now [that] default rates are still historically incredibly low and not showing signs of skyrocketing higher. So that’s a good sign for consumers and the economy,” Ladner added.
*****
&gt; Expectations for this season are downbeat, with analysts forecasting a roughly 7% year-over-year drop in S&amp;P 500 earnings, according to FactSet. That would mark the worst earnings season since the second quarter of 2020, when S&amp;P 500 profits dropped 31.6%.
*****
&gt; Investors’ sentiment has been lifted by soft inflation reports this week. The latest producer price index report showed inflation rose less than anticipated and built on trader optimism from the June consumer price index data, which came out Wednesday. Investors are now considering whether a strong economy illustrated by the recent data could push stocks higher by the end of the year.
*****
&gt; “The Goldilocks scenario is alive and well, in terms of declining inflation pressures and [there’s] still fairly robust economic growth. So it’s a pretty good backdrop for risk assets,” said Ladner.

&gt; # NASDAQ Down 5 Straight During July Monthly Options Expiration Week

&gt; Since 1982, the Friday of monthly options expiration week has a bearish bias for DJIA declining 23 times in 41 years with two unchanged years, 1991 and 1995. On Friday the average loss is 0.23% for DJIA and 0.25% for S&amp;P 500. NASDAQ’s record is even weaker, down 25 of 41 years with an average loss of 0.38%. DJIA posts the best full-week performance, up 24 of 41 with an average 0.37% gain. However, NASDAQ has been weakest, down 22 times and the last five straight. The week after monthly options expiration leans bearish for NASDAQ over the longer-term with an average loss. In recent years the track record had been improving until 2015’s across the board, greater than 2% loss.

&gt; # The Path to Lower Inflation is Now Clear

&gt; The June CPI report was a positive surprise, both in terms of the headline numbers as well as the underlying details.

&gt; Headline inflation rose 0.2% in June, which translates to a 2.2% annual pace. Over the past three months, inflation’s averaged about 2.7%, and over the last year it’s up 3.0%. That’s well off the peak pace of over 9% exactly a year ago.

&gt; In my opinion, the reason for the decline is obvious when you look at the chart below. Energy prices drove the inflation surge in 2022, especially after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Energy prices have now declined 17% over the past year, pulling inflation lower. The good news is that food inflation is also easing a lot, rising at an annual pace of just 1.3% over the past 3 months. Remember the surge in egg prices? Well, egg prices have fallen 21% over the past 3 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-headline-CPI-breakdown-698x800.png))**

&gt; All this of course has been occurring for a few months now and shouldn’t be a big surprise.

&gt; The problem until now was that “core inflation,” i.e., inflation once you strip out energy and food prices, remained elevated. But we got good news on that front.

&gt; Core inflation rose just 0.16% in June, which translates to a 1.9% annual pace — the slowest monthly pace since August 2021! That’s great, but as you can see below, the 3-month pace remains above 4%. So, we’ve yet to see a consistent deceleration in core inflation, which is what the Federal Reserve is looking for.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-headline-and-core-CPI-3M-607x800.png))**

&gt; **Positive signs**

&gt; We realize that one month does not make a trend, but a lot of the underlying details point to downward momentum. Let’s look at a few of these.

&gt; Used and new vehicle prices, which make up 9% of the core inflation “basket,” have reversed a lot over the past year. However, used car prices rose in April and May, reversing some of that momentum. But things look to have turned around once again, with used car prices falling 0.5% in June. In fact, prices are likely to fall further over the next few months based on private used car auction data (Ryan pointed this out in his previous blog as well).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-used-car-prices-597x800.png))**

&gt; Moreover, the auto production supply chain bottlenecks are being resolved, and therefore we’re seeing vehicle production increase. As a result, prices for new vehicles have fallen about 0.4% over the past three months, and that downtrend is likely to continue given increased supply.

&gt; The big one is housing inflation, which Ryan and I have been talking a lot about over the past year. Housing makes up 40% of core inflation, but importantly, it does not include home prices. Instead, it’s based on rents. The problem is that there is a significant lag between official rental inflation and private rents data. Private data from Apartment List shows that rents have decelerated from a peak of 18% year-over-year pace to zero as of June! Official data lags this data by about 12 months or so and it’s taken a while to reflect market reality.

&gt; The good news is that official rental inflation appears to be turning lower. Rental inflation was averaging a 9% annual pace between June 2022 and February 2023. However, that’s fallen to about 6% over the past 4 months. That’s still higher than the 2018-2019 average of about 3-3.5%. But given what we’re seeing in market rents, we expect housing inflation to continue decelerating and that’s going to pull core inflation down in a big way later this year and into 2024 as well.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-rents-598x800.png))**

&gt; **What about the rest?**

&gt; Fed Chair Powell has cited “core services ex housing” as still being elevated. We believe it’s their way of saying,

&gt; “Yes, we see vehicle prices heading lower, and acknowledge the lags in housing inflation data; but we want to see the rest of it fall”

&gt; But there’s good news on that front too.

&gt; The Atlanta Federal Reserve calculates something called the “Sticky Price CPI excluding food, energy, and shelter.” Simply put, it measures inflation for items whose prices typically don’t change frequently.

&gt; In June, this sticky price measure was flat. Over the past 3 months it’s running at a 1.4% annual pace, well below the peak of 7.3% we saw 15 months ago. A key piece of this is restaurant food prices, which have slowed down a lot recently on the back of falling food prices. But even things like airfares, daycare and pet care services inflation have been falling.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-sticky-price-CPI-638x800.png))**

&gt; You can see why the June inflation report was positive from so many angles. A low reading is positive by itself, but it also confirmed what we know from other sources about what to expect going forward.

&gt; Perhaps the best news is that inflation is falling, and poised to fall even further, without a rise in unemployment and an economic slowdown. A year ago, Federal Reserve officials and many economists were saying that we probably need to go into a recession for inflation to slow down, and that aggressive rate hikes by the Fed would push us into one.

&gt; Instead, the unemployment rate is at 3.6%, close to 50-year lows. If real GDP growth clocks in around 2% for last quarter (as seems likely), that would mean the economy’s grown at a 2.5% pace over the past year. While inflation’s fallen from 9% to 3%. That’s huge!

&gt; From its close on June 27 (the fourth from last trading day) through today, NASDAQ has gained 2.7% which makes this year’s NASDAQ midyear rally slightly better than average. Today’s gains were largely fueled by better than anticipated CPI reading. Provided this translates into a better-than-expected PPI report tomorrow, additional gains are likely before NASDAQ’s midyear rally officially ends on Friday, July 14. The end of the rally also coincides with the historical seasonal mid-month July market peak in pre-election years. Since 1950, the second half of July has been weaker than the first half.

&gt; # Inflation Expectations Still on the Decline

&gt; Ahead of Wednesday's CPI, the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCES) was released earlier this week and showed a continuation of the trend where consumer inflation expectations have been falling. Over the next 12 months, the Fed's survey showed that the median expected rate of inflation fell from 4.07% down to 3.83%. While still above its historical average of 3.4%, consumer expectations for inflation over the next year are down to the lowest level since April 2021. Over a longer time horizon, inflation expectations haven't fallen nearly as fast, but they didn't rise anywhere near as much as short-term expectations either. In the June survey, the median expected rate of inflation over the next three years fell from 2.98% down to 2.95%. While that reading barely budged, we would note that current expectations for inflation over the next three years are slightly below the long-term average. Unlike the FOMC, which ditched the term transitory 18 months ago, consumers have remained on team transitory.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/071123-NY-Fed-Inflation-Exp.png))**

&gt; One issue which has the potential to push inflation higher is how consumers expect their incomes to change over time. In this month's survey, the median expected rate of earnings growth increased from 2.80% up to 2.98% which is right around the high end of its range from the last two years. As shown in the chart below, while this series has tested the 3% level multiple times, it hasn't been able to bust through it. As it pertains to inflation, that's a good thing, because if consumers expect their incomes to increase, they're probably also less likely to push back on higher prices. At the same time, the fact that this reading has settled into a new higher range relative to its long-term average suggests that getting back down to and staying at levels of inflation that prevailed before COVID may prove to be difficult.

&gt; # Small-caps Catch a Bid

&gt; Small-caps have caught a bid over the last few days with the Russell 2,000 ETF (IWM) rallying more than 3% since last Thursday's close. Over the same time frame, the large-cap S&amp;P 500 is up just 0.3%.

&gt; While large-cap indices have recently traded to 52-week highs, small-caps are still well below 2023 highs made back in Q1. As shown below, though, IWM is currently attempting to break above the top end of the sideways range it has been in over the last month. If it can do that, the highs from earlier in the year will come into sight.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/smalluse.png))**

&gt; The Russell 2,000 (IWM) chart looks pretty interesting over a multi-year time frame. As shown below, the pre-COVID high made in early 2020 has acted as strong support over the past year. While IWM fell sharply during the mini-banking crisis this March, it stopped going down once it reached this key support level, and then it traded sideways and consolidated throughout much of April and May. Going forward, it appears that the Russell has built a strong base over the past year to springboard off of if the bull market for US equities can continue.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/rtyiwm.png))**

&gt; A chart that always captures our attention is the one below that shows Apple's (AAPL) market cap versus the combined market cap of all of the stocks in the small-cap Russell 2,000. Prior to COVID, Apple's market cap wasn't even close to the $2+ trillion market cap of the Russell 2,000. Since late 2021, though, the two have been battling it out. After its huge gain in Q2, Apple is currently in the lead at $2.96 trillion, but the Russell isn't too far behind at $2.81 trillion.

&gt; # Here We Go Again

&gt; “Here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I’ve ever known.”

&gt; -Here I Go Again by Whitesnake

&gt; One of the main reasons we came into 2023 overweight equities (when everyone else was talking recessions and bear markets) was the over-the-top negativity. Rarely is the crowd and obvious trade right when it comes to investing and we assumed should we get any good news, stocks could surprise to the upside. One of the most staggering signs of negativity was the median strategist in this Bloomberg survey was looking for negative stock returns in ’23.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/blog-1.jpg))**

&gt; As we noted in Is Anyone Bullish? (from December 11, 2022), we’d never seen strategists this bearish heading into a new year. Then layer on the fact that stocks were down close to 20% in 2022 and the odds greatly favored a big bounce back year, as stocks were rarely down two years a in a row. Not to mention, the macro backdrop was on much better footing than the M2 is crashing, LEI is down, and yield curve fearmongers were telling us.

&gt; All that happened was that the first six months of this year was the second best start to a year since 2000 for the S&amp;P 500, best start for the NASDAQ in 40 years and the best start ever for the NASDAQ-100.

&gt; Where are we now? Well, similar to the great Whitesnake song in the quote above, here I go again, down the only road I’ve ever known.

&gt; Apparently, the only road these strategists know is doubling down on lower prices, as they expect the most bearish second half EVER. We’ll gladly take the other side to this, as we expect stocks to gain nicely the rest of this year, likely to new all-time highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/blog-2.jpg))**

&gt; Take note the other years they expected lower prices during the final six months of the year were 1999, 2019, 2020, and 2021. All the S&amp;P 500 did those years was gain 7.0%, 9.8%, 21.2%, and 10.9%, respectively, over the final six months. That comes out to a very impressive 12.2% average, not bad, not bad.

&gt; What also has my attention? We have some big inflation data out this week, but we’ve already seen some nice signs that inflation could surprise to the downside. First up, used cars accounted for nearly a third of the jump in inflation the past few years, but it is crashing lower, with used car prices experiencing their largest monthly drop since COVID. Given light auto production is running close to pre-COVID levels, this is another sign supply chains are working again and price pressures are abating.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/blog-3_edit-800x450.png))**

&gt; Speaking of supply chains, the New York Fed Global Supply Chain Pressure Index did jump last month, but it was coming off of the lowest level in history. Bottom line, supply chains are back to normal after years of disruptions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/blog-4-800x309.png))**

&gt; Along with supply chains and used car prices improving, we expect to see shelter take a big dive the second half of this year. Remember, shelter makes up more than 40% of CPI and it has stayed stubbornly high lately. Well, we’ve seen drastic improvements from private data places like Apartment List and Zillow, suggesting that the government’s data will likely follow suit soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/blog-5-598x800.png))**

&gt; Lastly, we’ve been hearing a lot that the trillions of dollars in excess savings that consumers had over COVID was nearly all the way gone. The media are spinning this as a bearish event, as it means consumers aren’t saving anymore and they will run out of money to spend and keep the economy growing. Here’s the issue with that, the savings rate has been trending higher the past year and is more than two percent higher than it was in early 2022. The employment backdrop is still healthy, spending is solid and consumer confidence is improving. To us, all of that is positive.

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dow closes 100 points higher Friday on solid earnings, registers best week since March: Live updates - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed Friday as strong earnings results from some of the biggest banks and companies kicked off earnings season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 30-stock Dow added 113.89 points, or 0.33%, to close at 34,509.03 and mark its fifth consecutive day of gains. Meanwhile, the S&amp;amp;P 500 dropped 0.10% to close at 4,505.42. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.18%, ending at 14,113.70. Both the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq touched their highest intraday levels since April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis, the Dow notched its best performance since March, up 2.3%. The S&amp;amp;P 500 added 2.4%, and the Nasdaq gained 3.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth shares lifted the blue-chip index Friday as its top performer. The insurance giant jumped more than 7% after it reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings and revenue. The company also raised the lower end of its full-year adjusted earnings guidance. UnitedHealth was also the biggest gainer in the S&amp;amp;P 500′s health-care sector, which advanced 1.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase rose 0.6% after its second-quarter earnings topped expectations. The bank was boosted by higher interest rates and rising interest income. Wells Fargo inched down 0.3%, even though the bank posted better-than-expected results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve seen out of big bank earnings, especially JPMorgan, is pretty resilient,” said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing right now [that] default rates are still historically incredibly low and not showing signs of skyrocketing higher. So that’s a good sign for consumers and the economy,” Ladner added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expectations for this season are downbeat, with analysts forecasting a roughly 7% year-over-year drop in S&amp;amp;P 500 earnings, according to FactSet. That would mark the worst earnings season since the second quarter of 2020, when S&amp;amp;P 500 profits dropped 31.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors’ sentiment has been lifted by soft inflation reports this week. The latest producer price index report showed inflation rose less than anticipated and built on trader optimism from the June consumer price index data, which came out Wednesday. Investors are now considering whether a strong economy illustrated by the recent data could push stocks higher by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Goldilocks scenario is alive and well, in terms of declining inflation pressures and [there’s] still fairly robust economic growth. So it’s a pretty good backdrop for risk assets,” said Ladner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;NASDAQ Down 5 Straight During July Monthly Options Expiration Week&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/0e35ad96acb434fc8ff47cfbe253ba09/4a5924a75bd97043-2b/s500x750/f43f7c12a146f12f283341caf2e57d15204eef2f.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1982, the Friday of monthly options expiration week has a bearish bias for DJIA declining 23 times in 41 years with two unchanged years, 1991 and 1995. On Friday the average loss is 0.23% for DJIA and 0.25% for S&amp;amp;P 500. NASDAQ’s record is even weaker, down 25 of 41 years with an average loss of 0.38%. DJIA posts the best full-week performance, up 24 of 41 with an average 0.37% gain. However, NASDAQ has been weakest, down 22 times and the last five straight. The week after monthly options expiration leans bearish for NASDAQ over the longer-term with an average loss. In recent years the track record had been improving until 2015’s across the board, greater than 2% loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Path to Lower Inflation is Now Clear&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The June CPI report was a positive surprise, both in terms of the headline numbers as well as the underlying details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headline inflation rose 0.2% in June, which translates to a 2.2% annual pace. Over the past three months, inflation’s averaged about 2.7%, and over the last year it’s up 3.0%. That’s well off the peak pace of over 9% exactly a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the reason for the decline is obvious when you look at the chart below. Energy prices drove the inflation surge in 2022, especially after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Energy prices have now declined 17% over the past year, pulling inflation lower. The good news is that food inflation is also easing a lot, rising at an annual pace of just 1.3% over the past 3 months. Remember the surge in egg prices? Well, egg prices have fallen 21% over the past 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-headline-CPI-breakdown-698x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this of course has been occurring for a few months now and shouldn’t be a big surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem until now was that “core inflation,” i.e., inflation once you strip out energy and food prices, remained elevated. But we got good news on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Core inflation rose just 0.16% in June, which translates to a 1.9% annual pace — the slowest monthly pace since August 2021! That’s great, but as you can see below, the 3-month pace remains above 4%. So, we’ve yet to see a consistent deceleration in core inflation, which is what the Federal Reserve is looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-headline-and-core-CPI-3M-607x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We realize that one month does not make a trend, but a lot of the underlying details point to downward momentum. Let’s look at a few of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used and new vehicle prices, which make up 9% of the core inflation “basket,” have reversed a lot over the past year. However, used car prices rose in April and May, reversing some of that momentum. But things look to have turned around once again, with used car prices falling 0.5% in June. In fact, prices are likely to fall further over the next few months based on private used car auction data (Ryan pointed this out in his previous blog as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-used-car-prices-597x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the auto production supply chain bottlenecks are being resolved, and therefore we’re seeing vehicle production increase. As a result, prices for new vehicles have fallen about 0.4% over the past three months, and that downtrend is likely to continue given increased supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big one is housing inflation, which Ryan and I have been talking a lot about over the past year. Housing makes up 40% of core inflation, but importantly, it does not include home prices. Instead, it’s based on rents. The problem is that there is a significant lag between official rental inflation and private rents data. Private data from Apartment List shows that rents have decelerated from a peak of 18% year-over-year pace to zero as of June! Official data lags this data by about 12 months or so and it’s taken a while to reflect market reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that official rental inflation appears to be turning lower. Rental inflation was averaging a 9% annual pace between June 2022 and February 2023. However, that’s fallen to about 6% over the past 4 months. That’s still higher than the 2018-2019 average of about 3-3.5%. But given what we’re seeing in market rents, we expect housing inflation to continue decelerating and that’s going to pull core inflation down in a big way later this year and into 2024 as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-rents-598x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the rest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fed Chair Powell has cited “core services ex housing” as still being elevated. We believe it’s their way of saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, we see vehicle prices heading lower, and acknowledge the lags in housing inflation data; but we want to see the rest of it fall”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s good news on that front too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta Federal Reserve calculates something called the “Sticky Price CPI excluding food, energy, and shelter.” Simply put, it measures inflation for items whose prices typically don’t change frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, this sticky price measure was flat. Over the past 3 months it’s running at a 1.4% annual pace, well below the peak of 7.3% we saw 15 months ago. A key piece of this is restaurant food prices, which have slowed down a lot recently on the back of falling food prices. But even things like airfares, daycare and pet care services inflation have been falling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-13-sticky-price-CPI-638x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see why the June inflation report was positive from so many angles. A low reading is positive by itself, but it also confirmed what we know from other sources about what to expect going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best news is that inflation is falling, and poised to fall even further, without a rise in unemployment and an economic slowdown. A year ago, Federal Reserve officials and many economists were saying that we probably need to go into a recession for inflation to slow down, and that aggressive rate hikes by the Fed would push us into one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the unemployment rate is at 3.6%, close to 50-year lows. If real GDP growth clocks in around 2% for last quarter (as seems likely), that would mean the economy’s grown at a 2.5% pace over the past year. While inflation’s fallen from 9% to 3%. That’s huge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;NASDAQ’s Midyear Rally Ends on Friday&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/098d81db4edec466f1ab4940532e7935/ba32bd5bc8ad9f7b-b2/s540x810/367ce2de99632e9aec0e376b195125b5c3cd5e2d.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From its close on June 27 (the fourth from last trading day) through today, NASDAQ has gained 2.7% which makes this year’s NASDAQ midyear rally slightly better than average. Today’s gains were largely fueled by better than anticipated CPI reading. Provided this translates into a better-than-expected PPI report tomorrow, additional gains are likely before NASDAQ’s midyear rally officially ends on Friday, July 14. The end of the rally also coincides with the historical seasonal mid-month July market peak in pre-election years. Since 1950, the second half of July has been weaker than the first half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/619be3287d870f3ac7b6b4991b4e7073/ba32bd5bc8ad9f7b-39/s500x750/f8425b8e777ffd6c5d00551f442b733881c28980.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Inflation Expectations Still on the Decline&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of Wednesday&amp;#39;s CPI, the New York Fed&amp;#39;s Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCES) was released earlier this week and showed a continuation of the trend where consumer inflation expectations have been falling. Over the next 12 months, the Fed&amp;#39;s survey showed that the median expected rate of inflation fell from 4.07% down to 3.83%. While still above its historical average of 3.4%, consumer expectations for inflation over the next year are down to the lowest level since April 2021. Over a longer time horizon, inflation expectations haven&amp;#39;t fallen nearly as fast, but they didn&amp;#39;t rise anywhere near as much as short-term expectations either. In the June survey, the median expected rate of inflation over the next three years fell from 2.98% down to 2.95%. While that reading barely budged, we would note that current expectations for inflation over the next three years are slightly below the long-term average. Unlike the FOMC, which ditched the term transitory 18 months ago, consumers have remained on team transitory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue which has the potential to push inflation higher is how consumers expect their incomes to change over time. In this month&amp;#39;s survey, the median expected rate of earnings growth increased from 2.80% up to 2.98% which is right around the high end of its range from the last two years. As shown in the chart below, while this series has tested the 3% level multiple times, it hasn&amp;#39;t been able to bust through it. As it pertains to inflation, that&amp;#39;s a good thing, because if consumers expect their incomes to increase, they&amp;#39;re probably also less likely to push back on higher prices. At the same time, the fact that this reading has settled into a new higher range relative to its long-term average suggests that getting back down to and staying at levels of inflation that prevailed before COVID may prove to be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Small-caps Catch a Bid&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small-caps have caught a bid over the last few days with the Russell 2,000 ETF (IWM) rallying more than 3% since last Thursday&amp;#39;s close. Over the same time frame, the large-cap S&amp;amp;P 500 is up just 0.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While large-cap indices have recently traded to 52-week highs, small-caps are still well below 2023 highs made back in Q1. As shown below, though, IWM is currently attempting to break above the top end of the sideways range it has been in over the last month. If it can do that, the highs from earlier in the year will come into sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russell 2,000 (IWM) chart looks pretty interesting over a multi-year time frame. As shown below, the pre-COVID high made in early 2020 has acted as strong support over the past year. While IWM fell sharply during the mini-banking crisis this March, it stopped going down once it reached this key support level, and then it traded sideways and consolidated throughout much of April and May. Going forward, it appears that the Russell has built a strong base over the past year to springboard off of if the bull market for US equities can continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chart that always captures our attention is the one below that shows Apple&amp;#39;s (AAPL) market cap versus the combined market cap of all of the stocks in the small-cap Russell 2,000. Prior to COVID, Apple&amp;#39;s market cap wasn&amp;#39;t even close to the $2+ trillion market cap of the Russell 2,000. Since late 2021, though, the two have been battling it out. After its huge gain in Q2, Apple is currently in the lead at $2.96 trillion, but the Russell isn&amp;#39;t too far behind at $2.81 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Here We Go Again&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I’ve ever known.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Here I Go Again by Whitesnake&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons we came into 2023 overweight equities (when everyone else was talking recessions and bear markets) was the over-the-top negativity. Rarely is the crowd and obvious trade right when it comes to investing and we assumed should we get any good news, stocks could surprise to the upside. One of the most staggering signs of negativity was the median strategist in this Bloomberg survey was looking for negative stock returns in ’23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we noted in Is Anyone Bullish? (from December 11, 2022), we’d never seen strategists this bearish heading into a new year. Then layer on the fact that stocks were down close to 20% in 2022 and the odds greatly favored a big bounce back year, as stocks were rarely down two years a in a row. Not to mention, the macro backdrop was on much better footing than the M2 is crashing, LEI is down, and yield curve fearmongers were telling us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that happened was that the first six months of this year was the second best start to a year since 2000 for the S&amp;amp;P 500, best start for the NASDAQ in 40 years and the best start ever for the NASDAQ-100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where are we now? Well, similar to the great Whitesnake song in the quote above, here I go again, down the only road I’ve ever known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the only road these strategists know is doubling down on lower prices, as they expect the most bearish second half EVER. We’ll gladly take the other side to this, as we expect stocks to gain nicely the rest of this year, likely to new all-time highs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take note the other years they expected lower prices during the final six months of the year were 1999, 2019, 2020, and 2021. All the S&amp;amp;P 500 did those years was gain 7.0%, 9.8%, 21.2%, and 10.9%, respectively, over the final six months. That comes out to a very impressive 12.2% average, not bad, not bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What also has my attention? We have some big inflation data out this week, but we’ve already seen some nice signs that inflation could surprise to the downside. First up, used cars accounted for nearly a third of the jump in inflation the past few years, but it is crashing lower, with used car prices experiencing their largest monthly drop since COVID. Given light auto production is running close to pre-COVID levels, this is another sign supply chains are working again and price pressures are abating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of supply chains, the New York Fed Global Supply Chain Pressure Index did jump last month, but it was coming off of the lowest level in history. Bottom line, supply chains are back to normal after years of disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with supply chains and used car prices improving, we expect to see shelter take a big dive the second half of this year. Remember, shelter makes up more than 40% of CPI and it has stayed stubbornly high lately. Well, we’ve seen drastic improvements from private data places like Apartment List and Zillow, suggesting that the government’s data will likely follow suit soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we’ve been hearing a lot that the trillions of dollars in excess savings that consumers had over COVID was nearly all the way gone. The media are spinning this as a bearish event, as it means consumers aren’t saving anymore and they will run out of money to spend and keep the economy growing. Here’s the issue with that, the savings rate has been trending higher the past year and is more than two percent higher than it was in early 2022. The employment backdrop is still healthy, spending is solid and consumer confidence is improving. To us, all of that is positive.&lt;/p&gt;

I missed the exact bottom in October, but still - I timed it almost to perfection. So what I say next should not be dismissed with ""haha, he missed the bottom and is mad"". No bro, I am like the bottom's brother. Edit: just wanted to clarify - I was very lucky. I do not believe I am a genius who can time the market.

Jokes aside, the discount rate is at 5,25% and stocks like Microsoft trading at 40 P/E with negative EPS growth TTM. Apple is a bit better at 32. Now, I know P/E is just a smell test. But no one in this world can convince me that Microsoft will start growing EPS at such a high rate to justify such a multiple... And historically speaking, such high discount rates make P/E multiples go down and not expand. As Buffett says ""interest rates are like gravity for stocks"". Yet, the SP500 is not down even 10% from its all time high.

Microsoft is so big, it has already almost maximized its profit margin potential - it is improbable they will grow earnings over 20%/year. Another point for this being a mania.

I have to admit - there are still companies I like a lot at these prices who are still beaten down 40-50% despite being great businesses and doing well. The only reason for this is that their CEOs haven't repeated ""AIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAIAIAIAIAIIAIAIAIAIAII"" 50 times in the last earnings call. 

Where I thrive is software companies(SaaS mostly). Most of them have doubled or tripled in the last few months based on how many times AI has been repeated. Growth has slowed down, costs have staid the same, yet stock prices have skyrocketed?!?!

This tells me that this part of the market is in another maniac phase. To be clear, I haven't sold anything. It is just that the pool of potential investments that can offer great returns has decreased drastically. Investors' optimism about these stocks is making me really nervous. 

Every bit of bad news is dismissed and gets converted into good news. Every bit of good news gets exaggerated by a factor of 100. 

Even though this seems like the end stage of a bull market, I am not betting on it. See how negative I am? I am still in the market. Like Peter Lynch has said - it is important to learn to ignore your gut. Had I listened to my gut, I wouldn't have dared to enter the market in Nov 2022.

571,stocks,"A commonly followed measure of consumer confidence in the US economy just increased to the highest level since September 2021.

The first July reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index showed a reading of 72.6 on Friday. The print came in significantly higher than the 65.5 economists had expected and reflected a 13% increase from the month prior. That marks the fastest pace since December 2005, when the economy was recovering from Hurricane Katrina.

""The sharp rise in sentiment was largely attributable to the continued slowdown in inflation along with stability in labor markets,"" Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu said in the release.

Consumers have had plenty to be bullish about recently, including: A month of largely strong economic data, upbeat reports to kick-off second quarter earnings and waning fears of a second Federal Reserve rate hike in the back half of the year propelling the 2023 stock market rally higher.

A 19% surge in long-term business conditions and a 16% increase in short-run business conditions were the primary drivers behind Friday's surprise print, according to the University of Michigan. The report did, however, include a slight uptick in consumers inflation expectations.

The expectations for inflation over the next year are now at 3.4%, up from 3.3% in June but down from the highs of 5.4% in April 2022. Analysts had anticipated one-year inflation expectations to tick down to 3.1%

""Easing concerns about a recession, which had been garnering a ton of headlines in the media for most of the year, may have helped push sentiment and expectation higher,"" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet wrote on Friday.

The Friday release follows a week of upbeat economic data. On Wednesday, the Consumers Prices Index for June came in cooler than projected, rising at its slowest pace since March 2021. On Thursday, the Producer Prices Index painted a similar picture. The labor market meanwhile, continued to show resilience with weekly jobless claims of 237,000 coming in lower than expectations for 250,000 claims and below the week prior's 249,000 claims.

Last week's June jobs report showed the labor market is cooling with nonfarm payroll additions coming in short of expectations for the first time in 15 months. But economists were quick to note that the economy still added 209,000 jobs, the unemployment ticked lower to 3.6% and average hourly earnings grew 4.4% from the year prior.

At scale, that data paints a picture of a tight labor market where Americans have jobs while prices for goods continue to decrease.

\[EDIT: removed reference to a substack from the original post\]

**Tools**

Tradingview ([http://www.tradingview.com/](http://www.tradingview.com/))

* Might be the best charting tool in the game. I know a number of professional traders who use this for their personal trading and research

finviz ([https://finviz.com/](https://finviz.com/))

* Very useful stock screener and visualization tool. I often see people posting stock heat maps created with finviz on LinkedIn. 

Yahoo Finance ([https://finance.yahoo.com/](https://finance.yahoo.com/))

* Still the best free tool and database out there for basic research

SEC EDGAR ([https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/))

* the go-to place for searching through SEC filings. User interface can be better, but EDGAR is GOAT when it comes to company-level information

**Newsletters/Blogs**

Matt Levine ([https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine))

* Considered by some to be the ""Michael Jordan of financial writing"". Incredibly amusing yet insightful stuff. 

Liberty Street Economics ([https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/))

* Wonky stuff, but NY Fed has somewhat made their blog more digestible 

Professor Siegel's Weekly Commentary ([https://resources.wisdomtree.com/weekly-siegel-commentary/archive](https://resources.wisdomtree.com/weekly-siegel-commentary/archive))

* Round-up of the latest in the market. US-centric but there's enough depth to see what the market narratives are

Hedder ([http://www.hedder.com/](http://www.hedder.com/))

* Newsletters written by former hedge fund managers and traders across different verticals and asset classes

Well Fargo ([https://www.wellsfargo.com/cib/insights/economics/weekly-commentary/](https://www.wellsfargo.com/cib/insights/economics/weekly-commentary/))

* Comprehensive weekly report covering global markets. This kind of gets the job done for me since I don't have access to those by bulge brackets banks

* a great podcast where Howard Marks (Oaktree) shares his thoughts on the investment landscape.

Paul Donovan (UBS) daily audio ([https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/ubs-on-air-market-moves/id1447407862](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/ubs-on-air-market-moves/id1447407862))

581,stocks,"JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings Friday that topped analysts’ expectations as the company benefited from higher interest rates and growing interest income.

* Earnings: $4.37 per share adjusted vs. $4 per share Refinitiv estimate
* Revenue: $42.4 billion vs. $38.96 billion estimate

Net income surged 67% to $14.5 billion, or $4.75 per share. When excluding the impact of its First Republic acquisition in early May — a $2.7 billion “bargain purchase gain” from the government-brokered takeover, as well as loan reserve builds and securities losses tied to the purchase — earnings were $4.37 per share.

Revenue rose 34% to $42.4 billion as JPMorgan took advantage of higher rates and solid loan growth. Revenue gains were fueled by a 44% jump in net interest income to $21.9 billion, which topped the StreetAccount estimate by roughly $700 million. Average loans climbed 13%, while deposits fell 6%.

Shares of the bank climbed more than 2% in premarket trading.

JPMorgan has been a standout recently on several fronts. Whether it’s about deposits, funding costs or net interest income — all hot-button topics since the regional banking crisis began in March — the bank has outperformed smaller peers.

That’s helped shares of the bank climb 11% so far this year, compared with the 16% decline of the KBW Bank Index. When JPMorgan last reported results in April, its shares had their biggest earnings-day increase in two decades.

This time around, JPMorgan will have the benefit of owning First Republic after its U.S.-brokered takeover in early May.

The acquisition, which added roughly $203 billion in loans and securities and $92 billion in deposits, may help cushion JPMorgan against some of the headwinds faced by the industry. Banks are losing low-cost deposits as customers find higher-yielding places to park their cash, causing the industry’s funding costs to rise.

That’s pressuring the industry’s profit margins. Last month, several regional banks disclosed lower-than-expected interest revenue, and analysts expect more banks to do the same in coming weeks. On top of that, banks are expected to disclose a slowdown in loan growth and rising costs related to commercial real estate debt, all of which squeeze banks’ bottom lines.

Lenders have begun setting aside more loan-loss provisions on expectations for a slowing economy this year. JPMorgan is expected to post a $2.72 billion provision for credit losses, according to the StreetAccount estimate.

The bank won’t be able to sidestep downturns faced in other areas, namely, the slowdown in trading and investment banking activity. In May, JPMorgan said revenue from those Wall Street activities was headed for a 15% decline from a year earlier.

Finally, analysts will want to hear what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has to say about the health of the economy and his expectations for banking regulation and consolidation.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Especially considering our economy runs on debt and the regular ability to collect at least on the interest.

605,stocks,"I expect everyone to read this and think I am a silly bear who doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Inflation is falling, the Federal Reserve is going to hike rates once or twice this year and the US of A is saved. 

But let’s look at all the previous crashes in the markets. Things never looked bad, in fact they always looked good. Until something in the financial engineering of the world, broke. 

I won’t go over all the “stock market crashes” but we know this to be the case. In the unprecedented world we live in, after the covid crisis so much has happened. So much in fact that a lot of it we don’t know about, and some of the stuff we know about we don’t know what the true intentions of them were like all the investigations by the SEC or the changes to the capital equity markets etc. 

Now we are in a place where to a retail investor the market looks ripe for investing. Inflation is coming down, the Federal Reserve will hopefully only hike once again this year. Though BofA still expects two rate hikes. 

But is it so simple? Inflation is as the market would say “old news”, “priced in” we know about it. We knew it would fall, and the only real reaction. we would have gotten is if it was rising again. None of this is a surprise. All of this is priced into every model on Wall Street. 

Let’s also keep in mind; Inflation has been moderating recently, but the decrease is largely due to outsized jumps in prices last year, which are rolling off year-ago comparisons. Therefore, the surge in inflation last year was followed by a lull, but inflation is likely to re-accelerate toward the end of the summer.

The US labor market remains resilient, giving the Federal Reserve reason to maintain tight monetary policy. Making it even more likely the Fed will hike rates twice more this year which is one time more than the market currently expects. 

What is happening in the markets? The correlations? What are they telling us about what happens next? 

Inflation in the goods sector has dropped, but the slowdown in orders and reduction in backlogs are affecting employment in the sector.

The US factory sector has continued to slow down, with only four of eighteen industries reporting growth in June. This suggests the goods sector may lead the way into a recession.

Energy and food prices rose in June, contributing to inflation. Housing rents, a major contributor to high inflation, are still rising.

Core inflation, excluding food, energy, and housing rents, remained unchanged in June, showing the lowest monthly reading in nearly two years.

The ISM Manufacturing index has remained in contraction territory for eight consecutive months, indicating a slowdown in the goods sector of the economy.

The trade deficit in goods and services has declined, indicating weakening demand for goods domestically and a trend toward spending on services.

We’re looking at a US Dollar hitting its 15 month lows. The Nasdaq is going to have to perform a “special rebalancing” because the so-called “magnificent seven” are so overvalued that they’re starting to create too much risk for the Nasdaq. 

Behind the scenes of all this “inflation talk” we are still seeing tighter lending and regional banks are struggling again. As per the FED Beige Book released yesterday, July 12, 2023. People are also defaulting on their car payments, and this is before the Student Loan Payments come back in full effect. 

BofA reported today that total card spending per household by their aggregates credit and debit cards is down 2% YoY. This softness is consistent with the slowdown in non-farm payrolls. They state “The latest data flow pushes back against the notion that the economy re-accelerated significantly in 2Q after the soft patch in March. Instead, we appear to be in a period of below trend economic growth and consumer spending.”

China also today, declared that both their imports and exports growth fell below consensus. June exports contracted further by 12.4% YoY vs the -7.5% previously announced. Import growth also softened to -6.8% from the -4.5% in May. Export growth was weaker “across the board”. 

On top of that, despite all of the inflation data we have received, there has been absolutely no deviation from any Fed Speaker even some who are usually quite dovish. We remain with the “higher-for-longer” message, along with the Federal Reserve expectation of 2 more rate hikes this year and rate cuts further away than the market has priced in, according to Jerome Powell. Note the second rate hike has not been priced in to the market, despite not one Fed Speaker deviating from that message. 

The market euphoria is creating an inefficiency which will eventually be taken advantage of. As Sun Tzu states, defeat is not brought by yourself, but it is brought on by the enemy. Anyone buying this market is bringing themselves to be defeated because the underlying picture is much more grimy than the media, Joe Biden and his aides, or your friends who also own shares of that “wonderful AI stock” would tell you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect everyone to read this and think I am a silly bear who doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

&lt;p&gt;Let’s also keep in mind; Inflation has been moderating recently, but the decrease is largely due to outsized jumps in prices last year, which are rolling off year-ago comparisons. Therefore, the surge in inflation last year was followed by a lull, but inflation is likely to re-accelerate toward the end of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US labor market remains resilient, giving the Federal Reserve reason to maintain tight monetary policy. Making it even more likely the Fed will hike rates twice more this year which is one time more than the market currently expects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is happening in the markets? The correlations? What are they telling us about what happens next? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation in the goods sector has dropped, but the slowdown in orders and reduction in backlogs are affecting employment in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US factory sector has continued to slow down, with only four of eighteen industries reporting growth in June. This suggests the goods sector may lead the way into a recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy and food prices rose in June, contributing to inflation. Housing rents, a major contributor to high inflation, are still rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Core inflation, excluding food, energy, and housing rents, remained unchanged in June, showing the lowest monthly reading in nearly two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISM Manufacturing index has remained in contraction territory for eight consecutive months, indicating a slowdown in the goods sector of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trade deficit in goods and services has declined, indicating weakening demand for goods domestically and a trend toward spending on services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking at a US Dollar hitting its 15 month lows. The Nasdaq is going to have to perform a “special rebalancing” because the so-called “magnificent seven” are so overvalued that they’re starting to create too much risk for the Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes of all this “inflation talk” we are still seeing tighter lending and regional banks are struggling again. As per the FED Beige Book released yesterday, July 12, 2023. People are also defaulting on their car payments, and this is before the Student Loan Payments come back in full effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BofA reported today that total card spending per household by their aggregates credit and debit cards is down 2% YoY. This softness is consistent with the slowdown in non-farm payrolls. They state “The latest data flow pushes back against the notion that the economy re-accelerated significantly in 2Q after the soft patch in March. Instead, we appear to be in a period of below trend economic growth and consumer spending.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also today, declared that both their imports and exports growth fell below consensus. June exports contracted further by 12.4% YoY vs the -7.5% previously announced. Import growth also softened to -6.8% from the -4.5% in May. Export growth was weaker “across the board”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, despite all of the inflation data we have received, there has been absolutely no deviation from any Fed Speaker even some who are usually quite dovish. We remain with the “higher-for-longer” message, along with the Federal Reserve expectation of 2 more rate hikes this year and rate cuts further away than the market has priced in, according to Jerome Powell. Note the second rate hike has not been priced in to the market, despite not one Fed Speaker deviating from that message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market euphoria is creating an inefficiency which will eventually be taken advantage of. As Sun Tzu states, defeat is not brought by yourself, but it is brought on by the enemy. Anyone buying this market is bringing themselves to be defeated because the underlying picture is much more grimy than the media, Joe Biden and his aides, or your friends who also own shares of that “wonderful AI stock” would tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

Disney CEO Bob Iger opened the door to selling the company’s linear TV assets as the business struggles during the media industry’s transition to streaming and digital offerings. Iger appeared on CNBC on Thursday, the morning after the company announced it would extend his contract by two years through 2026. He returned to the helm of the company in November after Disney’s board ousted Bob Chapek with a two-year contract through 2024 and plans to find a next successor. “After coming back, I realized the company is facing a lot of challenges, some of them self inflicted,” Iger told CNBC’s Faber on Thursday, noting he’s accomplished a lot of work in seven months but there’s more to be done.

At the top of the list is assessing the traditional TV business, Iger said on Thursday. Disney owns a portfolio of TV networks, from broadcast station ABC to cable-TV channels like ESPN.  Disney is going to be “expansive” in its thinking about the traditional TV business, leaving the door open to a possible sale of the networks. “They may not be core to Disney,” Iger said, adding the creativity that has come from those networks has been key for Disney.  Cable-TV channel ESPN is in a different bucket, however. On that front, Iger said Disney is open to finding a strategic partner, which could take the form of a joint venture or offloading an ownership stake. 

Iger said when he had left the company he had predicted the future of traditional TV and had been “very pessimistic,” and has found since his return that he was right in his thinking, adding it’s worse than he expected. When Iger last spoke with Faber in February, soon after announcing a major restructuring at the company, he said he felt “a sense of obligation” to return to Disney and that his preference was to stay for his two-year contract. “We’ve gotten a lot done very quickly, significant cost reductions and significant realignment of the company,” Iger said. “But dealing head on with some of our biggest challenges.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/disney-ceo-iger-opens-door-to-unloading-tv-assets.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/disney-ceo-iger-opens-door-to-unloading-tv-assets.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Thursday after the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level in over a year. Markets also looked ahead to another key inflation reading.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4%, while Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.7%. Futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 75 points, or about 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Disney shares added more than 1% after the entertainment giant extended CEO Bob Iger’s contract through 2026, two years longer than planned.
*****
&gt; Stocks surged Wednesday after a cooler-than-expected June consumer price index report eased some worries that the Federal Reserve may tip the economy into a recession as it fights to bring down sticky inflation.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.74% and 1.15%, respectively, to hit their highest closing levels since April 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 86.01 points, or 0.25%.
*****
&gt; Fundstrat’s Tom Lee told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday that today’s CPI print, future expectations for easing and recent stock activity paint a market that is “behaving more like a soft landing” scenario that many deemed unreachable at the start of 2023.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed has to sort of start to accept that this is indeed a breakdown of inflationary pressures, and so, they may potentially then reduce their notion of higher for longer, or the market begins to price it in,” he said. “That’s not a guarantee, but again, we believe that’s the case.”
*****
&gt; Investor attention turns toward the producer price index, another key inflation gauge due out Thursday. The results could heavily influence future central bank interest rate hikes and decipher the road ahead for inflation.

&gt; After a pause in June, traders are pricing in a more than 92% chance of that the central bank hikes rates at its policy meeting later this month, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.

614,stocks,"I am always curious how ""big events"" impact the value of public companies. This is one of the biggest subreddits and I'd like to hear your thoughts on the latest press release of Domino's.

&amp;#x200B;

Domino's Pizza has been delivering its pizza directly through its app. The company entered into a new global agreement with Uber, allowing customers to place orders via Uber Eats and Postmates, with the delivery being done by Domino's drivers.

The question that should be addressed is, ""What does this mean for the two companies, and how do they benefit from this partnership?""

Based on the press release,  Uber One, and Postmates Unlimited members will receive delivery with **no charge** on their Domino's orders within the Uber Eats and Postmates platforms.

**However, this isn't free**. Uber is a company that makes money from the **fees** it charges for its services. The question is, who bears these costs:

1. Customer bears the costs - The demand for Domino's products could decrease (quantity-wise) due to the higher price. However, this depends on the elasticity of the demand, which isn't known yet. Of course, if the customer has an unlimited membership, it is clear that the cost is either by Uber or Domino's.
2. If Uber bears the cost (By not charging the fee) - It might add value in the form of more customers, but not in additional revenue. This would bring additional revenue to Domino's. It might seem as a win-win scenario, but it is not sustainable, Uber cannot afford to have a business model of this kind for a long period of time with all of its partners (and historically, that wasn't the case)
3. If Domino's bears the cost - This will lead to higher revenue, but lower margins.

After this news, Domino's share price went up over 11%, while Uber's didn't change at all. 

It is not surprising that Uber's share price didn't change, as the additional revenue doesn't represent a significant increase when compared to the total revenue it earns.

624,stocks,"Nasdaq announced late last week that the Nasdaq 100 _ will undergo a special rebalancing that will take effect prior to the market open on July 24. It’s only the third time that Nasdaq has announced such an impromptu rejiggering of how much individual stocks contribute to the index. Although Nasdaq can also reconstitute the index regularly every December, and there’s also a mechanism to rebalance every quarter as well.
In a statement announcing the move, the exchange alluded to the fact that the largest companies in the technology sector have too much sway over the index’s price. Nasdaq said special rebalancing can be implemented “to address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.”
The rebalancing comes at a critical time. The Nasdaq 100 has risen 40% since the start of 2023, largely thanks to the “Magnificent Seven,” a handful of megacap technology names that have powered much of the U.S. stock market’s rally this year.
These gains have pushed the index to its highest level since mid-January 2022, meaning that Big Tech has now retraced nearly all of last year’s losses, and might soon be headed for the all-time highs from November 2021.
As of Thursday, the Magnificent Seven stocks — Nvidia  Corp. _, Apple Inc. _, Microsoft Corp. _, Amazon.com Inc. _, Tesla Inc. _, Meta Platforms Inc. _ and Alphabet Inc.’s Class A _ and Class C _ shares  — accounted for 55% of the Nasdaq 100’s market capitalization, while the top five names account for more than 45%.
According to Nasdaq’s official methodology, the goal is to keep the aggregate weighting of the biggest stocks below 40%. In fact, it’s possible that Tesla Inc. surpassing 4.5% of the index earlier this month triggered the Nasdaq’s rebalancing announcement, according to analysts from UBS Group AG _.
Exactly how it plans to accomplish this isn’t yet known. Nasdaq said the new weighting scheme will be unveiled on Friday, likely after the U.S. market close. But the UBS team has an educated guess.
The quarterly reviews would dictate that the aggregate weight to securities exceeding 4.5% be set to 40%. If that’s the approach Nasdaq takes, then we’d expect the weights of Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla to be reduced,” the team said in a note shared with MarketWatch","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq announced late last week that the Nasdaq 100 _ will undergo a special rebalancing that will take effect prior to the market open on July 24.

I was wondering in your opinion how much earnings estimates are actually priced in to the markets.

According to FactSet:

\- Earnings Decline: For Q2 2023, the estimated earnings decline for the S&amp;P 500 is -7.2%. If -7.2% is the actual decline for the quarter, it will mark the largest earnings decline reported by the index since Q2 2020 (-31.6%).

\- Valuation: The forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 18.9. This P/E ratio is above the 5-year average(18.6) and above the 10-year average (17.4).

Furthermore:

\-As of today, 113 S&amp;P 500 companies have issued EPS guidance for the second quarter. This number is above the 5-year average of 96 and above the 10-year average of 98.

\-Of these companies, 67 have issued negative EPS guidance and 46 have issued positive EPS guidance. The number of companies issuing negative EPS guidance is above the 5-year average of 57 and above the 10-year average of 63. The number of companies issuing positive EPS guidance is also above the 5-year average of 40 and above the 10-year average of 35.

\-While the number of S&amp;P 500 companies issuing negative EPS guidance for Q2 is consistent with the numbers in three of the past four quarters, the number of S&amp;P 500 companies issuing positive EPS guidance for Q2 is well above the numbers of the past few quarters.

Finally:

\-In fact, the second quarter has seen the highest number of S&amp;P 500 companies issuing positive EPS guidance for a quarter since Q3 2021 (56).

\-At the sector level, the Information Technology and Industrials sectors have the highest number of companies issuing positive EPS guidance for the second quarter at 20 and 9, respectively. Combined, these two sectors account for more than half (29) of all the companies in the S&amp;P 500 issuing positive EPS guidance for the second quarter (46)

Just looking at some of these data points gives me cause for concern, especially with the amount of positive EPS guidance for tech and Sp500 stocks after the big run-up during the past few months. It seems that there seems to be some divergence with this positive guidance and the negative projected earnings decline for Sp500 for Q2 2023.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else feel that volatility from inflation data moving markets has gotten less significant over time and the markets are actually more worried about 2023 Q2 earnings than inflation?

636,stocks,"In June, further strides were made in the ongoing battle against inflation. However, these developments do not necessarily alter the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate hike later this month. Consumer prices recorded a 0.2% increase in June, falling below the expected consensus of 0.3% and bringing the twelve-month change down to 3.0%. While this might suggest a recent rapid moderation in inflation, a closer analysis reveals that this is primarily attributed to the outsized price jumps witnessed last year. 

Notably, the inflation rates of 0.9% in May 2022 and 1.2% in June 2022, which are now rolling off the year-on-year comparisons. As history has shown, a surge in inflation is often followed by a period of minimal movement, as observed in July and August 2022. Consequently, it is likely that the twelve-month inflation readings will re-accelerate towards the end of the summer.

When combined with the resilience of the US labor market, these factors provide a compelling rationale for Powell and the Federal Reserve to maintain a tight monetary policy in the months ahead. A closer examination of the latest report reveals that energy and food prices both rose in June. After excluding these components, “core” prices mirrored the 0.2% overall increase, while the twelve-month comparison declined to 4.8%. Once again, housing rents emerged as the primary driver within the core categories, rising by 0.5% in June. Although rental inflation has moderated since the rapid pace observed in the second half of 2022, both actual tenant rents and the imputed rental value of owner-occupied homes continue to grow at or above a 6% annualized rate across three-, six-, and twelve-month timeframes. These figures are noteworthy, as they contribute to one-third of the overall index weighting and have been significant contributors to the persistently high inflation experienced over the past two years. Going forward, we anticipate rents continuing to generate inflation as they catch up with the soaring home prices witnessed in 2020-21.

Several categories experienced declines in June, exerting downward pressure on core inflation. Airfare (-8.1%), hotels &amp; motels (-2.3%), and used vehicles (-0.5%) were among the contributing factors. Meanwhile, a subset category closely monitored by the Federal Reserve, known as the “Super Core,” which excludes food, energy, other goods, and housing rents, remained unchanged in June, marking its lowest monthly reading in nearly two years. Over the past twelve months, prices within the Super Core category have increased by 3.9%. The moderation in inflation this year can be attributed to the deceleration of money supply growth, which had surged in 2020-21. The M2 measure of money is currently down 4.0% compared to a year ago. Although it remains to be seen whether this trend will persist, if it does, it could eventually bring inflation back in line with the Federal Reserve’s target of 2.0%. At present, the Federal Reserve has made some headway in its fight against inflation, but it is essential to acknowledge that the battle is far from over.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, further strides were made in the ongoing battle against inflation.

While I think the underlying business of Google is incredibly good, I have the feeling that it moat is getting smaller. I expect growth from its cloud services, YouTube, and maybe some of Google bets might play out (Pixel phones, robotaxies, chromebooks if they stop sucking...) , but we all know that the most profitable part of Google business is its search engine.

Know, while Microsoft might try to eat Googles pie and is probably its main competitor over most segments, especially Bing/Chatgpt vs Chrome/Bard, Outlook vs Gmail, M.Teams vs G.meet and so on, I think the biggest treat is actually Apple.

Right know Google is paying a big undisclosed amount (probably around 20 bln $ a year ) to be the default search engine on Apple devices, where a lot of Google searches (from the most valuable well off users) come from. The idea that Apple could raise the price of the deal by a lot or start promoting its own search engine is quite terrifing. It would be a risky move for them (losing 10s of blns a year for doing effectively nothing, and coming up with a search engine on their own that gives satisfactory results) but given Apples pivot toward services and its insane customer loyalty it might not be that crazy after all.

Android has a biggest market share, but these people have a lower capacity/willingness to spend, so it doesn't really matters that much. If I had to rate Google search traffic, I would say that the one coming from Android users is the safest (and probably the least profitable), the one coming from Windows PC is still relatively safe (despite bing being default and intagrated with Chatgpt), and the one coming from iOS is the one most at risk, and unfortunately for Google the most profitable.

It would be a risky move for them (losing 10s of blns a year for doing effectively nothing, and coming up with a search engine on their own that gives satisfactory results) but given Apples pivot toward services and its insane customer loyalty it might not be that crazy after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android has a biggest market share, but these people have a lower capacity/willingness to spend, so it doesn&amp;#39;t really matters that much. If I had to rate Google search traffic, I would say that the one coming from Android users is the safest (and probably the least profitable), the one coming from Windows PC is still relatively safe (despite bing being default and intagrated with Chatgpt), and the one coming from iOS is the one most at risk, and unfortunately for Google the most profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article summarizes some of my concerns quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An article I just read put it quite well IMO&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=""https://macdailynews.com/2023/02/21/google-pays-apple-20-billion-annually-to-be-safaris-default-search-engine/#:%7E:text=Google%2Dparent%20Alphabet%20pays%20Apple,writes%20for%20The%20Motley%20Fool""&gt;https://macdailynews.com/2023/02/21/google-pays-apple-20-billion-annually-to-be-safaris-default-search-engine/#:~:text=Google%2Dparent%20Alphabet%20pays%20Apple,writes%20for%20The%20Motley%20Fool&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

# [Stock futures are little changed as Wall Street awaits major inflation report: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were slightly higher Wednesday morning as investors looked toward the first potentially pivotal inflation report slated for release this week.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 futures gained 46 points and 0.2%, respectively. Nasdaq-100 futures also climbed 0.2%
*****
&gt; Investors are eyeing the June consumer price index reading due before the bell Wednesday. Economists polled by Dow Jones anticipate the closely followed inflation indicator will rise 0.3% from May and 3.1% on an annualized basis. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the so-called core CPI is forecasted to increase 0.3% on the month and 5% on the year.
*****
&gt; June data for the producer price index — another well-watched gauge of inflation — is due Thursday before the bell. Both price indexes are being watched for tea leaves on the path of inflation, which investors see as potential harbingers for how the Federal Reserve will move interest rates going forward. The market is pricing in an approximately 92% chance the Fed raises interest rates at the July meeting, according to CME’s FedWatch Tool.
*****
&gt; “Investors are looking ahead to tomorrow’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers, which could show that inflation is continuing to cool,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer of the Independent Advisor Alliance. “But if it shows that inflation is remaining persistent, ... that’s likely to force the Fed’s hand.”
*****
&gt; Stocks finished higher in Tuesday’s session. The Dow finished more than 300 points higher, equating to a gain of about 0.9%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite advanced nearly 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, investors will monitor comments from central bank officials including Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester throughout Wednesday for any insights into the state of U.S. economic policy.

652,stocks,"Warren Buffett is one of the World's most successful investors (with a net worth of over $100 Billion), and has shared his investing wisdom through his annual letters. Here are 7 key lessons from Buffett that can help you become a better investor:  
1) MOATs:  
A moat is an economic advantage that a company has over its competitors. It can be anything from a strong brand name to a patent.  
Moats are important because they protect companies from competition and allow them to earn higher profits.  
2) What you own matters so focus on businesses:  
Buffett focuses on businesses with great management and economic advantages.   
He calls himself a ""business picker,"" not a ""stock picker.""  
3) Market pricing is irrelevant in the long term:  
Buffett says that a stock price shouldn't determine whether you buy or sell.  
In the short term, people vote with their dollars on which stocks will do well.  
But in the long term, stocks with the most value tend to do well, regardless of their price.  
4) Adopt a patient investment approach:  
Buffett says that ""for investors as a whole, returns decrease as motions increase.""  
This means that the more you trade, the less money you're likely to make. The best investors are the ones who buy and hold for the long term.  
5) Time is a friend of great businesses, but an enemy of the mediocre:  
Great businesses tend to get better over time, while mediocre businesses tend to get worse.   
This is why it's important to invest in great businesses and hold them for the long term.  
6) Be greedy when others are fearful:  
When the market is down, that's when you should be buying.  
This is because great businesses are often on sale when everyone else is panicking.  
7) Rebalance your portfolio, but don't sell your winners:  
Rebalancing your portfolio is important, but you don't want to sell your winners just because they've gotten too big.  
Instead, you should sell your losers and use the proceeds to buy more of your winners.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett is one of the World&amp;#39;s most successful investors (with a net worth of over $100 Billion), and has shared his investing wisdom through his annual letters.

656,stocks,"I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly.

I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation.  I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120...

Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. **On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000.** I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day.

On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. **Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD**.  I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate.

I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day.

**===============================Update on 7/12/2023 =======================**

**1)**  To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** To answer the question about why I hold these stocks:

**UPST**

Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens.

Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy.

Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20% 

&amp;#x200B;

**SOFI**

I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because ""personal loans are risky"", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s. 

Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI.

Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank.

&amp;#x200B;

**IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE**

**ZS, CRWD** are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison:

Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s)

Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s)

Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability.

That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector.

I own **NET** even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET

**IOT** is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily.

**BILL** is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated.

**GLBE** is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE

Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium.

&amp;#x200B;

**Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS**

**TMDX**: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. 

Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession.

**HIMS**: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me.

Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector.

&amp;#x200B;

**MELI**

A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company.

**DIS**

I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs

**OPEN**

I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account ""operdoor2"" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data.

&amp;#x200B;

Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: **TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN**

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover.

I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss.  Just to give a few examples:

I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green.

Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS.

Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. 

Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back.

Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44.

Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)  

So in short, swing trade and rebalancing  (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far.  Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t believe that things can turn around so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation.  I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. &lt;strong&gt;On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000.&lt;/strong&gt; I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. &lt;strong&gt;Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD&lt;/strong&gt;.  I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don&amp;#39;t loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===============================Update on 7/12/2023 =======================&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt;  To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don&amp;#39;t even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; To answer the question about why I hold these stocks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20% &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOFI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because &amp;quot;personal loans are risky&amp;quot;, I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts&amp;#39;  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZS, CRWD&lt;/strong&gt; are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I own &lt;strong&gt;NET&lt;/strong&gt; even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IOT&lt;/strong&gt; is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BILL&lt;/strong&gt; is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLBE&lt;/strong&gt; is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don&amp;#39;t know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMDX&lt;/strong&gt;: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX&amp;#39;s device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIMS&lt;/strong&gt;: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MELI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs&amp;#39; coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account &amp;quot;operdoor2&amp;quot; has OPEN&amp;#39;s real time sales and margin data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: &lt;strong&gt;TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss.  Just to give a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don&amp;#39;t think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back.&lt;/p&gt;

If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB&amp;#39;s last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks&amp;#39; ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, swing trade and rebalancing  (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far.  Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

Every thing online says forward p/e should decrease when forward EPS increases. 

Is the forward EPS not increasing *enough* to lower the forward P/E? That’s the only thing I can think of to explain it. Finviz link is below. 

To abide by the community rules I do own a few shares but it’s a very small percentage of my portfolio.

2nd Edit: Adding what I said in a comment since I think this is likely either the answer or going down the right path. 

I compared the finviz numbers to TIKR and TIKR has the EPS estimates as decreasing in 2023 but going back to 2022 numbers in 2024.

So I think the 12.66% EPS increase in Finviz (which was causing the confusion) is for 2023 to 24 (increasing next year after a decline in EPS this year.)

And the ttm vs forward EPS from Finviz is 2022 vs 2023. So yes, EPS is declining this year but expected to increase again in 2024.

A federal judge in San Francisco has denied the Federal Trade Commission’s motion for a preliminary injunction to stop Microsoft from completing acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard.  
  
“This Court’s responsibility in this case is narrow. It is to decide if, notwithstanding these current circumstances, the merger should be halted—perhaps even terminated—pending resolution of the FTC administrative action,” Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley wrote in her decision, published on Tuesday. “For the reasons explained, the Court finds the FTC has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim this particular vertical merger in this specific industry may substantially lessen competition. To the contrary, the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content. The motion for a preliminary injunction is therefore DENIED.”  
  
The decision comes after five days of court hearings to assess whether Microsoft  
 would be able to complete the $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard  
 acquisition it announced in 2022. The judge was deciding whether to grant the FTC’s request for an emergency injunction to prevent the deal from closing.  
  
The FTC argued Microsoft has shown an interest in making some games exclusive, to prevent them from appearing on Sony’s PlayStation or Nintendo’s Switch, and might do that if the deal were to close, while Microsoft said they would want to make Activision’s title more available, not less, partly to grow from people subscribing to its Game Pass library of games. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick both testified, as did executives from Alphabet, Nvidia and Sony.  
  
In December the Federal Trade Commission filed suit to block the deal and have an administrative law judge at the agency assess it. But in June, before that could happen, the FTC requested a preliminary injunction to prevent Microsoft from completing the acquisition, with an eye toward bringing the case to its administrative law judge on Aug. 2. The two companies were looking to close the deal by July 18.

671,stocks,"Nvidia Corp. is benefiting from “robust demand” for artificial-intelligence servers across the board, and that could help extend the stock’s stunning rally, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets.

KeyBanc analyst John Vinh upped his price target on shares of Nvidia NVDA, -0.76% to $550 from $500 late Monday, with his new target among the highest on Wall Street: Above Vinh’s $550 target were one $767 target price and two $600 target prices, according to FactSet. C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI matched Vinh at $550.

Shares closed Monday at $421.80, and they’re up 189% so far this year.

Vinh’s heightened optimism about Nvidia’s prospects comes after he conducted channel checks in Asia. Those indicated strong interest in AI servers that are “not only coming from cloud but also enterprise and from AI startups,” he wrote in a note to clients.

Additionally, he said he sees the potential for Nvidia to benefit from delays related to an Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +0.36% product.

“Delays associated with AMD’s MI300 are likely to free up incremental capacity in 2H23, while we believe NVDA has secured enough capacity (CoWoS) to quadruple its datacenter revenues in 2024,” Vinh wrote, referring to chip-on-wafer-on-substrate, a type of packaging.


That said, Vinh also boosted his price target on shares of AMD, despite more “mixed” channel checks there, compared with the “positive” ones for Nvidia.

“While near-term challenges associated with delays of its MI300 AI server and stability issues with its PC NB Ryzen Phoenix (7040) could result in near-term risk to estimates, AI server wins at HP/El Capitan, MSFT, and Meta give us high conviction that AMD could see well over $2B in AI revenues in 2024,” Vinh wrote, as he lifted his price target on the shares to $160 from $150.

Chip companies will begin reporting earnings in the coming weeks, and one trend to watch will be how server demand is playing out more broadly. “AI servers [are] seeing outsized demand but appear to be cannibalizing traditional server,” Vihn wrote in his note to clients.

He also flagged overall weakness in China, “with no signs of a recovery, which is limiting the inventory destocking process.”

# [Stock futures are little changed as traders look ahead to key inflation data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/10/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were little changed Tuesday, after the major averages snapped a three-day decline, as traders await key inflation data slated for release later in the week.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures dipped slightly, while Nasdaq-100 futures nudged higher by just 0.05%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 57 points, or 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Investors are coming off a positive session for the major averages. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 209.52 points, or 0.62%, while the S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.24%. The Nasdaq Composite lagged, rising just 0.18%.
*****
&gt; The June consumer price index report set for release Wednesday, as well as the June producer price index due out Thursday, will shed light on whether the decline in inflation has continued, and create the backdrop for future direction of interest rates.
*****
&gt; Investors have penciled in another quarter-point increase at the Federal Reserve’s July 25-26 meeting. But they are undecided about what the central bank will do at its September meeting after last week’s continued robust jobs data raised concern that policymakers will revert to raising rates following the June pause.
*****
&gt; “The pause, agree or disagree, is to gather more information,” Solus Alternative Asset Management’s Dan Greenhaus said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” He added, “One more hike or two more hikes is much less important than when, ultimately, they begin to cut rates on the other side of this. That’s much more consequential for, I think, the risk landscape than one more hike or two more hikes.”
*****
&gt; On the economic front, June’s NFIB Small Business Index, a measure of business confidence, is set for release Tuesday before the bell. Economists polled by Dow Jones are anticipating a reading of 90.0, slightly higher than the 89.4 level in May.
*****
&gt; Second-quarter earnings season kicks off later this week with results from “systemically important financial institutions” such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, plus BlackRock, PepsiCo and Delta Air. Dow component UnitedHealth reports Friday.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, July 11th, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Tuesday, July the 11th, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/10/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures are little changed as traders look ahead to key inflation data: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures were little changed Tuesday, after the major averages snapped a three-day decline, as traders await key inflation data slated for release later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 futures dipped slightly, while Nasdaq-100 futures nudged higher by just 0.05%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 57 points, or 0.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are coming off a positive session for the major averages. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 209.52 points, or 0.62%, while the S&amp;amp;P 500 advanced 0.24%. The Nasdaq Composite lagged, rising just 0.18%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The June consumer price index report set for release Wednesday, as well as the June producer price index due out Thursday, will shed light on whether the decline in inflation has continued, and create the backdrop for future direction of interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors have penciled in another quarter-point increase at the Federal Reserve’s July 25-26 meeting. But they are undecided about what the central bank will do at its September meeting after last week’s continued robust jobs data raised concern that policymakers will revert to raising rates following the June pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The pause, agree or disagree, is to gather more information,” Solus Alternative Asset Management’s Dan Greenhaus said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” He added, “One more hike or two more hikes is much less important than when, ultimately, they begin to cut rates on the other side of this. That’s much more consequential for, I think, the risk landscape than one more hike or two more hikes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the economic front, June’s NFIB Small Business Index, a measure of business confidence, is set for release Tuesday before the bell. Economists polled by Dow Jones are anticipating a reading of 90.0, slightly higher than the 89.4 level in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter earnings season kicks off later this week with results from “systemically important financial institutions” such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, plus BlackRock, PepsiCo and Delta Air. Dow component UnitedHealth reports Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the ""magnificent seven"" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.

The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.

The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to ""address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.""

The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.

The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.


How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted?
The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.

The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.

The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.

Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.

Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.

Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.

Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.

Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.

How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut?
Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.

Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.

The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.

Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023
The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.

This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.

There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.

Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices?
The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.

However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&amp;P 500, which is why S&amp;P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.

The S&amp;P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.

Most of the ""magnificent 7"" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.

The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.

687,stocks,"In the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, the US Federal Reserve operated under a “scarce reserve” monetary policy, which fostered an active marketplace where banks engaged in federal funds trading. However, since the introduction of Quantitative Easing following the crisis, the monetary landscape has undergone a significant transformation. The flood of reserves into the system has severed the direct link between interest rates and the money supply. In this article, we examine the implications of this shift and its impact on market expectations and stock valuations.

Previously, the federal funds rate was determined by an active marketplace of lending and borrowing reserves among banks. This system maintained a direct connection between the money supply and interest rates. However, the Federal Reserve’s response to the 2008 financial panic, through Quantitative Easing, led to an abundance of reserves in the system. Consequently, banks no longer borrow or lend these reserves; instead, the Fed pays them to hold them. This change has severed the direct link between interest rates and the money supply.

Under the current system, the Federal Reserve has the sole authority to set interest rates, resulting in market expectations being heavily influenced by speculation about the Fed’s next moves. Every economic data point now carries weight as investors try to anticipate the Fed’s decisions. Earlier this year, the market priced in multiple rate cuts for the second half of 2023. However, after a robust employment report indicating solid job growth, the odds of a July rate hike surged to almost 90%. We believe the market is underestimating the likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising short-term rates beyond July.

The Federal Reserve closely monitors the labor market and average hourly earnings. Recent reports have shown stronger economic performance than anticipated, accompanied by persistently high global inflation rates. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in June and are up 4.4% from a year ago. Despite the Fed’s focus on the labor market due to its models, we argue that the central bank should consider actual inflation and the money supply. Given a 2.0% inflation target and slow productivity growth, the Fed would prefer to see average hourly earnings grow closer to a 3% annual rate rather than the current 4.4%.

The low unemployment rate, which currently stands at 3.6%, compared to the Fed’s projection of 4.1% for the fourth quarter, further strengthens the case for an aggressive stance by the central bank. At its June meeting, twelve out of eighteen Fed policymakers believed that rates would increase at least two more times in 2023. This suggests that unless economic and inflation data significantly deviate from expectations, only one rate hike is unlikely for the remainder of the year. This scenario raises concerns about overvalued equities.

If the Federal Reserve ends up raising rates more aggressively than anticipated, long-term interest rates could face upward pressure in the coming months. Our Capitalized Profits model, which evaluates the fair value of the S&amp;P 500 index based on nationwide profits and the 10-year US Treasury yield, suggests that the index is fairly valued at around 3,350 with a 4.00% 10-year yield. A higher yield would drive the measure of fair value even lower.

We have been monitoring the M2 measure of the money supply, which has experienced its most significant decline since the Great Depression. Although the US economy is still absorbing the effects of the massive money printing during the COVID-19 pandemic, this trend is expected to taper off soon. A decline in M2 is likely to push the economy into a recession in the near future.

Investors currently seem unworried about a potential recession, assuming the Federal Reserve will implement rate cuts to counteract any downturn. However, our model suggests that even with a 3.00% 10-year yield, a 15% decline in profits would significantly impact the fair value of the S&amp;P 500, reducing it to just 3,800. The optimism surrounding a “Goldilocks” scenario, where the Fed perfectly manages all factors, may be too idealistic. In light of this, adopting more defensive strategies may be prudent at this juncture, considering the possibility of overvalued stock prices.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, the US Federal Reserve operated under a “scarce reserve” monetary policy, which fostered an active marketplace where banks engaged in federal funds trading.

691,stocks,"Graphics card prices in the semiconductor industry have been on the decline for almost a year, and Nvidia, one of the leading players in the semiconductor industry, has felt the impact. The company’s RTX 4060 and RTX 4080 models have experienced price drops. This development serves as a reminder that even industry giants like Nvidia face intense competition in the semiconductor market, making investments in the company potentially volatile.

Today Forbes reported a significant decrease in the prices of Nvidia’s RTX 4060, with the card dropping by as much as six percent within just a week of its launch. 

Include the tepid reception from reviewers, and this isn’t a good start for Nvidia’s latest launch. This has resulted in customers gravitating towards older graphics cards from both AMD and Nvidia themselves, particularly those not heavily reliant on ray tracing or DLSS technologies.

The situation becomes more apparent with the RTX 4080, as the graphics card’s experienced a price drop in Europe, and a 17 percent reduction in the US market from $1,199 to $999 was the most significant change. 

These price drops and market dynamics highlight the highly competitive nature of the semiconductor industry. Nvidia’s position as a dominant player does not shield it from the pressures of a rapidly evolving market. The recent pricing pressure also suggests potential challenges in terms of demand and competition, which may impact the company’s financial performance and stock value.

Investing in Nvidia should be approached with caution, considering the inherent volatility in the semiconductor industry. While Nvidia has demonstrated its ability to adapt and innovate in the past, the market landscape is constantly shifting. The recent price drops serve as a stark reminder that even established players must navigate fierce competition and changing consumer preferences.

It is crucial to keep a watchful eye on Nvidia’s future product releases, market trends, and financial performance. These factors will shape the company’s ability to maintain its competitive edge and provide a clearer picture of the investment potential in the semiconductor industry.

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Monday as investors prepared for a slate of inflation data later in the week and braced for the start of the second-quarter earnings season.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39 points, or 0.11%. Nasdaq-100 futures dropped 0.19%, while S&amp;P 500 lost just 0.03%.
*****
&gt; This week’s inflation data follows a rate hike skip at the June Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The consumer price index report is due out Wednesday, followed by the producer price index — a measure of wholesale price pressures — due Thursday.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a losing week. The S&amp;P 500 pulled back 1.16%, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.92% and 1.96%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Despite nonfarm payrolls growing less than expected in June, slightly stronger-than-expected wage growth raised concern over the potential for more Federal Reserve rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Investors also have a slew of quarterly earnings reports to consider this week. Finance behemoths BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citi will all report and kick off the second-quarter earnings season.
*****
&gt; “We believe S&amp;P 500 earnings will face significant pressure during the rest of the year and enter an earnings recession,” Morgan Stanley analyst Edward Stanley wrote in a Sunday note to investors. “The reason is negative operating leverage — when cost growth exceeds sales growth, earnings growth takes a steep hit.”

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Monday, June 10th, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good Monday morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Monday, June 10th, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/09/stock-futures-are-flat-ahead-of-a-key-inflation-data-week-for-wall-street-and-the-kickoff-of-second-quarter-earnings-season.html""&gt;Stock futures are flat ahead of key inflation data this week and the start of Q2 earnings season: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock futures were little changed Monday as investors prepared for a slate of inflation data later in the week and braced for the start of the second-quarter earnings season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39 points, or 0.11%. Nasdaq-100 futures dropped 0.19%, while S&amp;amp;P 500 lost just 0.03%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s inflation data follows a rate hike skip at the June Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The consumer price index report is due out Wednesday, followed by the producer price index — a measure of wholesale price pressures — due Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is coming off a losing week. The S&amp;amp;P 500 pulled back 1.16%, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.92% and 1.96%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite nonfarm payrolls growing less than expected in June, slightly stronger-than-expected wage growth raised concern over the potential for more Federal Reserve rate hikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors also have a slew of quarterly earnings reports to consider this week. Finance behemoths BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citi will all report and kick off the second-quarter earnings season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We believe S&amp;amp;P 500 earnings will face significant pressure during the rest of the year and enter an earnings recession,” Morgan Stanley analyst Edward Stanley wrote in a Sunday note to investors. “The reason is negative operating leverage — when cost growth exceeds sales growth, earnings growth takes a steep hit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance Auto Parts&lt;/strong&gt; — Advance Auto Parts declined 2.4% in the premarket after Atlantic Equities on Monday downgraded the stock to underweight, and cut its price target to $50. That represents about 28% downside. Analyst Sam Hudson said the firm’s “ongoing weak performance as indicative of structural challenges and significant share losses.”&lt;/p&gt;

705,stocks,"This week's casual valuation is Zoom. I hope you enjoy these posts and feel free to add your take.

Disclaimer: I do not own shares in Zoom

&amp;#x200B;

The post is divided into the following sections:

* Zoom today vs. Zoom 4 years ago
* My previous valuation of Zoom (March 2022)
* Historical financial performance
* The bad news
* Revenue split
* Management's story (and what is misleading)
* Assumptions &amp; Valuation
* Valuation based on assumptions different than mine

&amp;#x200B;

**Zoom today vs. Zoom 4 years ago**

Zoom is one of the companies that without a doubt had significant benefits from the pandemic. The share price is up 6% since the first trading day, but I'll argue that the company is A LOT cheaper than it was 4 years ago.

It is best to illustrate that with a simple table:

&amp;#x200B;

||LTM (April 30th, 2019)|LTM (April 30th, 2023)|Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue (in $m)|$213|$4,393|1959%|
|\# of shares outstanding (in m)|272|298|9%|
|Share price|$62.00|$65.67|6%|
|Market cap (in $m)|$16,892|$19,540|16%|
|Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities &amp; strategic investments|$737|$6,049|721%|
|Debt|$103|$91|\-11%|
|Deferred revenue|$149|$1,366|815%|
|Enterprise value|$16,407|$14,948|\-9%|

**Enterprise value** is calculated as follows: Market cap **minus** Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities &amp; strategic investments **plus** Debt **plus** Deferred revenue.

Zoom is almost 20x the size it was 4 years ago, and 9% cheaper.

&amp;#x200B;

**My previous valuation of Zoom (March 2022)**

This is not the first time that I looked into Zoom. The previous valuation was a bit over a year ago when the share price was $116.28, and based on my assumptions, the fair value was $78.45.

There are some changes in my assumptions, mainly related to the growth rate, and the higher discount rate( due to the increase in the risk-free rate).

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

A good place to start to reveal what I think is bad news for Zoom is the financials. Let's start with the revenue change:

2020: **88%**

2021: **326%** (Pandemic growth)

2022: **55%** (Pandemic growth)

2023: **7%**

*\*Fiscal years ending January, hence year 2023 represents the 12 months between February 2022 and January 2023.*

&amp;#x200B;

The pandemic is behind us, and so is Zoom's growth story. I don't think this was unexpected as the demand for their products has reduced significantly.

&amp;#x200B;

If we take a look at the 3 buckets of operating expenses, that's where it gets a bit odd. Here's a short summary for 2023:

* **Research &amp; Development $774m (18% of revenue)** \- higher than the historical average, and this is crucial for developing new products. Not all benefits from the new product introductions will be reflected in the current year, hence, a correlation between R&amp;D and revenue growth in the same year should not be expected.
* **General &amp; Administrative $576m (13% of revenue)** \- in line with historical average
* **Selling &amp; Marketing $1.7 billion (39% of revenue)**  \- Huge increase compared to 2022 when this was $1.1 billion (28% of revenue)

&amp;#x200B;

This leads to the bad news. For those that want a challenge, you can try to link the information above yourself and see if there's a red flag that you see.

&amp;#x200B;

**The bad news**

The purpose of Selling &amp; Marketing expenses is to promote their products to the target customers and ultimately contribute to revenue growth.

During FY 2023, Zoom spent $1.7 billion, which is a lot more than ever before, yet, the revenue growth was only 7% (less than $300 million). This seems quite odd, so I decided to take a look at how much it actually costs Zoom to acquire customers through this lens.

&amp;#x200B;

||Selling &amp; Marketing (in $m)|Absolute revenue change vs. PY (in $m)|The ratio between the two|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2019|$186|$180|**$1.03**|
|2020|$341|$292|**$1.17**|
|2021|$685|$2,028|**$0.34**|
|2022|$1,136|$1,49|**$0.78**|
|2023|$1,697|$293|**$5.79**|
|LTM (April 30th, 2023)|$1,757|$206|**$8.53**|

&amp;#x200B;

During 2019/2020 (pre-pandemic), to get $1 in revenue, it cost Zoom slightly over $1 in Selling &amp; Marketing.

During 2021/2022 (pandemic), it cost them a lot less, as customers were flowing organically.

In 2023, it costs them $5.79, a huge increase. Not only that but if we take the last quarter into account, it gets worse to $8.53!

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, the management wants to keep the ""growth story"" around Zoom. For that purpose, they spent as much as needed on Selling &amp; Marketing, to acquire customers, so there is at least some growth.

However, this growth is eating their margins.

The operating margin is down from 25% to 6% and that is not creating sufficient value for the shareholders, to justify today's market cap.

&amp;#x200B;

**Revenue split**

Zoom has two types of customers:

* Online customers - representing the ones that have subscribed directly from the website. This consists mostly of individuals &amp; small/medium businesses
* Enterprise customers

In 2021, 54% of all revenue was generated by online customers. For the last twelve months, that is down to 44%, meaning the enterprise customers are now generating 56% of the revenue.

Although there's nothing wrong with this, it is important to note the management's story behind this.

&amp;#x200B;

**Management's story (and what is misleading)**

I looked at the presentations and here are some extracts that I think are important:

1. Growth with Enterprise customers outpacing online and individual *(Source: Investor Day presentation November 2022)*
2. Continued top-line growth with positive trends in Enterprise and Online (*Source: Q1-2024 earnings presentation*)

The first statement is quite obvious, but I'll argue that the 2nd one is not only misleading but also incorrect. Here's how the revenue is developing since 2021 (that is when Zoom started providing the split of revenue between the two groups):

&amp;#x200B;

||Online customers (in $m)|Enterprise customers (in $m)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2021|$1,442|$1,209|
|2022|$2,148|$1,952|
|2023|$1,986|$2,407|
|LTM (April 30th, 2023)|$1,945|$2,479|

Is there anything strange that you see? If not, focus on the online customers' column. Do you see ""top-line growth with positive trend""?

Me neither.

The growth related to Enterprise customers can definitely be seen as a positive sign, but we should not forget the huge Selling &amp; Marketing expense that was driving it, which ultimately doesn't lead to a creation of value for the shareholders.

The outlook for 2024 is revenue around $4.5b (growth below 2% vs. 2023), which doesn't seem too impressive, but the analysts do expect the growth to resume in the years that follow.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumptions &amp; Valuation**

Here are my assumptions for the future:

**Revenue growth**: 4% per year (Rationale: On one side, Zoom is investing heavily in R&amp;D, which is expected to bring new products and additional revenue. However, the company is operating in an extremely competitive landscape. Therefore, I expect low growth in the future)

**Operating margin**: 5% for next year, growing to 20% by year 10 (Rationale: The management has to cut S&amp;M expenses in the coming period and deliver profitability and free cash flow. This means they won't grow a lot, which is what I expect in the assumption above)

**Discount rate:** 11.5%

After adjusting for what is on their balance sheet, as well as the equity options outstanding, the value of Zoom is roughly **$8.8 billion ($29.55/share)**.

For comparison, today’s market cap is $19.5 billion ($65.67/share).

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**

The future is uncertain and my assumptions could be significantly wrong. Let's take a look at how the valuation (per share) changes if we use different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.

|Revenue / Operating margin|17%|20%|23%|26%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|34% ($5.9b)|$24.7|$26.6|$29.0|$32.2|
|48% ($6.5b)|$27.2|$29.6|$32.6|$36.3|
|75% ($7.7b)|$29.6|$32.4|$36.0|$40.3|
|100% ($8.8b)|$31.8|$35.0|$39.0|$43.9|

Even if Zoom doubles its revenue (representing a 7.2% annual growth rate) and expands its margin to 26%, it would still be overvalued.

Could I be wrong? Absolutely.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom today vs. Zoom 4 years ago&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom is one of the companies that without a doubt had significant benefits from the pandemic. The share price is up 6% since the first trading day, but I&amp;#39;ll argue that the company is A LOT cheaper than it was 4 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is best to illustrate that with a simple table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Market cap (in $m)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$16,892&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$19,540&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$6,049&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;721%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Debt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$103&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$91&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-11%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Deferred revenue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$149&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$1,366&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;815%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Enterprise value&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$16,407&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$14,948&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-9%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise value&lt;/strong&gt; is calculated as follows: Market cap &lt;strong&gt;minus&lt;/strong&gt; Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities &amp;amp; strategic investments &lt;strong&gt;plus&lt;/strong&gt; Debt &lt;strong&gt;plus&lt;/strong&gt; Deferred revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom is almost 20x the size it was 4 years ago, and 9% cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My previous valuation of Zoom (March 2022)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that I looked into Zoom. The previous valuation was a bit over a year ago when the share price was $116.28, and based on my assumptions, the fair value was $78.45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some changes in my assumptions, mainly related to the growth rate, and the higher discount rate( due to the increase in the risk-free rate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historical financial performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good place to start to reveal what I think is bad news for Zoom is the financials. Let&amp;#39;s start with the revenue change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020: &lt;strong&gt;88%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021: &lt;strong&gt;326%&lt;/strong&gt; (Pandemic growth)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022: &lt;strong&gt;55%&lt;/strong&gt; (Pandemic growth)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2023: &lt;strong&gt;7%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;Fiscal years ending January, hence year 2023 represents the 12 months between February 2022 and January 2023.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pandemic is behind us, and so is Zoom&amp;#39;s growth story. I don&amp;#39;t think this was unexpected as the demand for their products has reduced significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we take a look at the 3 buckets of operating expenses, that&amp;#39;s where it gets a bit odd. Here&amp;#39;s a short summary for 2023:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research &amp;amp; Development $774m (18% of revenue)&lt;/strong&gt; - higher than the historical average, and this is crucial for developing new products. Not all benefits from the new product introductions will be reflected in the current year, hence, a correlation between R&amp;amp;D and revenue growth in the same year should not be expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General &amp;amp; Administrative $576m (13% of revenue)&lt;/strong&gt; - in line with historical average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selling &amp;amp; Marketing $1.7 billion (39% of revenue)&lt;/strong&gt;  - Huge increase compared to 2022 when this was $1.1 billion (28% of revenue)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to the bad news. For those that want a challenge, you can try to link the information above yourself and see if there&amp;#39;s a red flag that you see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bad news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of Selling &amp;amp; Marketing expenses is to promote their products to the target customers and ultimately contribute to revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During FY 2023, Zoom spent $1.7 billion, which is a lot more than ever before, yet, the revenue growth was only 7% (less than $300 million). This seems quite odd, so I decided to take a look at how much it actually costs Zoom to acquire customers through this lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2019&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$186&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$180&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$1.03&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2020&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$341&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$292&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$1.17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2021&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$685&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$2,028&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$0.34&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2022&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$1,136&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$1,49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$0.78&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2023&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$1,697&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$293&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$5.79&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;LTM (April 30th, 2023)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$1,757&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$206&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$8.53&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 2019/2020 (pre-pandemic), to get $1 in revenue, it cost Zoom slightly over $1 in Selling &amp;amp; Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 2021/2022 (pandemic), it cost them a lot less, as customers were flowing organically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, it costs them $5.79, a huge increase. Not only that but if we take the last quarter into account, it gets worse to $8.53!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the management wants to keep the &amp;quot;growth story&amp;quot; around Zoom. For that purpose, they spent as much as needed on Selling &amp;amp; Marketing, to acquire customers, so there is at least some growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this growth is eating their margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operating margin is down from 25% to 6% and that is not creating sufficient value for the shareholders, to justify today&amp;#39;s market cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue split&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom has two types of customers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online customers - representing the ones that have subscribed directly from the website. This consists mostly of individuals &amp;amp; small/medium businesses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, 54% of all revenue was generated by online customers. For the last twelve months, that is down to 44%, meaning the enterprise customers are now generating 56% of the revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with this, it is important to note the management&amp;#39;s story behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management&amp;#39;s story (and what is misleading)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at the presentations and here are some extracts that I think are important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth with Enterprise customers outpacing online and individual &lt;em&gt;(Source: Investor Day presentation November 2022)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued top-line growth with positive trends in Enterprise and Online (&lt;em&gt;Source: Q1-2024 earnings presentation&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first statement is quite obvious, but I&amp;#39;ll argue that the 2nd one is not only misleading but also incorrect. Here&amp;#39;s how the revenue is developing since 2021 (that is when Zoom started providing the split of revenue between the two groups):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Enterprise customers (in $m)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2021&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$1,442&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$1,209&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2022&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$2,148&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$1,952&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2023&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$1,986&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$2,407&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;LTM (April 30th, 2023)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$1,945&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$2,479&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything strange that you see? If not, focus on the online customers&amp;#39; column. Do you see &amp;quot;top-line growth with positive trend&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me neither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth related to Enterprise customers can definitely be seen as a positive sign, but we should not forget the huge Selling &amp;amp; Marketing expense that was driving it, which ultimately doesn&amp;#39;t lead to a creation of value for the shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outlook for 2024 is revenue around $4.5b (growth below 2% vs. 2023), which doesn&amp;#39;t seem too impressive, but the analysts do expect the growth to resume in the years that follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumptions &amp;amp; Valuation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my assumptions for the future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue growth&lt;/strong&gt;: 4% per year (Rationale: On one side, Zoom is investing heavily in R&amp;amp;D, which is expected to bring new products and additional revenue. However, the company is operating in an extremely competitive landscape. Therefore, I expect low growth in the future)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating margin&lt;/strong&gt;: 5% for next year, growing to 20% by year 10 (Rationale: The management has to cut S&amp;amp;M expenses in the coming period and deliver profitability and free cash flow. This means they won&amp;#39;t grow a lot, which is what I expect in the assumption above)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discount rate:&lt;/strong&gt; 11.5%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for what is on their balance sheet, as well as the equity options outstanding, the value of Zoom is roughly &lt;strong&gt;$8.8 billion ($29.55/share)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For comparison, today’s market cap is $19.5 billion ($65.67/share).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valuation based on assumptions different than mine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future is uncertain and my assumptions could be significantly wrong. Let&amp;#39;s take a look at how the valuation (per share) changes if we use different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Revenue / Operating margin&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;17%&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;20%&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;23%&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;26%&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;34% ($5.9b)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$24.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$26.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$29.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$32.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;48% ($6.5b)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$27.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$29.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$32.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$36.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;75% ($7.7b)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$29.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$32.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$36.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$40.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;100% ($8.8b)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$31.8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$35.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$39.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$43.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if Zoom doubles its revenue (representing a 7.2% annual growth rate) and expands its margin to 26%, it would still be overvalued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could I be wrong? Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

Stocks and options are gambling for the:

1) you are making a bet.

2) the outcome is uncertain

3) the probability is your ability to be right on the direction of trade. alternatively you can look at it as the odds stocks go up historically, odds companies fail, odds that companies with xyz metrics do well well or poorly.

Reasons ive seen come up over the years:

1) you own a piece of the company. in practice you  get anything in the secondary market so its the same as owning nothing.

2) dividends - these are risk mitigators and does not detract from the premise as why stocks trading is gambling. its like gow whales who go to casinos get kick backs for showing up. dividends is similar. the company paying you 3-5% but you can lose 1-100%.

3) gambling is random luck with no skill in it, whereas trading requires deep analysis.

711,stocks,"As the market continues to price in higher interest rates for longer, there is opportunity in owning floating rate securities.  CIM-B is a preferred stock issued by Chimera Investment Corporation with a fixed rate coupon of 8.0%.  CIM-B trades at a 15% discount to par leading to a current rate of 9.4%.

On 3/30/24, 9 months from now, CIM-B switches to a floating rate security of 5.79% + 3m SOFR + 0.26%.  The 3m SOFR is the replacement for LIBOR and is currently at 5.26%.  That puts the floating rate coupon at 11.3%.  At the current price of $21.34, the yield would be 13.2%.

My investment thesis is that CIM-B moves to its par value of $25 over the next 9 months.  I think there will be $1.50 in dividends and $3.66 in capital gains in those 9 months resulting in a  24% total return.  I think $25 is a fair price because that puts the yield at 130 bps higher than the fixed rate CIM-A, more than enough additional yield to compensate for the potential for rate decreases.  However, $25 is roughly the maximum share price as CIM can redeem the shares at $25 at anytime after 3/30/24.  I wouldn’t be surprised if CIM does redeem the shares, a win for investors.

CIM-B is far from risk free, but I think the potential for a quick 9 month profit is worth the risk.  CIM owns residential mortgages.  Not the type guaranteed by Freddie or Fannie. If you remember the Big Short’s quote of dog shit wrapped in cat shit.  CIM owns the dog shit.  It’s not as bad as 2007.  The mortgages have low loan to value (LTV) as mortgage standards are tighter and the housing market has had considerable appreciation since the mortgages were written.  The job market for subprime mortgage customers is strong.  CIM has minimal leverage allowing it to handle delinquencies.  

It’s not a risk free 24% 9 month return, but I’m comfortable with it.

Here’s the CIM [investor presentation](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_a0f938f160fc1c8a4f78fe77ecb8044f/chimerareit/db/862/7941/pdf/Investor+Presentation+June+2023_Final+%281%29.pdf)

I encourage you to look up the details of CIM-B  at QuantumOnline.com.  Benefits of CIM-B include cumulative dividends (if CIM can’t pay preferred dividends, they accrue and must be fully paid before their common stock can pay a dividend.). CIM is an mREIT that must pay out 90% of profits to maintain its tax status, meaning the preferred stock dividends must be paid.  Not a tax advisor, but every mREIT dividend I’ve seen qualifies as a 199A tax break effectively leading to dividends taxed at only 80% of your marginal tax rate.

716,stocks,"One of the questions that many META shareholders have is, what is the impact of Threads on the company’s value?

The answer isn’t simple, and I’ll try to break down the components and share my thoughts.

Mark Zuckerberg shared that monetization options would be explored once Threads hits one billion users (As am I writing this, there are over 83 million users. For comparison, Twitter has close to 400 million).  
  
From Meta’s point of view, the so-called family of Apps includes two social media platforms - Facebook and Instagram. Both of these platforms are in mature monetization stages, where both the revenue per user and the margins are incredibly high.  
  
If we take a look at the big picture, all social media companies make money by selling advertisements. The formula behind that is simple:

**Number of users** X **Time spent on the platform** X **Advertisement revenue**

The time that is being spent is limited, every one of us has 24 hours in a day and decides how to use (or waste) it.  
  
Part of the Facebook/Instagram users will use part of their time using Threads and the impact is obvious. If we take a look at the formula above, it is quite clear that the time spent on Facebook/Instagram will be lower, hence, the revenue generated there is expected to decrease. In addition, as Threads is not monetized, it will only bring additional expenses for keeping the platform up and running. In the short run, there shouldn’t be high expectations for Meta when it comes to the financials.

Whether Threads will generate value, in the long run, depends on a few factors:

\- The # of users that join Threads, from Twitter.

\- The monetization per user of Threads, and how far it will be compared to Facebook/Instagram (So far, Twitter didn’t use its potential)

\- The outcome of the cease-and-desist letter sent to Meta by Spiro (Elon’s lawyer) for creating a “copycat” app.

&amp;#x200B;

Meta's value will increase, only if:  
  
\- The total number of users (Facebook/Instagram/Threads) increases at the expense of Twitter, and;

\- The revenue generated is higher and can cover the additional expenses for running Threads.

718,stocks,"A surge in US real yields, reflecting the return on bonds adjusted for inflation, has raised concerns among investors about the implications for riskier assets such as stocks. The yield on 10-year inflation-protected securities (Tips) reached 1.82% on Friday, the highest level since 2009, as investors increasingly anticipated the Federal Reserve maintaining higher interest rates to combat inflation.

Real yields serve as a vital indicator of borrowing costs throughout the economy, influencing the relative attractiveness of risky assets. The recent surge in real yields has made low-risk government debt more appealing, thereby diminishing the attractiveness of other investment options. This rise in borrowing costs is reminiscent of last October when bonds experienced a sharp sell-off, coinciding with a period of greater uncertainty surrounding US inflation.

The repercussions of this increase in real yields pose a significant risk to the corporate sector. Debt acquired when interest rates were at or near zero may now require refinancing at much higher rates. Salman Ahmed, global head of macro and strategic asset allocation at Fidelity International, explains that the problem arises when companies need to refinance debt that was initially borrowed in a low-interest rate environment.

For instance, a high-yield company that secured funding at around 4% during the pandemic may now face interest rates exceeding 12%. The impact of this sudden increase in borrowing costs could be severe for these companies as they grapple with the financial burden of refinancing their debt at significantly higher rates. Such a shock to the financial system can exert downward pressure on the affected company’s share price, potentially leading to increased volatility in the equity market.

Furthermore, analysts anticipate that the effects of higher borrowing costs will be more acutely felt in the latter half of next year and into 2025. Many companies took advantage of slashed interest rates during pandemic lockdowns to secure loans, supporting the economy. However, with lending already slowing down this year, the tighter financial conditions resulting from rising yields may amplify the challenges faced by businesses.

The implications of these shifting monetary and financial conditions are not limited to individual companies. Investors are growing increasingly concerned about US equity valuations as financial conditions tighten. The relationship between stock prices and returns compared to Tips is changing. Jon Day, fixed income portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management, highlights the need for higher equity returns to match the rising real yields. The disparity between expected equity returns and the current market conditions is a significant factor behind the recent stock sell-off triggered by the Fed minutes.

While equities have experienced substantial gains this year, largely driven by investor enthusiasm for companies leveraging artificial intelligence, some investors question whether a buoyant stock market and apprehensive bond investors can both be correct.

Overall, the surge in US real yields carries substantial implications for various aspects of the financial landscape. The shock of higher borrowing costs for companies that raised funds at lower rates during the pandemic can significantly impact their share prices. 

Additionally, the slowdown in lending, coupled with tightening monetary and financial conditions, raises concerns about the valuation of companies. As investors grapple with these uncertainties, the relationship between stock prices and real yields becomes a crucial factor to watch in the coming months.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A surge in US real yields, reflecting the return on bonds adjusted for inflation, has raised concerns among investors about the implications for riskier assets such as stocks.

I have a stupid question with a standard obvious text-book answer goes like ""are you dumb?."" But I am curious anyway about your creative ways of saying it.

I have a friend who I know for a long time and he is interested in stock market for the past few years. He is looking for indicators and trying to apply them to different indicies, shares, CFDs etc. Recently his claim was that he found never loosing indicators. His argument is that those indicators work with 5mins intervals on some assets and 1 hour in some others. They involve having put and call options depending on what indicators signal with the current market value, volume trend etc. 

He makes all the hyper-parameter optimization using past data and further proposes that, in 1 to 2 year time windows, he could have made 40%, 50% and even 100% net  profits using these indicators including comissions etc. When we ask why there is that much gain but absolutely no risks, his argument is okey in the long run if not making 50% 100% profit then 25% 30% is still free money that one should get.

I am a novice trader who is learning and enjoying it and consider it as securing my today savings' purchasing power for the future. Besides I have my day job and I find it too stressful to make high frequency trades. Even in slow pace, I think it is sometimes stressful. All things put asside, when I check public funds managed by pros and their performances, they don't make 50% 100% net profits every year. If this is something that obvious such that one guy realize at home looking at the graphs, then why not everybody is making this as their only job? Paradoxically, if everybody applies the same and simple tactic, then no one could have won. Anyway...

724,stocks,"Over the past two weeks, a comprehensive set of economic data has provided economists and investors with a detailed understanding of the US economy. Notably, today’s market reversal was driven by a shift in market expectations for the Federal Reserve’s target rate, presenting a challenging path forward for the stock market and raising uncertainties.

The latest labor market data revealed a hint of tepidness in the June nonfarm payrolls report. Job growth of 209,000 fell slightly below consensus expectations, and revisions showed a net gain of 99,000 jobs, signaling a slower pace compared to previous months. This suggests that the ongoing reduction in the M2 measure of money is gaining traction and beginning to impact the economy. Tight monetary policy, as a result of the Federal Reserve’s hiking cycle, is starting to have an effect.

Despite the softer labor market data, it is unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from raising short-term interest rates at the upcoming July 26 meeting. Civilian employment, including small-business start-ups, rose by 273,000, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.6%. Average hourly earnings increased, and total hours worked saw an uptick, reinforcing the belief that the Fed perceives the need for further stabilization of the economy through additional rate hikes.

A divergence becomes apparent when shifting focus to the goods and services sectors. The ISM Manufacturing index continued its contraction for the eighth consecutive month, reflecting concerns about a slowing US economy and reduced customer demand. In contrast, the ISM Services index rose to 53.9 in June, with fifteen out of eighteen major industries reporting growth, surpassing even the most optimistic forecasts. While signs of a potential recession loom, the services side of the economy appears to be holding up for now, with business activity and new orders within the services sector remaining in expansion territory.

International trade data indicated a decline in the trade deficit for goods and services to $69.0 billion in May, accompanied by decreases in both imports and exports. This aligns with forecasts of a recession, reflecting weakened domestic demand for goods and a shift towards increased spending on services. Import numbers from China have plummeted by 24.3% compared to the same period last year, resulting in China slipping to the third-largest exporter to the US behind Mexico and Canada. Falling daily freight rates further indicate a weakened global trade environment.

The most significant market impact today was driven by new expectations for the Federal Reserve’s target rate. The provided data reveals an increasing probability, now at 92.4%, of the target rate falling within the 525-550 basis points range. This shift in rate expectations has led investors to reassess their strategies and pricing models, incorporating the potential impact on various asset classes.

Though rates off recent highs, this week's still-large backup in yields reflects fears of a more aggressive Fed and continued global tightening (though market pricing continues to forecast only a single July rate hike before the Fed pauses).

Considering the implications for the stock market, the outlook appears uncertain. The ongoing slowdown in the goods sector, coupled with reduced demand and inventory buildup, raises concerns about future factory output. Persistent inflationary pressures, as indicated by the prices index within the manufacturing sector, pose challenges for companies.

As the market adjusts to shifting rate expectations and economic indicators, caution should be exercised. The stock market may face downward pressure as it navigates these uncertainties, potentially impacting company valuations and investor sentiment. Market participants are urged to closely monitor developments, adapt investment strategies accordingly, and remain diligent in risk management.

The message the world’s top central bankers delivered late last month could not have been clearer. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, and his US and eurozone counterparts Jay Powell and Christine Lagarde, all insisted that high inflation — and high interest rates — would endure.

The impact of the shifting economic landscape and changing rate expectations will mainly impact cyclical stocks, stocks particularly sensitive to economic fluctuations. Cyclical stock industries include automotive, construction, technology hardware, manufacturing, consumer durables, housing, airlines, travel and leisure. The slowdown in the goods sector, coupled with potential rate hikes, could present challenges for companies within these sectors.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two weeks, a comprehensive set of economic data has provided economists and investors with a detailed understanding of the US economy.

Import numbers from China have plummeted by 24.3% compared to the same period last year, resulting in China slipping to the third-largest exporter to the US behind Mexico and Canada. Falling daily freight rates further indicate a weakened global trade environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant market impact today was driven by new expectations for the Federal Reserve’s target rate. The provided data reveals an increasing probability, now at 92.4%, of the target rate falling within the 525-550 basis points range. This shift in rate expectations has led investors to reassess their strategies and pricing models, incorporating the potential impact on various asset classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though rates off recent highs, this week&amp;#39;s still-large backup in yields reflects fears of a more aggressive Fed and continued global tightening (though market pricing continues to forecast only a single July rate hike before the Fed pauses).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the implications for the stock market, the outlook appears uncertain. The ongoing slowdown in the goods sector, coupled with reduced demand and inventory buildup, raises concerns about future factory output. Persistent inflationary pressures, as indicated by the prices index within the manufacturing sector, pose challenges for companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the market adjusts to shifting rate expectations and economic indicators, caution should be exercised. The stock market may face downward pressure as it navigates these uncertainties, potentially impacting company valuations and investor sentiment. Market participants are urged to closely monitor developments, adapt investment strategies accordingly, and remain diligent in risk management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message the world’s top central bankers delivered late last month could not have been clearer. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, and his US and eurozone counterparts Jay Powell and Christine Lagarde, all insisted that high inflation — and high interest rates — would endure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of the shifting economic landscape and changing rate expectations will mainly impact cyclical stocks, stocks particularly sensitive to economic fluctuations. Cyclical stock industries include automotive, construction, technology hardware, manufacturing, consumer durables, housing, airlines, travel and leisure. The slowdown in the goods sector, coupled with potential rate hikes, could present challenges for companies within these sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

# **Stocks tumble on Friday, notching weekly losses, as traders' rate hike fears return: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks fell on Friday, and finished lower for the week, as Wall Street struggled to shake off fears that the Federal Reserve may start hiking rates again later this month.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 lost 0.29% to end at 4,398.95, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.13% to close at 13,660.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 187.38 points, or 0.55%, to settle at 33,734.88.
*****
&gt; All three major averages capped a losing week. The S&amp;P dropped 1.16%, while the Nasdaq declined 0.92%. The Dow shed 1.96% for its worst weekly performance since March.
*****
&gt; The Labor Department’s June jobs report showed payrolls increased less than expected, cooling down from May. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 209,000, while the unemployment rate came in at 3.6%. Economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated 240,000 positions added and a similar jobless level.
*****
&gt; But parts of the report, including stronger-than-expected wage numbers, heightened fears that the central bank may have reason to resume hiking later this month. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.4% in June and 4.4% from a year ago. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate declined from 3.7% in May.
*****
&gt; “It’s kind of a mixed picture today,” said Truist’s Keith Lerner. “It’s good news that the economy is not falling apart, it’s still chugging along, but you still have these wage pressures that are going to keep the Fed likely to raise rates at the end of the month.”
*****
&gt; Near term, Lerner said equities are ripe for a pullback following a big June and second quarter. This could lead to consolidation and choppy action as markets head into earnings season.
*****
&gt; Following Friday’s big data release, traders kept their bets on a resumption in hiking later this month, pricing in a 92% chance of a quarter-point hike on July 26. Those are about the same odds as a day ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Policymakers indicated at their June gathering that two more rate hikes could be ahead in 2023.

&gt; # Stellar NASDAQ 1st Half Dampens July and Q3 Performance

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2ff76af69a1691d77dc884e4bcd1c2d9/7b1ae60421497f18-3e/s500x750/e83d26bb66b714c132d4b619a7964df03e674810.jpg))**

&gt; NASDAQ finished the first half of 2023 with a stellar 31.7% gain. This is NASDAQ’s third best first half ever. Only 1975 and 1983 were better. In the following table we compiled all years since 1971 when NASDAQ was up 20% or more in the first half. Reviewing the table, we observed only two times out of the past eleven where the second half of the year was better than the first half (1999 and 2003). July and Q3 were also below average following a 20%+ first half gain while Q4 was better than average.

&gt; This reinforces our existing tepid outlook for Q3. Today’s much stronger than anticipated jobs data has increased expectations for another Fed interest rate hike and added more uncertainty as to when the Fed will eventually pause. Increasing uncertainty is likely to lead to more volatility and a sideways to possibly lower market during the historically weak third quarter.

&gt; # Big Picture: The Economy is Normalizing

&gt; We started this year discussing how the economy has been at the “edge of normal” in our 2023 outlook. The good news is that we have slowly but surely moved towards normal since then, even in the face of a banking crisis and debt ceiling drama. The “soft” economic data from sentiment surveys have been poor, but the “hard” data that measure actual employment, sales, and production, have painted a much brighter picture.

&gt; We discussed last month how we combine a lot of the economic data into our own proprietary leading economic index (LEI), which we produce for 30 countries around the world, each one custom-built to capture the dynamics of those economies. The individual country LEIs are also subsequently rolled up into a global index to give us a picture of the global economy. The idea is to give us an early warning signal about economic turning points. Simply put, it tells us what the economy is doing today and what it is likely to do in the near future.

&gt; For example, our index for the U.S. includes 20+ components, including consumer-related indicators (which make up 50% of the index), housing activity, business and manufacturing activity, as well as sentiment and financial markets data. This contrasts with other popular LEIs, which are premised on the fact that the manufacturing sector and business activity/sentiment are leading indicators of the economy. This worked well in the past but is probably not indicative of what’s happening in the economy right now.

&gt; Right now, our LEI suggests the US economy is growing along trend, or slightly above it. The economic picture looks even better than it did at the end of 2022. Six months ago, the risk of recession was higher, though even then, the LEI didn’t say that we were in a recession, or even very close to one.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-06-US-LEI-675x800.png))**

&gt; However, we’re seeing some interesting dynamics under the hood.

&gt; # 2022 Headwinds are Fading
&gt; As I mentioned above, our LEI has been consistently saying that the U.S. economy is not in a recession. That was almost entirely thanks to a resilient consumer, with strong employment gains powering incomes and consumption. Pushing against this was an aggressive Federal Reserve and tighter financial conditions. Consequently, the sector that took the biggest hit last year was housing, followed by a slowdown in business spending and manufacturing activity.

&gt; But a turnaround looks to be happening now.

&gt; As you can see below, the LEI has been rebounding over the last few months. That’s come on the back of declining headwinds from housing (yellow), business/manufacturing activity (green), and financial conditions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-06-LEI-breakdown-667x800.png))**

&gt; In fact, housing has moved to being a positive contributor! We’ve written about how why we believe housing will no longer be a drag on the economy after 8 straight quarters of pulling GDP growth lower. Even business activity is exerting a lower drag on the economy – we just wrote last week about how investment has been rising recently, hopefully signaling a bottom.

&gt; Financial conditions appear to be easing, especially with the Fed moderating the pace of rate hikes and interest rates inching close to their terminal level for the cycle.

&gt; Most importantly, consumption remains positive, though less so than a few months ago. This is not really a concern in my opinion (at least, not yet), as it simply indicates that consumption trends are normalizing. The latest contribution from consumption to our LEI is equivalent to its pre-pandemic contributions.

&gt; Ultimately, the big picture is that the economy looks to be finally normalizing after a few years of being whipped around by the pandemic, and its after-effects.

&gt; # Factory Orders Go Negative

&gt; The last 24 hours have been rough for economic data both in the US and around the world as most indicators released have been weaker than expected. It started with weaker-than-expected PMI readings for the services sector in China but has since spread to weaker PMI readings for most major economies in the Eurozone as well. Here in the US, PMI data on the services sector will not be forthcoming until tomorrow morning, but Factory Orders released this morning were a big miss. At the headline level, orders for the month of May increased 0.3% which was a half percentage point below consensus expectations. Not only that but April’s reading was also revised down from growth of 0.4% down to 0.3%. After stripping out Transportation, Factory Orders declined 0.5% while April’s reading was revised from a decline of 0.2% down to a drop of 0.6%.

&gt; On a year/year basis, Factory Orders also dipped into negative territory for the first time since October 2020. The chart below shows the historical y/y change in Factory Orders since 1960. While readings were negative during every recession, there were plenty of other periods where they also declined on a y/y basis and the economy was nowhere near a recession. Not only that but there were also many other periods during economic expansions where Factory Orders dropped by a much larger amount on a y/y basis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/070523-Factory-YY.png))**

&gt; While the magnitude of the decline in Factory Orders hasn’t been extreme, what is unique about the current period is how long the rate of change in Factory Orders has been declining. The chart below shows streaks where the y/y change in Factory Orders increased (blue line) or declined (red line). With May’s report, the rate of change in Factory Orders on a year/year basis has declined for a record eight straight months, breaking the prior record of seven months that was seen during recessions in the mid-1970s, early 1980s, and during the Financial Crisis. The fact that prior streaks of similar duration all occurred during recessions isn’t exactly reassuring. What makes it less worrisome, though, is that the decline is coming after Durable Goods experienced record growth and consistency of growth coming out of the COVID crash.

&gt; There's plenty of evidence out there to cite as reasons why the US economy is teetering on the edge of a recession or merely in a slowdown, and parts of today's Factory Orders report could honestly be used to help justify either viewpoint.

&gt; # Why July Brings the Bulls

&gt; “I am an optimist because I don’t see the point in being anything else.” -Abraham Lincoln

&gt; And with that, the first half of the year is a wrap. What can we say other than all those calls for a recession and new bear market lows sure didn’t play out. We were one of the only places predicting there wouldn’t be a recession this year and to look for stocks to possibly gain 12-15% (and maybe more with some good news). It was a lonely call and we took a lot of heat for it, but we are noticing more and more shops are coming over to the no-recession camp.

&gt; I noted in Why a Sunny Second Half of 2023 is Likely some reasons to expect more gains after the big start to this year. Well, here’s another angle on that. I looked at all the years that were up more than 10% at the midpoint of the year, but were also negative the year before. In other words, a potential slingshot move. Sure enough, stocks did even better when this took place, with the S&amp;P 500 higher those final six months eight out of nine times and up a median of 12.4% – well above the median final six month return of 7.7% when those first six months gain more than 10%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-1-6-800x488.png))**

&gt; So, can this surprise summer rally continue? As Honest Abe would say, might as well be an optimist and we think it can, as July historically is a strong month. Of course, it isn’t just about seasonals, as the realization the economy may not be going into a recession and a Fed that is likely done hiking are both also positives, which should keep things moving higher in July.

&gt; For starters, stocks have gained 9 of the past 10 years in July, with no month sporting a better average return over the past decade than the 3.3% July gain for the S&amp;P 500. Why is this you ask? The one thing I keep thinking about is July kicks off Q2 earnings season and in the past 10 years overall we’ve seen a lot of doubt out there. It is likely that earnings come in better than expected, calming many of the fears and allowing for a rally. We think that could happen once again this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-2-5-800x342.png))**

&gt; Let’s be clear though, July is usually a good month in the middle of the weak summer months. The chart below shows this nicely. Since 1950, stocks gain 1.3% on average in July, but this goes up to 2.2% in the past 20 years and 3.3% in the past decade. Pre-election years are a little weaker, up 0.9%. Lastly, when stocks gain more than 3% in the usually weak June (15 times since 1950), stocks gain only 0.8% on average and are higher only 8 times. So, there could be the chance June steals some of July’s gains.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-3-3-800x338.png))**

&gt; Lastly, we’ve shared the next chart many times the past few months, as it suggested the potential for a summer rally when very few expected it. We call this the Carson Cycle Composite, as it is a proprietary indicator that combines the past 20 years, pre-election years, the third year of a new President, and years that saw stocks gain at least 5% in January (like ’23). As you can see, a rally in July is normal and we don’t believe ’23 to be any different.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-4-3-800x283.png))**

&gt; We want to be clear, at some point stocks will take a well-deserved break. August, September, and October usually can see this volatility and it very well could happen again this year. But we remain overweight equities and we’d use any seasonal weakness as an opportunity to add to core equity exposure.

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 10th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stocks tumble on Friday, notching weekly losses, as traders&amp;#39; rate hike fears return: Live updates - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks fell on Friday, and finished lower for the week, as Wall Street struggled to shake off fears that the Federal Reserve may start hiking rates again later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 lost 0.29% to end at 4,398.95, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.13% to close at 13,660.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 187.38 points, or 0.55%, to settle at 33,734.88.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three major averages capped a losing week. The S&amp;amp;P dropped 1.16%, while the Nasdaq declined 0.92%. The Dow shed 1.96% for its worst weekly performance since March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Labor Department’s June jobs report showed payrolls increased less than expected, cooling down from May. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 209,000, while the unemployment rate came in at 3.6%. Economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated 240,000 positions added and a similar jobless level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But parts of the report, including stronger-than-expected wage numbers, heightened fears that the central bank may have reason to resume hiking later this month. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.4% in June and 4.4% from a year ago. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate declined from 3.7% in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of a mixed picture today,” said Truist’s Keith Lerner. “It’s good news that the economy is not falling apart, it’s still chugging along, but you still have these wage pressures that are going to keep the Fed likely to raise rates at the end of the month.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Stellar NASDAQ 1st Half Dampens July and Q3 Performance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/2ff76af69a1691d77dc884e4bcd1c2d9/7b1ae60421497f18-3e/s500x750/e83d26bb66b714c132d4b619a7964df03e674810.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NASDAQ finished the first half of 2023 with a stellar 31.7% gain. This is NASDAQ’s third best first half ever. Only 1975 and 1983 were better. In the following table we compiled all years since 1971 when NASDAQ was up 20% or more in the first half. Reviewing the table, we observed only two times out of the past eleven where the second half of the year was better than the first half (1999 and 2003). July and Q3 were also below average following a 20%+ first half gain while Q4 was better than average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reinforces our existing tepid outlook for Q3. Today’s much stronger than anticipated jobs data has increased expectations for another Fed interest rate hike and added more uncertainty as to when the Fed will eventually pause. Increasing uncertainty is likely to lead to more volatility and a sideways to possibly lower market during the historically weak third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Big Picture: The Economy is Normalizing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started this year discussing how the economy has been at the “edge of normal” in our 2023 outlook. The good news is that we have slowly but surely moved towards normal since then, even in the face of a banking crisis and debt ceiling drama. The “soft” economic data from sentiment surveys have been poor, but the “hard” data that measure actual employment, sales, and production, have painted a much brighter picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed last month how we combine a lot of the economic data into our own proprietary leading economic index (LEI), which we produce for 30 countries around the world, each one custom-built to capture the dynamics of those economies. The individual country LEIs are also subsequently rolled up into a global index to give us a picture of the global economy. The idea is to give us an early warning signal about economic turning points. Simply put, it tells us what the economy is doing today and what it is likely to do in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, our index for the U.S. includes 20+ components, including consumer-related indicators (which make up 50% of the index), housing activity, business and manufacturing activity, as well as sentiment and financial markets data. This contrasts with other popular LEIs, which are premised on the fact that the manufacturing sector and business activity/sentiment are leading indicators of the economy. This worked well in the past but is probably not indicative of what’s happening in the economy right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, our LEI suggests the US economy is growing along trend, or slightly above it. The economic picture looks even better than it did at the end of 2022. Six months ago, the risk of recession was higher, though even then, the LEI didn’t say that we were in a recession, or even very close to one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-06-US-LEI-675x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we’re seeing some interesting dynamics under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2022 Headwinds are Fading&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, our LEI has been consistently saying that the U.S. economy is not in a recession. That was almost entirely thanks to a resilient consumer, with strong employment gains powering incomes and consumption. Pushing against this was an aggressive Federal Reserve and tighter financial conditions. Consequently, the sector that took the biggest hit last year was housing, followed by a slowdown in business spending and manufacturing activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a turnaround looks to be happening now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see below, the LEI has been rebounding over the last few months. That’s come on the back of declining headwinds from housing (yellow), business/manufacturing activity (green), and financial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-2023-07-06-LEI-breakdown-667x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, housing has moved to being a positive contributor! We’ve written about how why we believe housing will no longer be a drag on the economy after 8 straight quarters of pulling GDP growth lower. Even business activity is exerting a lower drag on the economy – we just wrote last week about how investment has been rising recently, hopefully signaling a bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial conditions appear to be easing, especially with the Fed moderating the pace of rate hikes and interest rates inching close to their terminal level for the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, consumption remains positive, though less so than a few months ago. This is not really a concern in my opinion (at least, not yet), as it simply indicates that consumption trends are normalizing. The latest contribution from consumption to our LEI is equivalent to its pre-pandemic contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the big picture is that the economy looks to be finally normalizing after a few years of being whipped around by the pandemic, and its after-effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Factory Orders Go Negative&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 24 hours have been rough for economic data both in the US and around the world as most indicators released have been weaker than expected. It started with weaker-than-expected PMI readings for the services sector in China but has since spread to weaker PMI readings for most major economies in the Eurozone as well. Here in the US, PMI data on the services sector will not be forthcoming until tomorrow morning, but Factory Orders released this morning were a big miss. At the headline level, orders for the month of May increased 0.3% which was a half percentage point below consensus expectations. Not only that but April’s reading was also revised down from growth of 0.4% down to 0.3%. After stripping out Transportation, Factory Orders declined 0.5% while April’s reading was revised from a decline of 0.2% down to a drop of 0.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a year/year basis, Factory Orders also dipped into negative territory for the first time since October 2020. The chart below shows the historical y/y change in Factory Orders since 1960. While readings were negative during every recession, there were plenty of other periods where they also declined on a y/y basis and the economy was nowhere near a recession. Not only that but there were also many other periods during economic expansions where Factory Orders dropped by a much larger amount on a y/y basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the magnitude of the decline in Factory Orders hasn’t been extreme, what is unique about the current period is how long the rate of change in Factory Orders has been declining. The chart below shows streaks where the y/y change in Factory Orders increased (blue line) or declined (red line). With May’s report, the rate of change in Factory Orders on a year/year basis has declined for a record eight straight months, breaking the prior record of seven months that was seen during recessions in the mid-1970s, early 1980s, and during the Financial Crisis. The fact that prior streaks of similar duration all occurred during recessions isn’t exactly reassuring. What makes it less worrisome, though, is that the decline is coming after Durable Goods experienced record growth and consistency of growth coming out of the COVID crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s plenty of evidence out there to cite as reasons why the US economy is teetering on the edge of a recession or merely in a slowdown, and parts of today&amp;#39;s Factory Orders report could honestly be used to help justify either viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Why July Brings the Bulls&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am an optimist because I don’t see the point in being anything else.” -Abraham Lincoln&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that, the first half of the year is a wrap. What can we say other than all those calls for a recession and new bear market lows sure didn’t play out. We were one of the only places predicting there wouldn’t be a recession this year and to look for stocks to possibly gain 12-15% (and maybe more with some good news). It was a lonely call and we took a lot of heat for it, but we are noticing more and more shops are coming over to the no-recession camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noted in Why a Sunny Second Half of 2023 is Likely some reasons to expect more gains after the big start to this year. Well, here’s another angle on that. I looked at all the years that were up more than 10% at the midpoint of the year, but were also negative the year before. In other words, a potential slingshot move. Sure enough, stocks did even better when this took place, with the S&amp;amp;P 500 higher those final six months eight out of nine times and up a median of 12.4% – well above the median final six month return of 7.7% when those first six months gain more than 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, can this surprise summer rally continue? As Honest Abe would say, might as well be an optimist and we think it can, as July historically is a strong month. Of course, it isn’t just about seasonals, as the realization the economy may not be going into a recession and a Fed that is likely done hiking are both also positives, which should keep things moving higher in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, stocks have gained 9 of the past 10 years in July, with no month sporting a better average return over the past decade than the 3.3% July gain for the S&amp;amp;P 500. Why is this you ask? The one thing I keep thinking about is July kicks off Q2 earnings season and in the past 10 years overall we’ve seen a lot of doubt out there. It is likely that earnings come in better than expected, calming many of the fears and allowing for a rally. We think that could happen once again this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear though, July is usually a good month in the middle of the weak summer months. The chart below shows this nicely. Since 1950, stocks gain 1.3% on average in July, but this goes up to 2.2% in the past 20 years and 3.3% in the past decade. Pre-election years are a little weaker, up 0.9%. Lastly, when stocks gain more than 3% in the usually weak June (15 times since 1950), stocks gain only 0.8% on average and are higher only 8 times. So, there could be the chance June steals some of July’s gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we’ve shared the next chart many times the past few months, as it suggested the potential for a summer rally when very few expected it. We call this the Carson Cycle Composite, as it is a proprietary indicator that combines the past 20 years, pre-election years, the third year of a new President, and years that saw stocks gain at least 5% in January (like ’23). As you can see, a rally in July is normal and we don’t believe ’23 to be any different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to be clear, at some point stocks will take a well-deserved break. August, September, and October usually can see this volatility and it very well could happen again this year. But we remain overweight equities and we’d use any seasonal weakness as an opportunity to add to core equity exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

Investing is one of those strange things where the more research you do and the more trades you make, the worse you tend to do.  Women tend to outperform men simply because they are more likely to just buy and hold.  In fact, in one study the demographic that performed the best was those who had passed away, since they were unable to make any trades.  The sooner that you realize how difficult it is to time the market successfully, the better your performance will be.

As always, I recommend a DCA strategy into market ETF's and hold long term.

Women tend to outperform men simply because they are more likely to just buy and hold.  In fact, in one study the demographic that performed the best was those who had passed away, since they were unable to make any trades.  The sooner that you realize how difficult it is to time the market successfully, the better your performance will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, I recommend a DCA strategy into market ETF&amp;#39;s and hold long term.&lt;/p&gt;

737,stocks,"I am still in the process of gathering more information and writing the long-form post that I do once a week, but I thought to share some quick insights.

I think **Zoom ($ZM)** is in trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

Zoom benefited significantly from the pandemic, as the demand for its products surged. The revenue growth in 2020 was 88%, followed by 326% in 2021 and still an impressive 55% in 2022.

*\*Fiscal years ending January*

However, the pandemic is behind us, and so is Zoom’s growth. During the fiscal year 2023, the revenue was up $293 million (roughly 7%). But this isn’t the bad news. To understand what is actually happening, we need to take a look at the operating expenses, especially one group - **Selling &amp; Marketing.**

The purpose of this expense is self-explanatory.

Well, it increased from $1.1 billion to a whopping $1.7 billion in 2023 (from 28% to 39% of revenue).

Let me make it clear, Zoom spent $1.7 billion on Selling &amp; Marketing, and increased its top line by less than $300 million!

This is the simplified conclusion. The reality is a bit more complex. The $1.7 billion brought a lot more revenue, not only the net increase. What we’re missing in this equation is the revenue that was lost during the year, due to cancellation of the Zoom plans. Although this doesn’t exist as a separate data point, it is quite clear that the management decided to focus on not reporting revenue loss during the year by doubling down on Selling &amp; Marketing.

However, this has an impact on its margins.

This increased expenditure reduced their operating margin to roughly 6% from 25% in the previous two years.

The response that many will have is: *“So, all the company needs to do is, reduce the Selling &amp; Marketing expense, and their profitability will go up, right?”*

Well, profitability, in terms of higher margins, is likely. However, it will come hand in hand with lower revenue. 

Zoom is not only not a growth company at this moment, but also one where the management needs to decide between keeping its market share and actually delivering returns to the shareholders.

#[Stock futures are little changed as investors look toward Friday jobs report: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Friday morning, as investors refocused their attention on the upcoming June jobs report and the implications for the Federal Reserve’s policy stance.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 futures were flat. Nasdaq-100 futures slipped by 0.2%. Levi Strauss shares tumbled 7% as the denim giant cut its profit outlook for the year.
*****
&gt; This week’s main event for economic data looms ahead: the Labor Department’s June payrolls report, which is due Friday morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones anticipate an increase of 240,000 positions, a cooldown from May’s gain of 339,000 jobs.
*****
&gt; Investors are on high alert for signs that the central bank will tighten policy even further. Traders now forecast a 91% chance the Fed will raise rates at its July meeting, according to the FedWatch tool from CME Group. Policymakers indicated at their June gathering that two more rate hikes could be ahead in 2023.
*****
&gt; “The Fed is signaling a willingness to keep tightening, but markets aren’t convinced it will happen as much as the Fed projects,” Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research, wrote in a bond market update. “The gap between the peak rate implied by the dot plot and market expectations has narrowed but hasn’t closed.”
*****
&gt; The major averages slipped Thursday after data from ADP showed that private sector employers added 497,000 jobs in June. That figure far exceeded the 220,000 estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones.

&gt; The ADP results spurred worries about the Fed’s next steps. Bond yields spiked during regular trading Thursday, with the rate on the 2-year Treasury — which is most sensitive to the central bank’s policy —touching its highest level since 2007. Stocks also fell, as the 30-stock Dow shed more than 1%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite slid about 0.8% each.
*****
&gt; The three major averages are on their way to a losing week. The S&amp;P 500 is off by about 0.9%, while the Nasdaq is on pace for a 0.8% decline. The Dow is the underperformer of the three, tracking for a 1.4% loss.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent final trading day of this week ahead today on this Friday, July 7th, 2023! :)**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Good Friday morning traders and investors of the &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; sub! Welcome to the final trading day of the week. Here are your pre-market movers &amp;amp; news on this Friday, July the 7th, 2023-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;Stock futures are little changed as investors look toward Friday jobs report: Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock futures were little changed Friday morning, as investors refocused their attention on the upcoming June jobs report and the implications for the Federal Reserve’s policy stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;amp;P 500 futures were flat. Nasdaq-100 futures slipped by 0.2%. Levi Strauss shares tumbled 7% as the denim giant cut its profit outlook for the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s main event for economic data looms ahead: the Labor Department’s June payrolls report, which is due Friday morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones anticipate an increase of 240,000 positions, a cooldown from May’s gain of 339,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are on high alert for signs that the central bank will tighten policy even further. Traders now forecast a 91% chance the Fed will raise rates at its July meeting, according to the FedWatch tool from CME Group. Policymakers indicated at their June gathering that two more rate hikes could be ahead in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Fed is signaling a willingness to keep tightening, but markets aren’t convinced it will happen as much as the Fed projects,” Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research, wrote in a bond market update. “The gap between the peak rate implied by the dot plot and market expectations has narrowed but hasn’t closed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major averages slipped Thursday after data from ADP showed that private sector employers added 497,000 jobs in June. That figure far exceeded the 220,000 estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ADP results spurred worries about the Fed’s next steps. Bond yields spiked during regular trading Thursday, with the rate on the 2-year Treasury — which is most sensitive to the central bank’s policy —touching its highest level since 2007. Stocks also fell, as the 30-stock Dow shed more than 1%. The S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite slid about 0.8% each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three major averages are on their way to a losing week. The S&amp;amp;P 500 is off by about 0.9%, while the Nasdaq is on pace for a 0.8% decline. The Dow is the underperformer of the three, tracking for a 1.4% loss.&lt;/p&gt;

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

&gt;Embracer raises $182 million via share issue

&gt;The group issued 80,000 new shares and revised its net debt target to SEK 8 billion ($729 million) by the end of FY2023-24

&gt;Embracer has raised SEK 2 billion ($182 million) by issuing 80,000 new shares.

&gt;The share issue targeted Swedish and international institutional investors, the company said in its announcement, with a subscription price of SEK 25 (roughly $2.25) per share.

&gt;In a release published prior to the share issue yesterday, Embracer said that upon completion the initiative will help the company revise its net debt target to SEK 8 billion ($729 million) at the end of FY2023-24.

&gt;CEO Lars Wingefors commented: ""The operational and financial performance of the business remains on track according to the management expectations driven by a strong performance of the Dead Island 2 during the first quarter of 2023. The execution of the restructuring program communicated on June 13, 2023 goes according to plan. The company hereby reiterates its full year Adjusted EBIT forecast of SEK 7-9 billion."" ($638-821 million)

&gt;Embracer clarified that it preferred a share issue rather than a rights issue as the latter ""in the current market would entail a risk that the company cannot provide for its capital needs while maintaining its desired optimal capital structure.""

&gt;A rights issue would also expose the company to a risk of ""a significant depressed share price,"" Embracer added, saying that a share issue was ""the most suitable alternative.""

&gt;Wingefors said: ""The strong support from both existing and new investors in this share issue proves a firm belief in Embracer Group’s strategy to become a stronger company by unleashing the significant untapped potential in the group.

&gt;""While the restructuring program is developing according to plan, the proceeds from this share issue will further strengthen our financial position, improving both financing cost and our operational flexibility, and enabling us to focus on the key aspects of the program. Ultimately, this will empower our entrepreneurs and creators to continue to deliver outstanding and memorable experiences to gamers and fans across the globe.""

&gt;Embracer announced a restructuring program mid-June as its debt reached SEK 15.6 billion ($1.45 billion) as of March 31, 2023.

&gt;The program led to leadership changes, with Saber CEO Matthew Karch resigning to become the firm's COO, and Crystal Dynamics' Phil Rogers named chief strategy officer.

&gt;In its financial results for FY2022-23, Embracer's sales were up 79% year-on-year but Wingefors described the 12-month period as ""challenging"" as a $2 billion deal collapsed due to ""external factors.""

&gt;Last week, SJN Insight's Sam Naji reflected on the group's restructure announcement, and pondered whether the IP Embracer owns can fortify its future.

# [Stock futures fall Thursday as traders assess Fed rate outlook: Live update](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday as Wall Street resumed a holiday-shortened week and awaited Federal Reserve meeting minutes coming in the afternoon.
*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Thursday following a losing session on Wall Street, as traders continued to weigh the outlook for Federal Reserve monetary policy.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 153 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.4% along with Nasdaq-100 futures.
*****
&gt; JetBlue Airways slipped 1.2% in the premarket after the company announced it would end its partnership in the northeast U.S. with American Airlines to focus on Spirit Airlines. American shares moved 1.6% lower, while Spirit added 2.9%.
*****
&gt; The shortened trading week resumed Wednesday after a break for the Fourth of July holiday. The major indexes logged modest losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 129.83 points, or 0.38%, while the S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.2%. Both indexes snapped three-day win streaks. The Nasdaq Composite finished 0.18% lower.
*****
&gt; Wall Street also combed through minutes from June’s Federal Reserve policy meeting, where members opted to skip a hike. The latest findings showed that most officials would support more increases ahead.
*****
&gt; As of late Wednesday, traders are pricing in a nearly 89% chance of a hike at the central bank’s meeting this month, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; “Fed chair Powell has made it clear that he is absolutely committed to seeing this 2% target reached, and so, I think it pretty much means that it’s a when, not an if, as far as additional hikes are concerned later this year,” CIC Wealth’s Malcolm Ethridge said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; He said he expects two more hikes from the Fed this year, likely in the third quarter. Ethridge, executive vice president at CIC Wealth, also noted that while inflation’s showing signs of cooling it will take time to reach the 2% target.
*****
&gt; “No matter which side you fall on, we can all sort of agree that not enough has meaningfully broken to this point that would signal that they’re going to back off of the gas pedal and allow us to coast from here,” he added.
*****
&gt; Given this setup, investors aggressively positioned in this market for their time horizon or risk appetite may want to use periods of strength to take profits, he said.
*****
&gt; The shortened trading week continues Thursday with a slew of fresh economic data points, including ADP private payrolls data for June and initial jobless claims. A reading of S&amp;P Global services PMI and ISM services PMI are also on deck.

776,stocks,"Does this trend change the mind of an investor to lean on the side of Fintech Banks vs Traditional Banks?  Which side would you invest more in and why?

A recent study by Cornerstone Advisors showed the increasing trend of Americans opening Fintech checking accounts:

* In the first half of 2023, Fintech/Digital Banks captured nearly half (47%) of all new checking accounts.
* Fintech/Digital Banks' growth is coming at the expense of large banks.
* Chime and PayPal represent 20% of all new checking accounts opened in 2023.
* In the first half of 2023, SoFi’s market share quadrupled to 4% from 1% in 2020 while Wells Fargo’s share dropped by more than a half to 3.5%.
* Young Americans dominate new checking accounts opening in 2023 with 72% being Gen Zers or Millennials

The article continues by emphasizing the trend of more percentage of Americans opening new checking accounts.  Megabanks may not feel the pain as they have more affluent consumers and many may have more than one checking account.  However, the article goes further and stated that megabanks should feel the pain because the percentage of consumers using them as their primary checking account provider is on a decline.  This declining trend spreads to regional banks, community banks, and credit unions as they all are losing their share of being Americans' primary banking providers.

Apparently, more than a third of Gen Z and Millennials, and nearly thirty percent of Gen X consider Fintech/Digital Bank as their primary checking account provider.  The reasons for this Fintech/digital trend are:

1. Young consumers pay with many available digital methods.
2. Fintech/Digital Banks offer a multitude of products within their ""checking account.""
3. The Fintech/Digital Banks often offer more metrics to measure financial health and performance.
4. The percentage of assets spent on marketing is much higher by the Fintech/Digital Banks for brand awareness.

&lt;li&gt;Chime and PayPal represent 20% of all new checking accounts opened in 2023.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the first half of 2023, SoFi’s market share quadrupled to 4% from 1% in 2020 while Wells Fargo’s share dropped by more than a half to 3.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young Americans dominate new checking accounts opening in 2023 with 72% being Gen Zers or Millennials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article continues by emphasizing the trend of more percentage of Americans opening new checking accounts.  Megabanks may not feel the pain as they have more affluent consumers and many may have more than one checking account.  However, the article goes further and stated that megabanks should feel the pain because the percentage of consumers using them as their primary checking account provider is on a decline.  This declining trend spreads to regional banks, community banks, and credit unions as they all are losing their share of being Americans&amp;#39; primary banking providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, more than a third of Gen Z and Millennials, and nearly thirty percent of Gen X consider Fintech/Digital Bank as their primary checking account provider.  The reasons for this Fintech/digital trend are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young consumers pay with many available digital methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fintech/Digital Banks offer a multitude of products within their &amp;quot;checking account.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Fintech/Digital Banks often offer more metrics to measure financial health and performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The percentage of assets spent on marketing is much higher by the Fintech/Digital Banks for brand awareness.&lt;/li&gt;

Brokerage account A is for my long term investing (just in VOO and QQQM). I throw $300 into it every paycheck and have for years. This is my set it an forget it account. This account will someday be almost for sure worth a lot more than it is. Brokerage account B is for trading and I like to swing trade (I never day trade). I will wait for extremes in the market (i.e. in March 2020 I bought up Wayfair and Amazon stocks due to the lockdowns and people buying from home being the norm for awhile). 

I have a Brokerage account C that is only dividend paying ETFs but I am not going to talk about that account right now on here. I opened up both brokerage accounts A and B in 2017 when I began to have throw money available. An almost down to the dollar amount has been added to both brokerage accounts. Are you ready for the rate of return comparison? Before I give it I want to say a few things: Brokerage account A took me less than 2 hours of research to decide which 2 ETFs to throw my money in. This is again just investing in 2 ETFs (VOO and QQQM). I click ""market"" and then ""buy"" and I purchase as much of these 2 ETFs equally as quickly as I can when I get a paycheck and have money left over. This takes no time at all. Brokerage account B has probably taken me hundreds of hours of research, I have lost sleep (both because of having really good days and really bad days - like when I bought NIO 16 months ago). 

Rate of return of brokerage account A since 2017 (average year over year return): 6.1% 

Rate of return of brokerage account B since 2017 (average year over year return): 6.2% 

That is it. All of the hundreds of hours of starting at Finviz screens. All of the times of comparing a stock to another stocks PE, forward PE, company debt, etc etc has yielded me a 0.1% difference to the upside. If I could go back in time I would have been better off just throwing money into brokerage account A. One of the reasons I have not done better in account B is because there are many talking heads out there who swore we would be in a recession, akin to 2008 (25% - 30% down from all time highs). It reminds me of the many talking heads in 2010, then in 2011, then in 2012, then again in 2013 who swore we would have a double dip recession and that the rally in 2009-2010 was inflated.

I use Fidelity, hoping responses can be in the context to how they post wash sales. 

10 shares of AMZN are sold for a loss of $1 each, $10 total loss. 

10 shares more are purchased same day resulting in a wash sale. These purchases show a W and the cost value has an added $1/ share 

If you continue to buy 10 more shares, these also show a W and the cost value goes up $1/share. 

In this example, your loss on sale was $10 but fidelity is showing a total added cost of $20 on the 20 stocks you purchased.

My question is, for the 30 day period that the was sale exists post sale - do I have to pay a higher amount on every share I purchased? Or will the total loss be averaged out across the total amount of shares that were purchased during this period?

&lt;p&gt;I use Fidelity, hoping responses can be in the context to how they post wash sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 shares of AMZN are sold for a loss of $1 each, $10 total loss. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 shares more are purchased same day resulting in a wash sale. These purchases show a W and the cost value has an added $1/ share &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you continue to buy 10 more shares, these also show a W and the cost value goes up $1/share. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, your loss on sale was $10 but fidelity is showing a total added cost of $20 on the 20 stocks you purchased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, for the 30 day period that the was sale exists post sale - do I have to pay a higher amount on every share I purchased? Or will the total loss be averaged out across the total amount of shares that were purchased during this period? &lt;/p&gt;

I put a market order in for a number of SPY contracts expiring next week that were hedging my long position over the weekend.  The price at the time was 2.30.  TDAmeritrade was showing wacky Bid-Ask spreads (Asks higher than the Bid).  The issue was caused by Nasdaq-PHLX which had a stale price and an overall processing issue.  I guess my market order was routed there and failed to execute.  I saw the position was not executing and so i put in another order and received a cannot execute on the position.  I immediately called Ameritrade and was given a bunch of non-clear statements on their playbook and what I should do.  In total, I could not execute the transaction for about 25 minutes and the price deteriorated against me during that period.  They are taking no responsibility and calling my attempts pointless.  They are saying that the issue was at the exchange and there was nothing I could do besides calling the exchange - why would the exchange do anything since I have no agreement with them.  In any event, I have 2 issues with my situation, why are they routing to an exchange that obviously has a stale and inaccurate bid/ask - they should have controls in place to not allow trades being routed to an exchange being failed.  Separately, why could I not execute for 25 minutes?  The issue at the exchange was a total of 7 minutes 942 AM ET to 949 AM ET.  

Does anyone have any suggestions on recourse or advice on what I can do?  This should not happen on their platform and they know it.  Even if an exchange goes down, it should be auto-rerouted.  Separately, I should not be left clueless.  Let me know if anyone can help.  This is my second big issue with TDA in the past two months.  I am probably leaving them after this incident.

# [Stock futures fall as investors await Fed meeting minutes: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday as Wall Street resumed a holiday-shortened week and awaited Federal Reserve meeting minutes coming in the afternoon.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 160 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Markets were closed Tuesday for the Fourth of July holiday. They closed early Monday.
*****
&gt; Minutes from the June 13-14 Fed meeting due Wednesday afternoon could provide more details on where monetary policy is heading. While the decision to hold interest rates steady was not a surprise, indications that members see at least two more hikes before the end of the year did catch the market off guard. Since then, policymakers have provided further indications that they see more work ahead before inflation is brought back down to an acceptable level.
*****
&gt; Traders are also watching for May factory orders data out Wednesday after the market open. Economists polled by Dow Jones are anticipating a rise of 0.6%, which would be greater than the 0.4% increase the previous month.
*****
&gt; New York Fed President John Williams is expected to speak at 4 p.m. ET at the 2023 Annual Meeting of the Central Bank Research Association in New York City.
*****
&gt; Investors are coming off a positive session Monday, which kicked off the start of a new month, quarter and half-year for traders. Stocks rose slightly during the shortened trading day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 10.87 points, or 0.03%. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.12%, while the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.21% higher.
*****
&gt; Those gains built on a strong start to the year. Last week, the Nasdaq closed out its best first half of the year since 1983, while the S&amp;P 500 notched its best first-half advance since 2019, as a surge in interest in artificial intelligence buoyed investor optimism in stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the laggard, rising just 3.8%.

Trying to understand and exploit the ebb and flow among sectors. Attempting to identify where long-term accumulation is taking place. First and foremost I watch SPY/QQQ/IWM, ES/NQ/RTY, VIX/VX, DXY/USD, and the 10Y. I also watch the SPDR Sector Funds like XLK, XLF, XLV, XLU, XLY, XLE, XLP, XBI, etc. Additionally, IWC (micro-caps) and IJH (mid-caps). 

And VTI (whole stock market ETF) and VT (whole world market ETF) I watch on the weekly chart to get a sense for where the world markets are trending in general. I haven't branched into other markets much, mainly focused on identifying 

1) where the current strength in the market is 

2) whether the market is remaining orderly/non-volatile 

3) how much divergence is taking place among sectors/stocks (e.g. last year felt like indiscriminate selling, this year the divergences are tremendous)

For individual stocks, I basically rifle through stocks with setups that interest me and I really lack organization for what I have on my charts during a trading day.

It's been a challenge to manage my screen real estate and I still change things up all the time, haven't found a solid methodology I guess for what I have pulled up. Undoubtedly what you have pulled up can effect what you trade, how you perceive the market throughout the day, etc. 

A lot of times I have AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, AMZN, up at all times. From there I have a mix of stocks from other sectors, maybe a couple wildcards like a small cap/squeeze name.

801,stocks,"IBM revealed that it would pay $4.6 billion to Vista Equity Partners to buy the software business Apptio.The business said that IBM's investment in AI and IT automation software is being continued with the purchase of Apptio, which provides financial and operational IT monitoring and optimisation solutions. Apptio will help IBM develop its application management, optimisation, and observability solutions, the company claimed in a release.  
Based on Reuters, Apptio’s revenue is about $233m in 2018, and an annual compound of 10% would lead to an estimated revenue of slightly more than $300m. IBM has paid for 15 times Price to Sales Ratio for Apptio’s business, and it seems to be an overpayment given that their revenue generation is only $300m. Furthermore, it is not disclosed on whether Apptio is profitable and generating free cash flow. For comparison, PE firm Vista Equity Partners agreed to acquire Apptio for $1.94 billion in 2018, and IBM has paid for more than twice of that amount in the span of 5 years. This would amount to 1-2% of IBM’s market cap which shows that the acquisition is slightly material to business, especially since it is an all-cash acquisition.  
Considering that it is an all-cash acquisition by IBM, it makes one wonder whether the cash could have been put to better use, instead of overpaying for Apptio. Nevertheless, the CEO of IBM believes that Apptio's offerings combined with IBM's IT automation software and watsonx AI platform, gives clients the most comprehensive approach to optimize and manage all of their technology investments.   
Historically, IBM does not have a good track record of their acquisitions. An example would be their acquisition of Weather Co for $2bn in 2015. Currently, there are rumours that IBM is looking to sell their Weather business, with an estimated valuation of $1bn. This leads to a negative loss of $1bn, and it also shows that the acquisition did not went well.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Twice the size, 27% cheaper.

One of the main reasons for this is the negative sentiment around the company due to the increased competition (Google Pay, Apple Pay, Stripe, etc. ) and the expectations that the future of PayPal isn't as bright as its past was. I think this is a fair concern and should not be ignored.

I describe PayPal as a fintech company, that offers solutions related to online financial transactions, digital wallets, and revolving credit. Of course, there are plenty of other solutions that are part of the portfolio, but if we take a look at the revenue stream, it is quite clear where the value comes from:

\- Transaction revenues **(91%)**

\- Other value-added services **(9%)**

In my opinion, there are 3 important variables to understand how PayPal's ability to generate revenue changes over time:

1. Number of users
2. Number of transactions per user
3. Average transaction size

The higher these numbers are, the more revenue PayPal has.

&amp;#x200B;

**The formula**

I went back to 2014, and the data is quite clear, the management has done an outstanding job and despite the competition, PayPal continues to grow:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The number of users is up from 161 million to 435 million.
2. The number of transactions per user is up from 24 to 53.
3. The average transaction size remains at $60.

&amp;#x200B;

In the most recent year, the growth comes less from user growth and more from an increase in # of transactions per user.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical financial performance &amp; the acquisitions effect**

The revenue in the last twelve months (ending March 2023) is up 58% compared to the full 2019 (less than 5 years ago). Although the gross margin has decreased from 45% to 42%, the operating margin stands at 15%, as the operating expenses have decreased (as % of revenue).

However, I will argue that this profitability is understated due to the acquisitions that they've done.

PayPal is no stranger to acquiring companies to improve its ecosystem and of course, some have performed better than others. However, to understand the impact on the company's profitability, let's take the acquisition of ""Honey"" back in 2020.

PayPal paid $3.6 billion for it and here's what it got on its balance sheet in return:

1. Goodwill $3 billion
2. Customer lists and user base $0.1 billion
3. Marketing-related technology $30 million
4. Developed technology $0.6 billion
5. Receivables, deferred tax liabilities, other net liabilities -$0.1 billion

What does this mean and why is this important? When a company is being acquired, in most cases, there are certain intangible assets that arise. In this case, I am referring to points 2, 3, and 4. These assets weren't on the balance sheet of Honey, as they are internally generated, and the accounting standards do not allow for capitalization (Otherwise, everyone would do it, which would lead to overstating the profitability).

These intangible assets will be amortized in the income statement of PayPal over a certain period of time. From an accounting point of view, this is a non-cash expense throughout the amortization period. However, PayPal is not going to invest in order to replace them. The customer lists will remain there, and so will the technology. This accounting expense doesn't exist from a cash point of view.

This is how much amortization of this kind was in PayPal's financials over the last 3 years:

2020: $451 million

2021: $443 million

2022: $471 million

These amounts represent roughly 2% of PayPal's revenue.

So the operating profit is actually closer to 17%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Returning cash to the shareholders**

As PayPal is a profitable cash-generating company, one of the questions that need to be asked is - What do they do with all the cash?

Well, other than acquisitions. The answer is - share buybacks. The # of shares outstanding continues to decrease every year, as PayPal buys back more shares than its share-based compensation. The company will spend $3.5 billion until the end of 2023, and there's $14.4 billion in total remaining from the existing buyback program (20% of the outstanding shares).

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumptions and valuation**

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my assumptions for the future:

**Revenue growth**: 7% per year over the next 2 years, then declining over time to 4%. With this assumption, revenue in 10 years' time increases by 64%.

**Operating margin**: 16% (slightly lower than the operating margin that the company has at the moment)

**Discount rate**: 10.1% decreasing to 9.3% over time

You might wonder, what about the competitive landscape? My expected growth is much lower than the 15% CAGR over the last 5 years. In addition, the operating margin of 16% is lower than the 16.7% operating margin that PayPal has today (adjusted for the amortization mentioned above).

After adjusting for what is on their balance sheet, as well as the equity options outstanding, the value of PayPal is roughly **$71.4 billion ($63.99/share).**

For comparison, today’s market cap is $74.5 billion ($66.73/share), which is quite close.

The **expected IRR** based on my assumptions is 9.3%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**

The future is uncertain and my assumptions could be significantly wrong. Let's take a look at how the valuation (per share) changes if we use different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue / Operating margin|14%|16%|18%|20%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|50% ($42.1b)|$52.9|$59.6|$66.2|$71.7|
|64% ($46.1b)|$56.7|$64.0|$71.3|$77.2|
|100% ($56.2b)|$64.5|$73.1|$81.6|$88.9|
|125% ($63.2b)|$70.3|$79.8|$89.3|$97.4|

The sentiment around PayPal seems to be negative as the share price is down a lot. The fear of their competitors taking their lunch is still around, but it isn't reflected in the financials. Based on all of this, I decided to open a position in the company, and should it drop further, I'll buy more.

&lt;p&gt;The higher these numbers are, the more revenue PayPal has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to 2014, and the data is quite clear, the management has done an outstanding job and despite the competition, PayPal continues to grow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The number of transactions per user is up from 24 to 53.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average transaction size remains at $60.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the most recent year, the growth comes less from user growth and more from an increase in # of transactions per user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historical financial performance &amp;amp; the acquisitions effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revenue in the last twelve months (ending March 2023) is up 58% compared to the full 2019 (less than 5 years ago). Although the gross margin has decreased from 45% to 42%, the operating margin stands at 15%, as the operating expenses have decreased (as % of revenue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I will argue that this profitability is understated due to the acquisitions that they&amp;#39;ve done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPal is no stranger to acquiring companies to improve its ecosystem and of course, some have performed better than others. However, to understand the impact on the company&amp;#39;s profitability, let&amp;#39;s take the acquisition of &amp;quot;Honey&amp;quot; back in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPal paid $3.6 billion for it and here&amp;#39;s what it got on its balance sheet in return:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodwill $3 billion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer lists and user base $0.1 billion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing-related technology $30 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developed technology $0.6 billion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Receivables, deferred tax liabilities, other net liabilities -$0.1 billion&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These intangible assets will be amortized in the income statement of PayPal over a certain period of time. From an accounting point of view, this is a non-cash expense throughout the amortization period. However, PayPal is not going to invest in order to replace them. The customer lists will remain there, and so will the technology. This accounting expense doesn&amp;#39;t exist from a cash point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how much amortization of this kind was in PayPal&amp;#39;s financials over the last 3 years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020: $451 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021: $443 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022: $471 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These amounts represent roughly 2% of PayPal&amp;#39;s revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the operating profit is actually closer to 17%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returning cash to the shareholders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As PayPal is a profitable cash-generating company, one of the questions that need to be asked is - What do they do with all the cash?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, other than acquisitions. The answer is - share buybacks.

Ballooning debt in the coming years will force the Federal Reserve to buy massive amounts of bonds again, according to Michael Howell, managing director at Crossborder Capital.

Writing in The Financial Times on Wednesday, he predicted that the central bank will have to abandon its quantitative tightening plan, which would roll back prior stimulus by shrinking the Fed's balance sheet. Instead, the Fed will return to its quantitative easing scheme, lifting stocks in the process, he added.

""Investors should therefore expect a continuing tailwind from global liquidity instead of last year's severe headwinds. This should prove good for stocks, but less positive for bond investors,"" Howell said.

Despite forecasts of a looming funding drain, the liquidity cycle has already passed its bottom and will trend up over the coming years, he said.

Howell noted that the Fed and other central banks earlier this year plowed liquidity into the global financial system during this spring's banking turmoil, which was caused by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

""But in coming years they will probably have to bailout debt-burdened governments, too,"" he warned.

According to Howell, about seven in every eight dollars churning through global markets are already used for debt refinancing. And of the remaining dollar, a growing portion is going toward expanding government deficits.

That's as developed economies are being faced with fresh pressure to expand public spending, as a renewed focus on military requirements and changing demographics weigh on budgets, he explained.

""In a world of excessive debt, large central bank balance sheets are a necessity. So, forget QT, quantitative easing is coming back. The pool of global liquidity — which we estimate to be about $170 trillion — is not going to shrink significantly any time soon,"" he wrote.

According to Congressional Budget Office estimates cited by Howell, the Fed's Treasury holdings would have to rise to $7.5 trillion by 2033 from nearly $5 trillion today.

But he thinks that forecast is too low.

""More realistic numbers point to required Fed Treasury holdings of at least $10 trillion. That translates pro rata into a doubling of its current $8.5 trillion balance sheet size and will mean several years of double-digit growth in Fed liquidity,"" he wrote.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think?

Now it is approaching it again, and ***Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman***, who has long focused on [Apple’s business strategy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-06-30/apple-s-aapl-near-3-trillion-valuation-isn-t-about-the-vision-pro-headset), provides an analysis that reveals the reasons behind this trend. At first glance, it may seem that investors believe in the revolutionary Vision Pro headset, but the opposite is true.  
AR/VR glasses like Vision Pro will not become as popular as iPhones or MacBooks when they are launched. The high price, impractical external battery, and the still unclear practical use of this headset will be the cause. Apple is aware of this, as are the investors who rely on other products.

**What Drives The Increase In Stock Prices?**  
As the first reason, Gurman mentions Apple’s user interface. The integration of all mobile devices, tablets, watches, and the availability of music and video subscriptions on every product is extremely convenient, making it hard to leave this ecosystem. In the case of Apple, customers are simply willing to pay extra for the luxury that the brand offers.  
Another aspect is the fact that a new series of iPhones, the [**iPhone 15**](https://afronomist.com/what-are-the-side-buttons-on-the-new-iphone-15-pro-like/), will be released in the fall, bringing more significant changes and new features after a while. Investors expect that the new models will attract many customers, driving the company’s value upward.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of Apple is starting to rise towards the historic record of $3 trillion, which it has already surpassed once in history. This is likely happening in connection with the recent WWDC 2023, where promising products such as Vision Pro were introduced. However, the hot news of this AR/VR headset is not what drives up the company&amp;#39;s stock price. Mark Gurman offers a different explanation.  &lt;/p&gt;

I am a writer trying to outline the plot of my next novel. I find that reddit is the best place to find answers to complicated subjects I know nothing about. My knowledge of the stock market is confined to what I've seen on Billions and the Wolf of Wall Street etc. Forgive me my ignorance.

I'm looking for a reason that a CEO would intentionally sabotage and subsequently tank/bankrupt his own company.

Hypothetical: Company A is testing a brand new technology. Due to new fictitious law, the test of this technology must be successful, or the patent for said technology becomes open to other companies.

I want Company A's CEO to sabotage the test, intentionally shuttering company A, take the open patent and miniaturise the technology through company B and make billions on the commercial market.

He can't do it through company A because he would be sharing the profit three ways with the two inventors of the technology.

My question. Can the CEO, through multiple clandestine firms, short the stock of his own company, prior to sabotaging the test. Will this result in a major windfall to him? Is he also able to take insurance on his stock (hedging I believe) prior to the inevitable stock plummet post test failure.

I hope this is all making sense. If not, how could it? I'm looking for a better understanding and maybe some better lingo to use to get my point across. Remember, it doesn't have to be 100% accurate, it's fiction, it just needs to be accurate enough to be believable and entertaining. 

Hope someone can help me out. Thanks guys.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Reddit, please delete if this is not allowed. &lt;/p&gt;

839,stocks,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

My father sold 24 shares of LRCX at 641 on nasdaq almost a month ago with about 50% profit. He did it via a reputable broker of the biggest bank in my country(small EU nation) as he has done several times.

&amp;#x200B;

He didnt check his transactional account after the trade was made and after he got a confirmation of the order and later trade invoice which was the same as always. Today, of all days, we(im his son) noticed that the money isn't there altough the date of the settlement was june 13th.

We called the bank call center where he has his trading and transactional account and they said the money hasnt arrived on the 13th or any later date. The brokerage of this bank where we will get the info isnt available during the weekend, so im just so nervous and would like you to help me or put me at ease at what might have happened here before we contact them asap on monday.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think the money is still on the brokerage joint custodian account as he has no written agreement for the money to be left there and the contract on the invoice clearly states the settlement date is 13th and that the money will be trasnfered to his transactional account immediately after that.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think there was a failure to deliver payment on the part of the buyer and the trade failed? if so, he still owns the shares right? Why was there no notification of this from the brokerage which is otherwise top notch? How often do FTD happen in retail trade???

&amp;#x200B;

What else do you think could have happened. I might sound foolish but he(we - im his son) has traded enough with this brokerage and something like this has never happened before.

843,stocks,"Enovix is a Silicon Valley company creating next gen battery tech that will power technologies of the future, including everything from smart watches to VR goggles and EVs (eventually). How many products can benefit from a better battery?

The company is led by a team of semiconductor industry veterans with tons of experience in scaling manufacturing and growing companies. 

The Board is led by TJ Rodgers from $ENPH fame and the board is convinced that creating a better battery is one the next large challenges that tech needs to solve, is prime for disruption, and they are dedicated to take on the challenge.

Enovix has been doing R&amp;D for 10+ years and they are finally ready to start mass producing their batteries.

They have lots of large customers in the pipeline and they just announced a purchase order from a supplier for the US Army which is why the price increased this week.

Investors are waiting for more press releases such as manufacturing updates, additional POs, etc. 

The company is pre-profit and the reason I think it’s a good time to get into it is because they just released their first purchase order, they have a plan to start mass producing by end of 2024, to grow revenue exponentially, to become profitable in less than 3 years, and the general public is not aware of this stock yet.

The stock is currently $18 but has gone as high as $30+ in the past, and has been uptrending since the beginning of this year.

There is chatter in the ENVX community that this stock has the potential to be a NVDA or ENPH type of stock because they have unlimited customers/huge TAM.

Here are some reasons I'm bullish on ENVX (DYOR NFA):

* Compelling use case and understandable product: ENVX offers an innovative, high-performance battery solution designed to power future devices more efficiently, safer, and for longer durations. As someone who prefers to invest in things I understand, this makes sense to me.

* Experienced and accomplished team: ENVX benefits from a team of Silicon Valley veterans who possess deep expertise and a successful track record in the industry. This includes TJ Rodgers from $ENPH as the director of the board. 

* Partnerships: ENVX has received PO, interest and secured partnerships with well-known companies, enhancing its credibility and market reach.

* Establishing a moat: ENVX is strategically building a strong competitive advantage through a combination of patents and specialized, custom, and costly equipment necessary for battery production, making it difficult for competitors to replicate their offerings.

* Consistent flow of company news and updates: ENVX consistently communicates important milestones, achievements, and progress, ensuring transparency and fostering investor confidence.

* Active and engaged community: The ENVX community has a strong presence on Twitter and other social media platforms. Might even have the potential to be a Reddit favorite, just like $ENPH is.

* Potential for profitability and mass production within the next 1-2 years: After a decade of R&amp;D, ENVX is now on track to achieve profitability and ramp up mass production in the near future, potentially leading to revenue growth. The old exec team was just replaced this year with a new team with more/better experience. 

 * Potential for widespread adoption: ENVX's superior battery technology positions them well for mass adoption, given the increasing demand for long-lasting and efficient power solutions in various industries.

How many products can benefit from a better battery?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is led by a team of semiconductor industry veterans with tons of experience in scaling manufacturing and growing companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Board is led by TJ Rodgers from $ENPH fame and the board is convinced that creating a better battery is one the next large challenges that tech needs to solve, is prime for disruption, and they are dedicated to take on the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enovix has been doing R&amp;amp;D for 10+ years and they are finally ready to start mass producing their batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have lots of large customers in the pipeline and they just announced a purchase order from a supplier for the US Army which is why the price increased this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are waiting for more press releases such as manufacturing updates, additional POs, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is pre-profit and the reason I think it’s a good time to get into it is because they just released their first purchase order, they have a plan to start mass producing by end of 2024, to grow revenue exponentially, to become profitable in less than 3 years, and the general public is not aware of this stock yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stock is currently $18 but has gone as high as $30+ in the past, and has been uptrending since the beginning of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is chatter in the ENVX community that this stock has the potential to be a NVDA or ENPH type of stock because they have unlimited customers/huge TAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some reasons I&amp;#39;m bullish on ENVX (DYOR NFA):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compelling use case and understandable product: ENVX offers an innovative, high-performance battery solution designed to power future devices more efficiently, safer, and for longer durations. As someone who prefers to invest in things I understand, this makes sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experienced and accomplished team: ENVX benefits from a team of Silicon Valley veterans who possess deep expertise and a successful track record in the industry. This includes TJ Rodgers from $ENPH as the director of the board. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partnerships: ENVX has received PO, interest and secured partnerships with well-known companies, enhancing its credibility and market reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Establishing a moat: ENVX is strategically building a strong competitive advantage through a combination of patents and specialized, custom, and costly equipment necessary for battery production, making it difficult for competitors to replicate their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistent flow of company news and updates: ENVX consistently communicates important milestones, achievements, and progress, ensuring transparency and fostering investor confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active and engaged community: The ENVX community has a strong presence on Twitter and other social media platforms. Might even have the potential to be a Reddit favorite, just like $ENPH is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential for profitability and mass production within the next 1-2 years: After a decade of R&amp;amp;D, ENVX is now on track to achieve profitability and ramp up mass production in the near future, potentially leading to revenue growth. The old exec team was just replaced this year with a new team with more/better experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential for widespread adoption: ENVX&amp;#39;s superior battery technology positions them well for mass adoption, given the increasing demand for long-lasting and efficient power solutions in various industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

845,stocks,"5 types of stocks that make good investments:  
  
(1) Fast Growers: Young companies with high growth potential. They are often risky, but they can also be very rewarding. They are usually small, innovative, and take on established players. They grow rapidly, but with this growth comes risk. Tesla is an excellent example, having grown immensely over the past decade despite significant risks. Owning a successful Fast Grower can turbocharge your portfolio returns.  
  
(2) Turnarounds: Companies that have fallen on hard times but are now turning things around. They are less risky than fast growers, but they also offer lower potential returns. A recent example is Chipotle. These stocks can provide big gains, but they also entail significant risks. They are high-risk, high-reward investments.  
  
(3) Stalwarts: Large, established companies with consistent performance even in mature industries. Coca-Cola is an excellent example. Owning these stocks can provide a steady stream of returns with less volatility. They are less risky than fast growers, but they also offer lower potential returns.  
  
(4) Cyclicals: These companies' profits ebb and flow with economic cycles. As their profits are closely tied to economic conditions, timing is everything when investing in these stocks. When the economy is thriving, the demand for their products escalates due to strong construction and manufacturing activity. Conversely, in a sluggish economy, the sales and profits of these products tend to decline.

**Why it matters**: The rally — which some argue is the early stage of a new bull market — reflects relief that inflation has eased without a recession, as well as a dash of AI hype for a bit of speculative spice.

**By the numbers:**

* The S&amp;P 500 is up 14.5%.
* The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index is up by 29.9%.
* The small-cap Russell 2000 — driven by expectations for the U.S. economy over the relatively short term — is up by 6.8%.

**Context:** After an awful 2022 — the S&amp;P's 19.4% fall was its worst since 2008 — investors were pretty darn bearish coming into this year. And for good reason...

* Inflation was still over 6%.
* More Fed rate hikes were expected.
* As a result, almost everybody was predicting a recession — and atrocious corporate profits.
* Oh, and there was the not-insignificant risk that the U.S. would default on its debts, setting off a financial crisis.

**Yes, but:** Things worked out OK. Inflation is now 4%, and the Fed took a breather on rate hikes. A debt ceiling deal got done, and the U.S. economy is a lot stronger than many expected. Corporate profits were fine.

* Even the worst banking panic since the financial crisis, which broke out in March with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, didn't weigh on the market for long.

**Be smart:** There's an old aphorism on Wall Street that stocks like to climb a ""wall of worry.""

* Translation: Stocks tend to rise when investors start out as pessimists but grow gradually more confident when ugly scenarios they worried about don't come to pass.
* This is basically what's been happening in 2023

848,stocks,"Earnings are a measure of how much money a company makes. As a result, earnings growth will continue to captivate nearly everyone in the investment world. However, earnings acceleration is more effective in raising stock prices.

According to studies, the most successful stocks have seen an increase in earnings prior to an increase in stock price. Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG), Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (CCL), and Marathon Digital are three notable companies that have seen solid earnings growth recently (MARA).

Earnings acceleration, in fact, is the incremental growth in earnings per share of a company (EPS). In other words, earnings acceleration occurs when the rate of a company's quarter-over-quarter earnings growth accelerates within a specified time frame.

Earnings growth requires you to pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. However, earnings acceleration can help identify stocks that haven't yet captured the attention of investors. Once secured, the share price will almost certainly rise. This is due to the fact that earnings acceleration takes into account both the direction and magnitude of growth rate.

An increasing percentage of earnings growth indicates that the company's fundamentals are sound and that it has been on the right track for some time. Meanwhile, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, whereas a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may occasionally drag down prices.

**Screening Parameters**

Consider stocks whose last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates have exceeded the previous periods' growth rates. The projected quarterly percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the growth rates in previous periods. Price currently greater than or equal to $5: This eliminates low-priced stocks.

A 20-day average volume greater than or equal to 50,000 indicates that the stocks have adequate liquidity.

The above criteria reduced the universe of approximately 7,735 stocks to only three. The stocks are as follows:

**Constellation Energy** generates and sells electricity in the United States. Zacks Rank #2 CEG’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 938.8%. 

**Carnival Corporation** engages in the provision of leisure travel services. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3. CCL’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 95.3%.

**Marathon Digital** is a digital asset technology company that mines cryptocurrencies, with a focus on the blockchain ecosystem and the generation of digital assets.

Tattooed Chef, Inc. (Nasdaq: TTCF) (“Tattooed Chef” or the “Company”), a leader in plant-based foods, announced today that it intends to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (“Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California (“Bankruptcy Court”) and intends to pursue a sale of substantially all of its assets under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. In accordance with the sale process under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Company will market its assets and solicit competing bids from interested parties. The bidding process is designed to achieve the highest and best price for the Company’s assets. The Company will manage the bidding process and evaluate any bids received, in consultation with its advisors and as overseen by the Bankruptcy Court. The Company seeks to complete an expedited sale process, with any sales subject to review by creditors and approval by the Bankruptcy Court.  

The Company expects to continue operations during the Chapter 11 process, including, but not limited to, paying employees and continuing existing benefits programs, meeting commitments to customers and fulfilling go-forward obligations, including key vendor payments.   To help fund its operations during this process, the Company is finalizing the terms of debtor in possession financing to be provided by its existing secured lender.

“I remain ever grateful to our colleagues at Tattooed Chef who helped to shape this remarkable journey and help to introduce plant-based foods and healthy eating to consumers across the country,” said Sam Galletti, Chairman and CEO. “Despite their commitment to our mission and our best efforts to maintain the operations of Tattooed Chef, our business has continued to be impacted by a challenging financing environment and an inability to raise additional capital.

The talks come amid a broader retreat by Goldman from its largely failed consumer banking initiatives, for which CEO David Solomon has taken a great deal of heat.

It would mark an abrupt reversal for the two corporate giants. In October, the Journal reported Goldman and Apple renewed their partnership through 2029. And in April, Goldman Chief Financial Officer Denis Coleman touted a deepening of the partnership. “This week, we announced the launch of a savings account for Apple Card users.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 3rd, 2023.

# **S&amp;P 500 rises on Friday to close out big first half, Nasdaq posts best start to a year in 4 decades: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rose slightly Friday, touching the 4,300 level for the first time since August 2022 as investors looked ahead to upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve’s latest policy announcement.
*****
&gt; Stocks rose Friday and technology names continued their staggering run to cap off a strong start to the year, and the best first half for the Nasdaq Composite since 1983.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 285.18 points, or 0.84%, to close at 34,407.60. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.23% to end at 4,450.38, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.45% to settle at 13,787.92.
*****
&gt; Mega-cap technology stocks responsible for a sizeable chunk of 2023′s market gains rose Friday. Dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia jumped 3.6%, bringing its yearly gains to more than 189%. Netflix added about 2.9%, while Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Amazon rose 1.9%, 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively. Apple gained 2.3% to close above a $3 trillion market cap.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Nike shares bucked the broad market uptrend. The apparel giant fell 2.7% after reporting a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit.
*****
&gt; Friday marked a pivotal day for investors, bringing the conclusion of the month, second quarter and first half. The last six months saw 2022′s beaten-down growth names make a broad comeback as the promise of artificial intelligence and hope of an end to the Federal Reserve’s rate campaign lifted major tech players to astonishing heights.
*****
&gt; Despite these strong gains, some on Wall Street expect volatility in the second half and likely profit taking from investors that benefited from the rally. This, coupled with changing technicals, could lead to sideways action, or a slight pullback in the S&amp;P, said Anna Han, equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities.
*****
&gt; “The technicals are telling us that this ubercap-led rally has just been overextended,” she said. “It’s been hitting those overbought levels, and we believe it’s time for that trade to kind of take a pause.”
*****
&gt; This is where the major averages stand:
*****
&gt; * For June: The S&amp;P 500 gained 6.5% for its best monthly performance since October. The Nasdaq advanced 6.6%. Both indexes notched a fourth consecutive positive month. The Dow climbed 4.6%, for its best month since November.
&gt; * For the second quarter: The S&amp;P 500 rose 8.3%, on track for a third straight quarter of gains and its biggest quarterly advance since the fourth quarter of 2021. The Nasdaq jumped 12.8% for back-to-back positive quarters. The Dow added 3.4% for a third winning quarter.
&gt; * For year to date and the first half: The S&amp;P 500 has popped 15.9% for its best first half since 2019. The Nasdaq surged 31.7%, for its best first half since 1983. The 30-stock Dow added a modest gain of 3.8%.
The three major averages also notched winning weeks, gaining more than 2% each.

*****
&gt; Wall Street also got another hint of encouraging inflation news as the core personal consumption expenditures price index, a closely watched gauge by the Federal Reserve, rose less than expected in May.
*****
&gt; “This is excellent news on the inflation fight,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group. “If you don’t believe disinflation is happening, you aren’t paying attention. The Fed was right to pause and needs to hold firm at these levels to prevent overcorrecting and causing an unnecessary recession to fight a beast that is now under control.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ffbcd50de3d1daa859f383b45f9e2428/1327512fd24c5fb2-b2/s500x750/2e57e0999be12e26959385cf4b4c8089a06328c3.jpg))**

&gt; Over the past 21 years from 2002-2022 July’s first trading has the second-best record up 85.7% of the time on the S&amp;P 500 with an average gain of 0.35%. Only August’s third to last trading day has a better record up 19 of 21 with an average gain of 0.57%.

&gt; DJIA’s first trading day of July has produced gains 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.31%. NASDAQ splits the middle up 81.0% (0.31% average gain) of the time. July’s first trading day is the third best performing first trading day of all twelve months based upon DJIA points gained with DJIA gaining a cumulative 1668.15 points since 1998.

&gt; Looking back even further to 1989, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 88.2% of the time (up 30 times in 34 years) with an average gain of 0.50%. DJIA has advanced 28 times in the same 34 years (82.4%) and NASDAQ has risen in 26 of those years (76.5%) with an average advance of 0.34% in all years. No other day of the year exhibits this amount of across-the-board strength, which makes a solid case for declaring the first trading day of July the most bullish day of the year over the past 34 years.

&gt; # This is a Big Deal: Business Investment is Rising Again

&gt; We’ve been getting a string of “economic surprises” from the consumer side for several months now. Employment data is a prime example, with monthly payroll gains coming in above expectations for 14 straight months. For a change, we just got some good news from the business side, particularly business investment.

&gt; The Census Bureau collects data on manufacturers’ shipments and new orders for durable goods – big ticket items like transportation equipment (including vehicles and aircrafts), machinery, computers and electronic products, electrical equipment, and appliances, etc. New orders are particularly useful because it tells us how businesses are viewing current and future economic conditions and investing accordingly. It also tells us about future production commitments for manufacturers.

&gt; Well, new orders rose 1.7% in May, even as economists expected orders to decline almost 1%! New orders are now up 5.4% since last year, and this pace is higher than what we saw at any point in 2019.

&gt; A large part of this is because of nondefense aircraft orders, which surged 32% in May, and a whopping 61% over the past year. This is huge for America’s aircraft industry – the recent uptrend stands in sharp contrast to what we saw in 2018-2019 when aircraft orders were declining amid Boeing’s 737-Max woes.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-29-new-orders-aircrafts-800x633.png))**

&gt; However, as you can see above, aircraft orders are really volatile. It helps to strip them out, along with new orders from the defense industry (which can also be quite volatile).

&gt; What’s left is a key economic datapoint – a category called nondefense capital goods ex aircraft, which is really a proxy for business investment, or capital expenditures (“capex”). This rose 0.7% in May, yet another datapoint that beat forecasts (expectations were for a 0.1% increase). New orders for these “core capital goods” are now up 2.1% from last year and rising at a 3.2% annualized pace over the first 5 months of this year.

&gt; Now, this data is nominal, in that it’s not adjusted for prices. And we’ve had a lot of inflation over the past year and a half. But even after you adjust for inflation, this proxy for business investment rose 0.3% in May, following a 0.5% increase in April. Investment in real terms has been falling since the beginning of 2022, and so the 0.8% uptick over the past two months is very welcome.

&gt; Here’s something a lot of people don’t talk about when they compare today’s economy to the pre-pandemic economy, which is widely recognized as strong: business investment collapsed in 2019, amid a lot of uncertainty around the trade war, and escalating tariffs. Hopefully, the recent uptick not only reverses the downtrend from last year, but also the pre-pandemic downtrend.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-29-new-orders-core-capital-goods-598x800.png))**

&gt; We do recognize that two months do not make a trend. But other data also corroborate the fact that businesses are investing again.

&gt; **Something big is happening in America**

&gt; Nonresidential construction is booming, mostly thanks to manufacturing construction. I discussed what was happening a few months ago, but there has been no slowdown in the data since then. Even after adjusting for inflation, manufacturing construction is up 84% over the past year through April. Most of this is being driven by a 233% increase in construction in the computers, electronics, and electricals sector, i.e. semiconductor and electrical vehicle battery plants.

&gt; The chart below shows how manufacturing construction was stagnant across most of the past decade, but it seems to have broken out now. There was an inflection point last summer after Congress passed the CHIPS Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (which had less to do with inflation and more to do with promoting investment via subsidies and tax credits). Also interesting, this is a phenomenon that is happening only in the US – other developed countries like Germany, Japan, UK, and Australia are not seeing a similar surge.

&gt; Finally, if you look at just S&amp;P 500 companies, capital expenditure expectations over the next 12 months have been rising consistently this year. Forward-looking capex expectations are up almost 4% over the first six months of this year, and up 7% compared to a year ago.

&gt; This is not something that would be happening amid a slowdown, let alone a recession. The chart below shows how capex expectations were stagnant in 2019 amid higher uncertainty. That’s not the case today, even amid all the recession forecasts.

&gt; Business sentiment has been quite poor, perhaps because of all the headline-grabbing recession forecasts. However, the hard data suggests that businesses are investing and looking to expand capacity – a sign that they view future economic conditions positively when it comes to putting money to work.

&gt; # There's Something About June 29th

&gt; There must be something about June 29th. Besides being a significant day of the year from a seasonal perspective (as discussed in Wednesday's Chart of the Day), two crucial events related to some of the most significant business stories of the past two decades took place on this day, two years apart. The first involved Bernie Madoff, who infamously orchestrated the largest Ponzi scheme in history, although it is worth noting that Madoff once described the Federal Government as another Ponzi scheme, so by his logic, he would have only overseen the second largest Ponzi scheme ever. On this day in 2009, Madoff, once a highly respected and well-loved figure on Wall Street, stood alone in a Manhattan courtroom, devoid of any familial or friendly support, and received a sentence of 150 years in prison.

&gt; On a much brighter note, two years earlier in 2007, Apple fans lined up and, in some cases, camped outside of stores for days to be among the first to get their hands on the first-generation iPhone. The fact that people were willing to pay over $500 for a heretofore unproven smartphone should have been all we needed to see to know that this was going to usher in a revolution in the entire computing industry.

&gt; Given the success of the iPhone and the scandal of Madoff, you would think that the launch of the iPhone would have been a positive market event and the Madoff sentencing would be associated with a negative market environment. As the chart below illustrates, though, the exact opposite was the case. The first iPhones didn’t just go on sale within four months of any ordinary market peak; the formal launch preceded a 56%+ peak-to-trough drop in the S&amp;P 500 that was the largest drawdowns since the Great Depression. Conversely, Madoff’s sentencing came less than four months after that same largest drawdown since the Great Depression ended.

&gt; We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again, but investing based on the headlines can be one of the worst investment strategies known to man.

&gt; # July Historically Opens Strong, But Fades After Mid-Month

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/dc2d0ec1b1feca14027b1079c4265f04/4da4ae35f1413c04-f3/s500x750/dacadbe1082ae3c1c3d7ca9a1ae13701b64aca8a.jpg))**

&gt; July is the third month of DJIA’s and S&amp;P 500’s “Worst Six Months” and the first month of NASDAQ’s “Worst Four Months.” Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. But by around mid-month, inflows have faded and the market’s performance in July usually peaks. This tends to create a strong open and first half. In all the years examined the major indexes tend to reach a peak around mid-month and then drift sideways to slightly lower for the remainder of the month. In pre-election years since 1950, the mid-month peak and second half declines have more pronounced especially for NASDAQ and Russell 2000.

&gt; # Tech Selloff Sets Up NASDAQ’s Midyear Rally

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/404c7ff927b906208e884b76137c85c7/827015a9b340641c-68/s500x750/cbba45e864f792bd2ccb1bedd46b17ebc561f760.jpg))**

&gt; The week after June Triple Witching delivered its expected weakness, but this sets up NASDAQ’s 12-day midyear rally to a T.

&gt; In the mid-1980s tech’s influence in the market began to grow and the market’s focus in early summer shifted to the outlook for second quarter earnings of technology companies. In anticipation of positive results, over the last three trading days of June and the first nine trading days in July, NASDAQ typically enjoys a rally. This 12-day run has been up 29 of the past 38 years with an average historical gain of 2.4%. Look for this rally to begin around June 28 and run until about July 14.

&gt; After the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000, NASDAQ’s mid-year rally had a spotty track record from 2002 until 2009 with three appearances and five no-shows in those years. However, it has been quite solid over the last thirteen years, up eleven times with two losses. Last year, NASDAQ faltered during the 12-day span, but eventually took off in the second half of July, up 12.3%.

&gt; Our strategy is to buy the close on Tuesday June 27 and sell July 14 or take profits on any sizable gain in between.

&gt; # DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ historically cooler in pre-election year Julys

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ca5fdb98c2d927ebcb80de754a93067/279ecd4a9c258a7f-76/s500x750/b0e1de7b68ed5c448a0ebd8602cd9073334c2e2a.jpg))**

&gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter, however the mostly negative results in August and September tend to make the comparison easy. “Hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% combined with strong performances in 2013, 2018, and 2022 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.3% and 1.3% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2023).

&gt; Pre-election-year July rankings are something of a mixed bag, ranking #7 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500, averaging gains of 1.0% and 0.9% respectively (since 1950); while NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979) pre-election Julys both rank #9. NASDAQ has advanced in seven of the last thirteen pre-election Julys. Russell 2000 has advanced in five of its last ten. Despite tech’s and small-cap’s meager pre-election July track record, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have averaged gains of 1.0% and 0.3% respectively.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and an awesome holiday shortened trading week ahead r/stocks. :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Friday evening to all of you here on &lt;a href=""/r/stocks""&gt;r/stocks&lt;/a&gt;! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week, month, quarter and H2 ahead. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 3rd, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 rises on Friday to close out big first half, Nasdaq posts best start to a year in 4 decades: Live updates - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 rose slightly Friday, touching the 4,300 level for the first time since August 2022 as investors looked ahead to upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve’s latest policy announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks rose Friday and technology names continued their staggering run to cap off a strong start to the year, and the best first half for the Nasdaq Composite since 1983.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 285.18 points, or 0.84%, to close at 34,407.60. The S&amp;amp;P 500 climbed 1.23% to end at 4,450.38, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.45% to settle at 13,787.92.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mega-cap technology stocks responsible for a sizeable chunk of 2023′s market gains rose Friday. Dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia jumped 3.6%, bringing its yearly gains to more than 189%. Netflix added about 2.9%, while Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Amazon rose 1.9%, 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively. Apple gained 2.3% to close above a $3 trillion market cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Nike shares bucked the broad market uptrend. The apparel giant fell 2.7% after reporting a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday marked a pivotal day for investors, bringing the conclusion of the month, second quarter and first half. The last six months saw 2022′s beaten-down growth names make a broad comeback as the promise of artificial intelligence and hope of an end to the Federal Reserve’s rate campaign lifted major tech players to astonishing heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these strong gains, some on Wall Street expect volatility in the second half and likely profit taking from investors that benefited from the rally. This, coupled with changing technicals, could lead to sideways action, or a slight pullback in the S&amp;amp;P, said Anna Han, equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The technicals are telling us that this ubercap-led rally has just been overextended,” she said. “It’s been hitting those overbought levels, and we believe it’s time for that trade to kind of take a pause.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the major averages stand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For June: The S&amp;amp;P 500 gained 6.5% for its best monthly performance since October. The Nasdaq advanced 6.6%. Both indexes notched a fourth consecutive positive month. The Dow climbed 4.6%, for its best month since November.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the second quarter: The S&amp;amp;P 500 rose 8.3%, on track for a third straight quarter of gains and its biggest quarterly advance since the fourth quarter of 2021. The Nasdaq jumped 12.8% for back-to-back positive quarters. The Dow added 3.4% for a third winning quarter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For year to date and the first half: The S&amp;amp;P 500 has popped 15.9% for its best first half since 2019. The Nasdaq surged 31.7%, for its best first half since 1983. The 30-stock Dow added a modest gain of 3.8%.
The three major averages also notched winning weeks, gaining more than 2% each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street also got another hint of encouraging inflation news as the core personal consumption expenditures price index, a closely watched gauge by the Federal Reserve, rose less than expected in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is excellent news on the inflation fight,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group. “If you don’t believe disinflation is happening, you aren’t paying attention. The Fed was right to pause and needs to hold firm at these levels to prevent overcorrecting and causing an unnecessary recession to fight a beast that is now under control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;amp;P:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 21 years from 2002-2022 July’s first trading has the second-best record up 85.7% of the time on the S&amp;amp;P 500 with an average gain of 0.35%. Only August’s third to last trading day has a better record up 19 of 21 with an average gain of 0.57%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DJIA’s first trading day of July has produced gains 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.31%. NASDAQ splits the middle up 81.0% (0.31% average gain) of the time. July’s first trading day is the third best performing first trading day of all twelve months based upon DJIA points gained with DJIA gaining a cumulative 1668.15 points since 1998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back even further to 1989, S&amp;amp;P 500 has advanced 88.2% of the time (up 30 times in 34 years) with an average gain of 0.50%. DJIA has advanced 28 times in the same 34 years (82.4%) and NASDAQ has risen in 26 of those years (76.5%) with an average advance of 0.34% in all years. No other day of the year exhibits this amount of across-the-board strength, which makes a solid case for declaring the first trading day of July the most bullish day of the year over the past 34 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is a Big Deal: Business Investment is Rising Again&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been getting a string of “economic surprises” from the consumer side for several months now. Employment data is a prime example, with monthly payroll gains coming in above expectations for 14 straight months. For a change, we just got some good news from the business side, particularly business investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Census Bureau collects data on manufacturers’ shipments and new orders for durable goods – big ticket items like transportation equipment (including vehicles and aircrafts), machinery, computers and electronic products, electrical equipment, and appliances, etc. New orders are particularly useful because it tells us how businesses are viewing current and future economic conditions and investing accordingly. It also tells us about future production commitments for manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, new orders rose 1.7% in May, even as economists expected orders to decline almost 1%! New orders are now up 5.4% since last year, and this pace is higher than what we saw at any point in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large part of this is because of nondefense aircraft orders, which surged 32% in May, and a whopping 61% over the past year. This is huge for America’s aircraft industry – the recent uptrend stands in sharp contrast to what we saw in 2018-2019 when aircraft orders were declining amid Boeing’s 737-Max woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-29-new-orders-aircrafts-800x633.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as you can see above, aircraft orders are really volatile. It helps to strip them out, along with new orders from the defense industry (which can also be quite volatile).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s left is a key economic datapoint – a category called nondefense capital goods ex aircraft, which is really a proxy for business investment, or capital expenditures (“capex”). This rose 0.7% in May, yet another datapoint that beat forecasts (expectations were for a 0.1% increase). New orders for these “core capital goods” are now up 2.1% from last year and rising at a 3.2% annualized pace over the first 5 months of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this data is nominal, in that it’s not adjusted for prices. And we’ve had a lot of inflation over the past year and a half. But even after you adjust for inflation, this proxy for business investment rose 0.3% in May, following a 0.5% increase in April. Investment in real terms has been falling since the beginning of 2022, and so the 0.8% uptick over the past two months is very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s something a lot of people don’t talk about when they compare today’s economy to the pre-pandemic economy, which is widely recognized as strong: business investment collapsed in 2019, amid a lot of uncertainty around the trade war, and escalating tariffs. Hopefully, the recent uptick not only reverses the downtrend from last year, but also the pre-pandemic downtrend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-29-new-orders-core-capital-goods-598x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do recognize that two months do not make a trend. But other data also corroborate the fact that businesses are investing again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something big is happening in America&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonresidential construction is booming, mostly thanks to manufacturing construction. I discussed what was happening a few months ago, but there has been no slowdown in the data since then. Even after adjusting for inflation, manufacturing construction is up 84% over the past year through April. Most of this is being driven by a 233% increase in construction in the computers, electronics, and electricals sector, i.e. semiconductor and electrical vehicle battery plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows how manufacturing construction was stagnant across most of the past decade, but it seems to have broken out now. There was an inflection point last summer after Congress passed the CHIPS Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (which had less to do with inflation and more to do with promoting investment via subsidies and tax credits). Also interesting, this is a phenomenon that is happening only in the US – other developed countries like Germany, Japan, UK, and Australia are not seeing a similar surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-29-manufacturing-construction-601x800.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you look at just S&amp;amp;P 500 companies, capital expenditure expectations over the next 12 months have been rising consistently this year. Forward-looking capex expectations are up almost 4% over the first six months of this year, and up 7% compared to a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not something that would be happening amid a slowdown, let alone a recession. The chart below shows how capex expectations were stagnant in 2019 amid higher uncertainty. That’s not the case today, even amid all the recession forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-29-SP500-forward-capex-800x619.png""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business sentiment has been quite poor, perhaps because of all the headline-grabbing recession forecasts. However, the hard data suggests that businesses are investing and looking to expand capacity – a sign that they view future economic conditions positively when it comes to putting money to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;There&amp;#39;s Something About June 29th&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There must be something about June 29th. Besides being a significant day of the year from a seasonal perspective (as discussed in Wednesday&amp;#39;s Chart of the Day), two crucial events related to some of the most significant business stories of the past two decades took place on this day, two years apart. The first involved Bernie Madoff, who infamously orchestrated the largest Ponzi scheme in history, although it is worth noting that Madoff once described the Federal Government as another Ponzi scheme, so by his logic, he would have only overseen the second largest Ponzi scheme ever. On this day in 2009, Madoff, once a highly respected and well-loved figure on Wall Street, stood alone in a Manhattan courtroom, devoid of any familial or friendly support, and received a sentence of 150 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a much brighter note, two years earlier in 2007, Apple fans lined up and, in some cases, camped outside of stores for days to be among the first to get their hands on the first-generation iPhone. The fact that people were willing to pay over $500 for a heretofore unproven smartphone should have been all we needed to see to know that this was going to usher in a revolution in the entire computing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the success of the iPhone and the scandal of Madoff, you would think that the launch of the iPhone would have been a positive market event and the Madoff sentencing would be associated with a negative market environment. As the chart below illustrates, though, the exact opposite was the case. The first iPhones didn’t just go on sale within four months of any ordinary market peak; the formal launch preceded a 56%+ peak-to-trough drop in the S&amp;amp;P 500 that was the largest drawdowns since the Great Depression. Conversely, Madoff’s sentencing came less than four months after that same largest drawdown since the Great Depression ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again, but investing based on the headlines can be one of the worst investment strategies known to man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;July Historically Opens Strong, But Fades After Mid-Month&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/dc2d0ec1b1feca14027b1079c4265f04/4da4ae35f1413c04-f3/s500x750/dacadbe1082ae3c1c3d7ca9a1ae13701b64aca8a.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July is the third month of DJIA’s and S&amp;amp;P 500’s “Worst Six Months” and the first month of NASDAQ’s “Worst Four Months.” Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. But by around mid-month, inflows have faded and the market’s performance in July usually peaks. This tends to create a strong open and first half. In all the years examined the major indexes tend to reach a peak around mid-month and then drift sideways to slightly lower for the remainder of the month. In pre-election years since 1950, the mid-month peak and second half declines have more pronounced especially for NASDAQ and Russell 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tech Selloff Sets Up NASDAQ’s Midyear Rally&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/404c7ff927b906208e884b76137c85c7/827015a9b340641c-68/s500x750/cbba45e864f792bd2ccb1bedd46b17ebc561f760.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week after June Triple Witching delivered its expected weakness, but this sets up NASDAQ’s 12-day midyear rally to a T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1980s tech’s influence in the market began to grow and the market’s focus in early summer shifted to the outlook for second quarter earnings of technology companies. In anticipation of positive results, over the last three trading days of June and the first nine trading days in July, NASDAQ typically enjoys a rally. This 12-day run has been up 29 of the past 38 years with an average historical gain of 2.4%. Look for this rally to begin around June 28 and run until about July 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000, NASDAQ’s mid-year rally had a spotty track record from 2002 until 2009 with three appearances and five no-shows in those years. However, it has been quite solid over the last thirteen years, up eleven times with two losses. Last year, NASDAQ faltered during the 12-day span, but eventually took off in the second half of July, up 12.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our strategy is to buy the close on Tuesday June 27 and sell July 14 or take profits on any sizable gain in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;DJIA, S&amp;amp;P 500 and NASDAQ historically cooler in pre-election year Julys&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ca5fdb98c2d927ebcb80de754a93067/279ecd4a9c258a7f-76/s500x750/b0e1de7b68ed5c448a0ebd8602cd9073334c2e2a.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter, however the mostly negative results in August and September tend to make the comparison easy. “Hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% combined with strong performances in 2013, 2018, and 2022 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.3% and 1.3% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2023).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/85102b97863f6c9f07b63c7af59848ad/279ecd4a9c258a7f-ea/s500x750/559380e2c01eacc909f8c0d54ffbb5882a7cbbff.jpg""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-election-year July rankings are something of a mixed bag, ranking #7 for DJIA and S&amp;amp;P 500, averaging gains of 1.0% and 0.9% respectively (since 1950); while NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979) pre-election Julys both rank #9. NASDAQ has advanced in seven of the last thirteen pre-election Julys. Russell 2000 has advanced in five of its last ten. Despite tech’s and small-cap’s meager pre-election July track record, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have averaged gains of 1.0% and 0.3% respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

860,stocks,"&gt; Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund valued its holdings in Reddit at $15.4 million as of May 31, according to the fund’s monthly disclosure released Friday. That’s down 7.36% from the $16.6 million mark at April’s closure and altogether a slide of 45.4% since its investment in August 2021. The updated share value suggests a $5.5 billion valuation for Reddit.

It was $10B in Aug 2021.

[Originally Reddit wanted to go IPO for $15B](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/01/fidelity-reddit-valuation/), which it was valued around that in late 2021.  Obviously a lot has happened since then, so it's doubtful they'll get over $5B.

Seeing how Reddit's revenue is [over half a billion](https://sacra.com/c/reddit/) and typically IPOs like that will IPO around $2B; growth is another factor which has slumped down to 36%, so perhaps we won't ever see a Reddit IPO until they get their revenue higher &amp; revenue growth back up.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund valued its holdings in Reddit at $15.4 million as of May 31, according to the fund’s monthly disclosure released Friday. That’s down 7.36% from the $16.6 million mark at April’s closure and altogether a slide of 45.4% since its investment in August 2021. The updated share value suggests a $5.5 billion valuation for Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was $10B in Aug 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

(1) Digital disruption and artificial intelligence. AI-driven productivity gains could boost profit margins for companies that are able to adopt these technologies. Companies that spend the most on staffing and have large sets of proprietary data will be best positioned to benefit from AI.  
  
(2) An evolving financial sector. The financial sector is evolving as non-bank lenders step in to compete with traditional banks. This could lead to new opportunities for investment in financial technology.

This could lead to higher inflation in the long run, as well as a demand shift towards senior-targeted industries such as healthcare, real estate, and leisure.

#[Stock futures rise as S&amp;P 500 closes out huge first half gain: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose as traders looked ahead to Friday’s May jobs report and cheered lawmakers passing a debt ceiling bill that averts a U.S. default.
*****
&gt; U.S. equity futures rose Friday as Wall Street looked to cap off a banner start to 2023 and the best first half for the Nasdaq Composite since 1983.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures ticked higher by 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%.
*****
&gt; Apple shares rose nearly 1% before the bell to trade above a $3 trillion market cap. Elsewhere, Nike shares fell about 3% after the apparel giant reported a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit.
*****
&gt; Friday is a pivotal day for investors, marking not just the end of the June, but also the conclusion of the second quarter and the first half. Here is where the indexes stand as of Thursday’s close:
*****
&gt; * For June: The S&amp;P 500 has gained 5.18% and is on pace for its best monthly performance since January. The Nasdaq has advanced 5.07%, and both it and the broad-market index are heading for a fourth consecutive positive month. The Dow has climbed 3.69%, and it’s on track for its best month since November.
*****
&gt; * For the second quarter: The S&amp;P 500 has risen 6.99% and is tracking for a third straight quarter of gains. The Nasdaq touts a gain of 11.2% for back-to-back positive quarters. The Dow has jumped 2.55%, but it’s also on pace for a third winning quarter.
*****
&gt; * For year to date and the first half: The S&amp;P 500 has popped 14.51%, and it’s heading for its best first half since 2018. The Nasdaq has surged nearly 30%, tracking for its best first half since 1983. The 30-stock Dow has a more modest gain of 2.94%.
*****
&gt; The three major averages are also on pace for winning weeks, with the S&amp;P 500 and Dow up more than 1% each, and the Nasdaq tracking for a 0.7% increase.
*****
&gt; Investor attention is on May core PCE data, the Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge, due out at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday. The core personal consumption expenditures price index is expected to show a 0.3% increase, according to economists polled by Dow Jones. On an annual basis, the gauge is expected to have increased 4.7% — the same rate at which it grew in the prior month.
*****
&gt; Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg, said there’s a push and pull between a soft- landing scenario that’s driven by strong economic data and the Fed, which is positioning for a tougher tone going forward.
*****
&gt; “Even though the economic data has been strong … the Fed has continued to surprise on the upside in terms of how far they could go with their tightening,” she said. “They’ve made it clear that inflation remains their top priority, and they can do that because the job market has remained so strong, but you know, their ultimate goal is to tighten enough that you see some economic weakness so there’s less inflationary pressure.”

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

879,stocks,"I think I’ve found something a little hidden, but wanted to test my hypothesis with some of the more experienced investors on here. We all know the value of data - and now big data. Google has a market cap of $1.51 trillion. Bloomberg pulled in $12.2 billion in revenue in 2022. Palantir which builds software to integrate data has a market cap of $29 billion and a more palatable 15x p/s multiplier than when they IPO’d Or how about Alterxy which has an impossibly convoluted vision (hopefully unlike this post): “The company's analytics platform enables organizations to enhance business outcomes and the productivity of their business analysts, data scientists, citizen data scientists, and data engineers.”  
  
But what if sports data is the next liquid gold? Three things need to happen for this to be the case:  
  
Gen Z continue their heightened consumption of data and gamified products   
Sports data becomes harder to obtain with leagues spotting the value in their own data  
AI provides richer experiences for fans and teams and becomes more important to the sport its  
  
So what is sports data?  
  
Sports data refers to the collection and analysis of information related to various sporting events, athletes, teams, and related statistics. It encompasses a wide range of data points, including player performance, team statistics, historical records, injuries, weather conditions, betting odds, and much more. Sports data is gathered from a variety of sources, such as live game feeds, official scorekeepers, sports leagues, broadcasters, and specialized data providers.  
And who owns this data?  
Well, it depends. Sometimes it is the leagues which own their whole value chain and do not outsource their data. The teams or even the athletes can claim ownership to certain data. Sometimes the TV networks purchase and own the data. Finally, sports data companies buy or are licensed to create the leagues’ data. This is where the real money is.   
Who are the key players in this industry?  
In my research, I came across four key companies:  
Sportradar or $SRAD - who dominate market share. To give some comparison, 2022 revenues were $781m, compared to their closest rival Genius Sports or $GENI with $341m. $SRAD own the NBA, NHL and MLB rights.   
$GENI - scheduled to grow at just 15% in 2023, showing their acceleration has slowed. On the positive front, they will be EBITDA contributing in 2023, with $41m booked for 2023.  
IMG Arena - part of the $EDR (Endeavor Group) which owns the UFC. Sports data is only a fraction of their main business  
Stats Perform - not a public company but one of the leaders considering their partnerships with the Premier League  
Take a look at this graphic and how beaten up these stocks are.  
https://ibb.co/v1Q6yPh  
I’m thinking that only a slight shift in the supply metrics could lead to an increase in profits, especially for the market incumbent $SRAD. A boost to their revenues over $1bn in 2023 and a CAGR of 25%, could see a new valuation multiple of 6X revenues instead of the current 3X. I figure the market doesn’t know how to value sports data companies yet.

881,stocks,"* PayPal is a huge player in the industry, and it has a favorable financial profile.
* Block controls two powerful ecosystems that have long expansionary runways. 
* Investors need to figure out if they care more about value or growth.

# In the battle of these payment companies, which one stands out?

PayPal (PYPL -0.26%) and Block (SQ -0.59%) are leaders in the lucrative digital payments industry. Each has carved out a valuable niche in the broader sector, and they have proven to be pioneers in displacing cash. Shares of both are down big from their peaks, presenting investors with a potential opportunity.

Which one of these top fintech stocks is the better one to own? Let's look at the investment merits of both PayPal and Block before coming to a conclusion.

# PayPal: A digital payments giant with strong financials

With 433 million active accounts and $1.36 trillion in 2022 total payment volume, PayPal is an industry juggernaut. It is not only a popular service that allows merchants to accept cashless payments but the most ubiquitous digital wallet, with a huge lead over second-place Apple Pay. In fact, PayPal is accepted by 79% of the top 1,500 online merchants across North America and Europe.

During the worst of the pandemic, when consumers were flush with cash and spending more money online, PayPal boomed. But as things normalized, coupled with the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, growth has slowed dramatically. Revenue in the first quarter of 2023 (ended March 31) was up 8.6% year over year, a sharp deceleration from the double-digit percentage gains of a couple of years ago.

However, this business possesses a wonderful financial profile, with net cash on its balance sheet of $4.4 billion (as of March 31). Over the past five years, the company's quarterly operating margin averaged 16%. And in 2022, PayPal generated $5.1 billion of free cash flow, with the expectation to produce $5 billion this year.

PayPal shares are currently 79% off their all-time high. And they are down 7% in 2023, while the Nasdaq Composite Index has jumped 30%. As a result, the stock trades at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 and a forward P/E of 13. Based on the stock's historical valuation, this is a very attractive entry point for investors to buy the leader in electronic payments.

# Block: Two budding ecosystems with huge growth potential

Block's original business plan was based on making it possible for smaller merchants to accept card payments. Today, this is known as the Square segment, which processed $46.2 billion in gross payment volume (GPV) in the first three months of 2023. A key trend that has benefited this division is Square's ability to attract large merchants or those that handle annualized GPV of at least $500,000.

On the other side of the equation, Block also has a compelling personal finance offering known as Cash App, which has 53 million monthly active users. Customers can send or receive money, set up direct deposit, or buy stocks and Bitcoin. Cash App registered a gross profit of $931 million in the last quarter, up 49% compared to the first quarter of 2022.

Block's growth strategy centers on launching new product and service features, as well as entering new markets. The company currently operates in the U.S., Australia, U.K, Japan, Spain, Canada, and France, so it does have notable international exposure and the potential for more. Looking at the bigger picture, the management team thinks Block's total addressable market (in terms of gross profit) is $120 billion, up significantly from previous estimates.

As of this writing, Block's stock is down 77% from its peak price in August 2021. As the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to fight inflation, investors have soured on growth tech stocks, a category that Block occupies. Although Block posted a $553 million net loss in 2022, Wall Street analysts expect the business to start producing positive and rising net income this year.

# It's all about what investors prioritize

PayPal has a valid investment case thanks to its strong financial profile, increasing engagement, and low valuation. And this might be enticing for some investors who want a more mature, cash-generative business.

Block might catch the eye of investors who are more interested in sizable growth prospects. Additionally, if you are bullish on Bitcoin but aren't comfortable buying it directly, Block could give you the exposure you are looking for through its Cash App and other Bitcoin-focused segments.

It's ultimately up to you to decide what aspects are more important to the investment decision.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PayPal is a huge player in the industry, and it has a favorable financial profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block controls two powerful ecosystems that have long expansionary runways. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors need to figure out if they care more about value or growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;In the battle of these payment companies, which one stands out?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPal (PYPL -0.26%) and Block (SQ -0.59%) are leaders in the lucrative digital payments industry. Each has carved out a valuable niche in the broader sector, and they have proven to be pioneers in displacing cash. Shares of both are down big from their peaks, presenting investors with a potential opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which one of these top fintech stocks is the better one to own? Let&amp;#39;s look at the investment merits of both PayPal and Block before coming to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;PayPal: A digital payments giant with strong financials&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 433 million active accounts and $1.36 trillion in 2022 total payment volume, PayPal is an industry juggernaut. It is not only a popular service that allows merchants to accept cashless payments but the most ubiquitous digital wallet, with a huge lead over second-place Apple Pay. In fact, PayPal is accepted by 79% of the top 1,500 online merchants across North America and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the worst of the pandemic, when consumers were flush with cash and spending more money online, PayPal boomed. But as things normalized, coupled with the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, growth has slowed dramatically. Revenue in the first quarter of 2023 (ended March 31) was up 8.6% year over year, a sharp deceleration from the double-digit percentage gains of a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this business possesses a wonderful financial profile, with net cash on its balance sheet of $4.4 billion (as of March 31). Over the past five years, the company&amp;#39;s quarterly operating margin averaged 16%. And in 2022, PayPal generated $5.1 billion of free cash flow, with the expectation to produce $5 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPal shares are currently 79% off their all-time high. And they are down 7% in 2023, while the Nasdaq Composite Index has jumped 30%. As a result, the stock trades at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 and a forward P/E of 13. Based on the stock&amp;#39;s historical valuation, this is a very attractive entry point for investors to buy the leader in electronic payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Block: Two budding ecosystems with huge growth potential&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Block&amp;#39;s original business plan was based on making it possible for smaller merchants to accept card payments. Today, this is known as the Square segment, which processed $46.2 billion in gross payment volume (GPV) in the first three months of 2023. A key trend that has benefited this division is Square&amp;#39;s ability to attract large merchants or those that handle annualized GPV of at least $500,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the equation, Block also has a compelling personal finance offering known as Cash App, which has 53 million monthly active users. Customers can send or receive money, set up direct deposit, or buy stocks and Bitcoin. Cash App registered a gross profit of $931 million in the last quarter, up 49% compared to the first quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Block&amp;#39;s growth strategy centers on launching new product and service features, as well as entering new markets. The company currently operates in the U.S., Australia, U.K, Japan, Spain, Canada, and France, so it does have notable international exposure and the potential for more. Looking at the bigger picture, the management team thinks Block&amp;#39;s total addressable market (in terms of gross profit) is $120 billion, up significantly from previous estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, Block&amp;#39;s stock is down 77% from its peak price in August 2021. As the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to fight inflation, investors have soured on growth tech stocks, a category that Block occupies. Although Block posted a $553 million net loss in 2022, Wall Street analysts expect the business to start producing positive and rising net income this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;It&amp;#39;s all about what investors prioritize&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPal has a valid investment case thanks to its strong financial profile, increasing engagement, and low valuation. And this might be enticing for some investors who want a more mature, cash-generative business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Block might catch the eye of investors who are more interested in sizable growth prospects.

I'm not sure what the numbers would be if it passes, but if it doesn't, the average payment is going to be $350/month.  With 40M borrowers, that's $14B/month total in student loan payments.  Some think that this will have a negative effect on the economy and markets.  Sure, it will affect discretionary, consumer spending.  Some of that money is probably going into markets as well.  I think that it could have a small effect, but not as big as others are predicting.  $14B/month is a good chunk of money, but is peanuts compared to the $95B/month that the Fed is doing in QT and the $900B in new debt issuance that the Treasury still needs to do before October.

Although, I just thought of something else...

There could be some people out there that have been saving up the money that they would have used for student load payments.  $350/month over 3 years is $12.6k.  There could be some people out there that thought, ""Gee whiz.  Even though payments are on pause, I should still pay down my loans.  However, $10k of my loans might get forgiven, and I wouldn't want to pay off something that is going to get wiped away. So.... I'll take $10k and save/invest it.

Now, I don't have a lot of faith in the financial responsibility of the US population, but let's say that a meager 10% of borrowers (4M) did this.  That would translate to $40B.

My valuation will be quite different from many company analysis usually seen on this subreddit as personally, I can't be bothered to read what a company actually does. I'm more interested in its financial statements. If they pass my napkin math hurdle rate of return, then maybe I'll actually read their investor presentation. To start off, let's look at JD.com.

This information was taken off of tikr. I was a little confused by their currency translation as going from RMB to USD, the revenue growth numbers were different. As a result, I just took their RMB information and multiplied it by 0.14, the current exchange rate.

The current market cap for JD is 53.64B. As we can see, JD has an astonishing 30.8B in cash with a net debt of 26.5B. After subtracting out their cash, we get a market cap of 27B.

To reiterate, their EBITDA was 3.6B. This gives us an EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.5 which is obviously crazy low. Using statista.com, we can see that the EV/EBITDA for the sp500 consumer discretionary sector is 14.44, about 92% higher. 

What could JD look like in 5 years? Let's put in some assumptions: Given that retail is not known for its high growth rates and profit margins are razor thin and our goal is not to lose money, we should be pretty conservative. We'll assume a 4% revenue CAGR and a 1.5% EBITDA margin, 10% less than their 5 yr avg. We'll also assume an exit multiple of 13x, 10% less than the 2022 sp500 avg and no share dilution. In exchange for us putting our money into this stock, we'll expect a return of 15% annually. Here's the numbers:

Given our assumptions, JD isn't that great of an investment and we should wait for it to drop lower before buying. 

What about if we're more bullish on the stock? We'll upgrade our multiple to 14.4x and increase our revenue growth assumptions to 10% and our EBITDA margin to 2.25%.

Unfortunately, JD would still be considered not a buy as it would need to drop 6% as of today's closing price of $34 to be considered a buy.

In conclusion, while JD seems extraordinarily cheap, it would need to have incredible growth over the next five years to justify buying it at its current share price. Factor in geopolitical tensions and general distrust of chinese stocks, JD is unfortunately not a buy with simple napkin math.

&lt;p&gt;This information was taken off of tikr. I was a little confused by their currency translation as going from RMB to USD, the revenue growth numbers were different. As a result, I just took their RMB information and multiplied it by 0.14, the current exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current market cap for JD is 53.64B. As we can see, JD has an astonishing 30.8B in cash with a net debt of 26.5B. After subtracting out their cash, we get a market cap of 27B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, their EBITDA was 3.6B. This gives us an EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.5 which is obviously crazy low. Using statista.com, we can see that the EV/EBITDA for the sp500 consumer discretionary sector is 14.44, about 92% higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could JD look like in 5 years? Let&amp;#39;s put in some assumptions: Given that retail is not known for its high growth rates and profit margins are razor thin and our goal is not to lose money, we should be pretty conservative. We&amp;#39;ll assume a 4% revenue CAGR and a 1.5% EBITDA margin, 10% less than their 5 yr avg. We&amp;#39;ll also assume an exit multiple of 13x, 10% less than the 2022 sp500 avg and no share dilution. In exchange for us putting our money into this stock, we&amp;#39;ll expect a return of 15% annually. Here&amp;#39;s the numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given our assumptions, JD isn&amp;#39;t that great of an investment and we should wait for it to drop lower before buying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about if we&amp;#39;re more bullish on the stock? We&amp;#39;ll upgrade our multiple to 14.4x and increase our revenue growth assumptions to 10% and our EBITDA margin to 2.25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, JD would still be considered not a buy as it would need to drop 6% as of today&amp;#39;s closing price of $34 to be considered a buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while JD seems extraordinarily cheap, it would need to have incredible growth over the next five years to justify buying it at its current share price. Factor in geopolitical tensions and general distrust of chinese stocks, JD is unfortunately not a buy with simple napkin math.&lt;/p&gt;

The union representing UPS workers has warned that a strike is ""imminent"" if the company doesn't come to the table with a significantly improved financial offer by Friday.

The Teamsters union, which represents about 340,000 UPS workers, has been negotiating with UPS for months on a new contract. But talks have stalled, according to the labor union, which called UPS' latest counteroffer on pay ""insulting."" 

Earlier this week, Teamsters gave the company a deadline of Friday, June 30, to bring its ""last, best and final offer"" to the table, putting pressure on negotiations ahead of what could be the largest single-company strike in U.S. history.

The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week by the most in 20 months, offering an upbeat picture of the labor market that could see the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates to cool demand.  
  
The unexpected decline in applications reported by the Labor Department on Thursday reversed a recent jump, which had left initial jobless claims over the prior three weeks hovering at levels last seen in October 2021.  
  
The elevated readings had led some economists to conclude that layoffs were picking up as the economy starts to feel the impact of the Federal Reserve's hefty interest rate increases. The U.S. central bank, which has raised its policy rate by 500 basis points since March 2022, signaled this month that two additional rate hikes were likely warranted this year.  
  
""For now, there is no sign of a substantial deterioration in demand for workers,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.  
  
""A tight labor market will keep the rate path on an upward trajectory, until policymakers see a material rebalancing in supply and demand."" Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 239,000 for the week ended June 25. The drop was the largest since October 2021.  
  
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 265,000 claims for the latest week.  
  
Recent policy changes in Minnesota making tens of thousands of hourly paid school workers eligible for state unemployment benefits during the summer break accounted for some of the increase in claims in the first three months of June. Fraud in some states was also probably an issue.

Unadjusted claims dropped 17,843 to 233,048 last week. Claims tumbled 10,108 in California and plunged 9,187 in Texas. They dropped 3,263 in Pennsylvania, while Minnesota reported a 2,387 decline in applications. These decreases offset a 6,013 surge in Connecticut and a 5,206 jump in New Jersey.  
  
Claims, relative to the size of the labor market, are well below the 280,000 level that some economists say would signal a significant slowdown in job growth. Employment growth has averaged 314,000 jobs per month this year.  
  
Job growth is being driven by the services sector, including the leisure and hospitality category, which is still catching up after businesses struggled to find workers over the last two years. Industries like healthcare and education also experienced accelerated retirements during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, fell 19,000 to 1.742 million during the week ending June 17, the lowest level since February, the claims report showed. The so-called continuing claims are low by historical norms, indicating that some laid-off workers were experiencing shorter spells of unemployment.  
  
A survey from the Conference Board this week showed consumers' perception of the labor market was upbeat in June, with more viewing jobs as ""plentiful"" relative to May, and a slight decline in the share who believed that jobs were ""hard to get.""  
  
Continuing claims covered the period during which the government surveyed households for June's unemployment rate. Continuing claims fell between the May and June survey periods. The unemployment rate was at 3.7% in May.  
  
Labor market strength helped to prop up in the economy in the first quarter, through an acceleration in consumer spending, which offset the drag from a sharp slowdown in the pace of inventory investment by businesses.  
  
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.0% annualized rate last quarter, the Commerce Department said in its third estimate of first-quarter GDP on Thursday.  
  
The upward revision from the 1.3% pace reported last month reflected upgrades to consumer spending and exports.  
  
The economy grew at a 2.6% pace in the fourth quarter. Economists had expected first-quarter GDP growth would be raised slightly to a 1.4% pace.  
  
Corporate profit estimates were also revised higher to show a slower pace of decline than initially reported.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-124634832.html""&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-124634832.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Swedish electric vehicle maker Polestar said Thursday that it has signed a deal with Tesla that will allow drivers of its EVs to charge at about 12,000 Tesla charging stations in North America starting next year. New Polestar vehicles sold in North America will come standard with the Tesla-designed North American Charging Standard, or NACS, plug starting in 2025. Owners of existing Polestars will be able to charge at Tesla’s Supercharger stations with an adapter starting in mid-2024.

Polestar’s deal follows an identical one announced by corporate sibling Volvo Cars on Tuesday. Ford Motor, General Motors and Rivian have also announced similar deals with Tesla in recent weeks. “We salute the pioneering work Tesla has done to speed up the adoption and increase the popularity of electric vehicles, and it’s great to see the Supercharger network being made available in this way,” said CEO Thomas Ingenlath. “This move will greatly increase the rate of EV adoption in a key automotive region.”

Most non-Tesla EVs and charging stations in North America use a plug design called CCS, which stands for Combined Charging System. Recent studies have found that CCS charging networks have much lower reliability than Tesla’s network. Critics have also noted that the CCS fast-charging plug is significantly larger and heavier than the NACS plug, making it difficult for some older or disabled drivers to use.   Tesla EVs can use CCS chargers with an adapter, but currently only Tesla EVs can use Tesla chargers. Tesla’s plug design was proprietary until November, when the company published the technical details of its system and made it available to other automakers and makers of EV chargers.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/polestar-moves-to-tesla-charging-standard.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/polestar-moves-to-tesla-charging-standard.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

894,stocks,"The U.S. economy showed much stronger-than-expected growth in the first quarter than previously thought, according to a big upward revision Thursday from the Commerce Department.

Gross domestic product increased at a 2% annualized pace for the January-through-March period, up from the previous estimate of 1.3% and ahead of the 1.4% Dow Jones consensus forecast. This was the third and final estimate for Q1 GDP. The growth rate was 2.6% in the fourth quarter.

The upward revision helps undercut widespread expectations that the U.S. is heading toward a recession.

According to a summary from the department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, the change came in large part because both consumer expenditures and exports were stronger than previously thought.

Consumer spending, as gauged by personal consumption expenditures, rose 4.2%, the highest quarterly pace since the second quarter of 2021. At the same time, exports rose 7.8% after falling 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022.

An 8.7% boost in the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment likely boosted the consumer spending numbers, said Scott Hoyt, senior director at Moody’s Analytics.

“Overall, however, the economy remains admirably resilient, and odds of a recession beginning this year are receding. But the coast is far from clear,” he said.

There also was some good news on the inflation front.

Core PCE prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 4.9% in the period, a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point. The all-times price index increased 3.8%, unchanged from the last estimate.

Federal Reserve policymakers most closely watch core PCE as an inflation indicator. Through a series of rate increases, the Fed is trying to get inflation back down to 2%.

The rate hikes are targeted at slowing down an economy that in the summer of 2022 was generating inflation at the highest level since the early 1980s.

One specific focus for the Fed has been the labor market. There currently are about 1.7 open positions for every available worker, and the tightness has resulted in a push higher for wages which generally have not kept pace with inflation.

“Obviously, while the baseline forecast calls for the economy to skirt recession, risks are extremely high. It would take little to push the economy into recession,” Hoyt said.

A separate report Thursday from the Labor Department pointed showed that initial jobless claims fell to 239,000 for the week ended June 24. That was a decline of 26,000 from the previous week and well below the estimate for 264,000.

903,stocks,"All 23 US banks that participated in a new Federal Reserve stress test would be able to withstand a severe global recession, demonstrating the strength of the biggest financial institutions at a time when the banking industry still is on uncertain ground.

Results released by the Fed Wednesday show that these banks would have enough capital on hand to absorb losses and continue lending even if unemployment were to hit 10% and the stock market were to plunge 45%.

Their projected losses would amount to $541 billion under that hypothetical scenario.

The biggest of the group - JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) – all would have capital buffers well in excess of the Fed’s 4.5% minimum requirement under this extreme scenario.

Same goes for the mid-sized regional banks that were a part of this test, including PNC (PNC), Truist (TFC) and M&amp;T (MTB).

""Today’s results confirm that the banking system remains strong and resilient,"" Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said.

""At the same time, this stress test is only one way to measure that strength. We should remain humble about how risks can arise and continue our work to ensure that banks are resilient to a range of economic scenarios, market shocks, and other stresses.""

Results did vary widely across the industry, however. The bank with the highest capital ratio under the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario” was Charles Schwab (SCHW), one of the lenders that came under a lot of investor scrutiny earlier this year as other banks stumbled.

The bank with the lowest ratio was Citizens Financial (CFG), a regional bank based in Rhode Island. Other banks with the smallest capital buffers were regional institutions that pale in size next to the giants of the industry.

But the giants also posted the biggest projected net income losses under the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario,” led by Citigroup's $34.9 billion. Wells Fargo had $32.9 billion and JPMorgan had $30.1 billion.

Goldman, perhaps the most storied name on Wall Street, had the highest amount of estimated losses from commercial estate loans and credit cards.

It also recorded the highest losses in separate Fed assessments of how the trading books of the biggest banks would perform under “global and exploratory market shocks.”



The Fed’s test, an annual rite of the industry since the 2008 financial crisis, is the first to be released since turmoil roiled the banking world following the failure of First Republic, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank this spring.

Banks typically use the results of the annual Fed stress tests to determine how much they should have on their balance sheet to absorb shocks and how much they have left over for dividends and buybacks. Later this summer, however, they are also bracing for a new set of higher capital requirements from the Fed that will force some of them to hold even greater buffers against losses.

These tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional banks in the spring, but regulators made it clear in the wake of those troubles that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to mid-sized institutions similar in size to a First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.

Forcing banks to amass greater buffers has pros and cons for lenders, regulators and the economy. It will increase the stability of these institutions, but it will also make it more difficult to earn robust profits and could cause banks to pull back on certain types of lending.

Powell discussed this balance last week.

“It’s always a trade-off,” he said. “More capital means more stable, resilient banking systems. It can also at the margins mean less credit availability…there is no perfect way to assess that balance.”

Barr, the vice chair of supervision, said last week the Fed is also exploring ""reverse stress testing"" that could be used as a tool to make banks more resilient by helping supervisors recognize more exogenous issues that could go wrong instead of patterns from the past regulators have been trained to catch.


The Fed first started applying stress tests to a wide group of banks in 2009, as the last financial crisis was still raging.

It was mandated annually by law for institutions with more than $100 billion in assets as part of legislation that passed in 2010. A law passed in 2018 tailored the tests by banks’ size, meaning those in the range of $100-$250 billion would be tested every other year.

Democrats and regulators have been critical of that 2018 adjustment, arguing it could have helped prevent the problems that amassed at Silicon Valley Bank, which had not gone through a stress test before it failed.

Some in this year's test — BMO Financial, Citizens, M&amp;T and RBC US Group — were among the every-other-year banks that weren’t scheduled to be tested again until 2024.

But the Fed required BMO, Citizens and M&amp;T to be tested again in 2023, and RBC also opted in to the 2023 exam. All four banks had capital of 6.4% and higher, above the 4.5% required.

This year the Fed examined how 23 banks would fare under a severe global recession that included severe stress in commercial real estate. In such a scenario unemployment spikes to 10%, home prices and commercial real estate plunge about 40%, the stock market plummets 45%, market volatility jumps and corporate bond yields rise.

All 23 banks in aggregate would have lost $541 billion. Yet they would still have capital equal to 10.1% of total assets weighted by risk. Well above the 4.5% the Fed requires.


The $541 billion in total projected losses include more $100 billion from commercial real estate and residential mortgages and $120 billion in credit card losses, both higher than the losses projected in last year’s test.

The banks with the biggest commercial real estate losses were Goldman, with $16 billion, followed by Morgan Stanley ($13.7 billion) and Citizens ($12.4 billion).

Goldman also had the highest credit card losses, with $24.7 billion, followed by Capital One ($22.2 billion) and TD Group ($21.4 billion).

Banks with large trading operations were also tested against a ""global market shock"" tied to their trading positions. For the first time, this year's test also added a second “exploratory market shock” to the trading books of the largest and most complex banks.

The global market shock is characterized by a severe recession with fading inflation expectations; the exploratory market shock tests a less severe recession with greater inflationary pressures induced by higher inflation expectations.

The results from those exams showed that the trading books of the largest banks were resilient amid a rising rate environment.

The biggest projected losses belonged to Goldman, with $21.2 billion lost in the global market shock scenario and $18.1 billion in the exploratory market shock component.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/all-23-banks-survive-feds-2023-stress-test-203007760.html","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 23 US banks that participated in a new Federal Reserve stress test would be able to withstand a severe global recession, demonstrating the strength of the biggest financial institutions at a time when the banking industry still is on uncertain ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results released by the Fed Wednesday show that these banks would have enough capital on hand to absorb losses and continue lending even if unemployment were to hit 10% and the stock market were to plunge 45%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their projected losses would amount to $541 billion under that hypothetical scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest of the group - JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) – all would have capital buffers well in excess of the Fed’s 4.5% minimum requirement under this extreme scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same goes for the mid-sized regional banks that were a part of this test, including PNC (PNC), Truist (TFC) and M&amp;amp;T (MTB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Today’s results confirm that the banking system remains strong and resilient,&amp;quot; Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;At the same time, this stress test is only one way to measure that strength. We should remain humble about how risks can arise and continue our work to ensure that banks are resilient to a range of economic scenarios, market shocks, and other stresses.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results did vary widely across the industry, however. The bank with the highest capital ratio under the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario” was Charles Schwab (SCHW), one of the lenders that came under a lot of investor scrutiny earlier this year as other banks stumbled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank with the lowest ratio was Citizens Financial (CFG), a regional bank based in Rhode Island. Other banks with the smallest capital buffers were regional institutions that pale in size next to the giants of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the giants also posted the biggest projected net income losses under the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario,” led by Citigroup&amp;#39;s $34.9 billion. Wells Fargo had $32.9 billion and JPMorgan had $30.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, perhaps the most storied name on Wall Street, had the highest amount of estimated losses from commercial estate loans and credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also recorded the highest losses in separate Fed assessments of how the trading books of the biggest banks would perform under “global and exploratory market shocks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed’s test, an annual rite of the industry since the 2008 financial crisis, is the first to be released since turmoil roiled the banking world following the failure of First Republic, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank this spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks typically use the results of the annual Fed stress tests to determine how much they should have on their balance sheet to absorb shocks and how much they have left over for dividends and buybacks. Later this summer, however, they are also bracing for a new set of higher capital requirements from the Fed that will force some of them to hold even greater buffers against losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional banks in the spring, but regulators made it clear in the wake of those troubles that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to mid-sized institutions similar in size to a First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forcing banks to amass greater buffers has pros and cons for lenders, regulators and the economy. It will increase the stability of these institutions, but it will also make it more difficult to earn robust profits and could cause banks to pull back on certain types of lending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powell discussed this balance last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s always a trade-off,” he said. “More capital means more stable, resilient banking systems. It can also at the margins mean less credit availability…there is no perfect way to assess that balance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barr, the vice chair of supervision, said last week the Fed is also exploring &amp;quot;reverse stress testing&amp;quot; that could be used as a tool to make banks more resilient by helping supervisors recognize more exogenous issues that could go wrong instead of patterns from the past regulators have been trained to catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed first started applying stress tests to a wide group of banks in 2009, as the last financial crisis was still raging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was mandated annually by law for institutions with more than $100 billion in assets as part of legislation that passed in 2010. A law passed in 2018 tailored the tests by banks’ size, meaning those in the range of $100-$250 billion would be tested every other year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democrats and regulators have been critical of that 2018 adjustment, arguing it could have helped prevent the problems that amassed at Silicon Valley Bank, which had not gone through a stress test before it failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some in this year&amp;#39;s test — BMO Financial, Citizens, M&amp;amp;T and RBC US Group — were among the every-other-year banks that weren’t scheduled to be tested again until 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Fed required BMO, Citizens and M&amp;amp;T to be tested again in 2023, and RBC also opted in to the 2023 exam. All four banks had capital of 6.4% and higher, above the 4.5% required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year the Fed examined how 23 banks would fare under a severe global recession that included severe stress in commercial real estate. In such a scenario unemployment spikes to 10%, home prices and commercial real estate plunge about 40%, the stock market plummets 45%, market volatility jumps and corporate bond yields rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All 23 banks in aggregate would have lost $541 billion. Yet they would still have capital equal to 10.1% of total assets weighted by risk. Well above the 4.5% the Fed requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $541 billion in total projected losses include more $100 billion from commercial real estate and residential mortgages and $120 billion in credit card losses, both higher than the losses projected in last year’s test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The banks with the biggest commercial real estate losses were Goldman, with $16 billion, followed by Morgan Stanley ($13.7 billion) and Citizens ($12.4 billion).&lt;/p&gt;

**About 80% of Google’s video-ad placements on third-party sites violated promised standards, new research shows; Google disputes claims.**

Google violated its promised standards when placing video ads on other websites, according to new research that raises questions about the transparency of the tech giant’s online-ad business.

Google’s YouTube runs ads on its own site and app. But the company also brokers the placement of video ads on other sites across the web through a program called Google Video Partners. Google charges a premium, promising that the ads it places will run on high-quality sites, before the page’s main video content, with the audio on, and that brands will only pay for ads that aren’t skipped. 

Google violates those standards about 80% of the time, according to research from Adalytics, a company that helps brands analyze where their ads appear online. The firm accused the company of placing ads in small, muted, automatically-played videos off to the side of a page’s main content, on sites that don’t meet Google’s standards for monetization, among other violations.

Adalytics compiled its data by observing campaigns from more than 1,100 brands that got billions of ad impressions between 2020 and 2023. The company shared its findings with The Wall Street Journal.

In a statement, Google said the report “makes many claims that are inaccurate and doesn’t reflect how we keep advertisers safe.” The company said it has strict policies for the program that serves video ads on third-party sites. 

“As part of our brand safety efforts, we regularly remove ads from partner sites that violate our policies and we’ll take any appropriate actions once the full report is shared with us,” the company said.

Some ad buyers who have reviewed the research say they want their money back.

“This is an unacceptable breach of trust by YouTube,” said Joshua Lowcock, global chief media officer at ad agency UM Worldwide. “Google must fix this and fully refund clients for any fraud and impressions that failed to meet Google’s own policies.”

The Journal independently observed invalid ad placements such as those the research identified, but couldn’t confirm the extent of the phenomenon. Digital ad-buyers and engineers vouched for the research findings.

To complete its research, Adalytics worked with ad agencies to analyze their clients’ ad-buy placement reports. The company also analyzed data collected by companies that archive the web to find instances when ads ran on sites that didn’t meet the Google Video Partners requirements.


Campaign ads for Republican Sen. Mike Lee appeared in invalid placements, according to the research, and he was critical of Google.

Among the major brands whose Google video-ad placements weren’t in line with the promised standards were Johnson &amp; Johnson, American Express, Samsung, Sephora, Macy’s, Disney+ and The Wall Street Journal, according to Adalytics. It also affected ads for government agencies, including Medicare, the U.S. Army, the Social Security Administration, and the New York City municipal government. 

“CMS is concerned with reports of invalid ad placements by YouTube,” said a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

YouTube accounts for 8.3% of U.S. digital-video ad spending, according to research company Insider Intelligence. Marketers feel obligated to advertise on YouTube because of its size, several ad buyers said.

Google sells ad placements on third-party sites as part of bundles that include ads on YouTube itself.

didn’t disclose how much revenue came from Google Video Partners. Brands and ad agencies often aren’t aware that their ads have run on third-party sites, said several ad buyers. 

For every brand in Adalytics’ sample, more than half the budget they spent on the bundles went to non-YouTube properties, the research found. 

A Google spokesman said the overwhelming majority of the video ads it sells are served on YouTube—not third-party sites. Advertisers can clearly see that their ads might run on third-party sites, and how much is spent there, and can easily opt out, he said.

Brands typically pay about $100 for every 1,000 completed views of the ads on third-party sites, according to several ad-buyers. They pay the premium rate to avoid ad placements that are intrusive, such as those that load in the margins of the user’s desired content. Such lower-quality ads often sell for about $5 per 1,000 instances of ads, the buyers said.

“I feel cheated,” said Giovanni Sollazzo, founder, chairman and chief executive of digital-ad agency AIDEM. “What I requested to buy was not what I got. This should entitle me to a refund for invalid traffic.”

Ad placements appeared on low-quality sites that trafficked in misinformation or “clickbait” content, as well as those that appeared to publish pirated content, contrary to the promises of the Google Video Partners program, the researchers found.

The research raises questions about how Google vets the sites in its network, said Adalytics founder Krzysztof Franaszek, who authored the research.

The research underscores the opaqueness of the digital-ad market, where money flows are difficult to track and it is hard for brands to know that they are getting what they paid for. 

At least 23% of the $88 billion spent annually by marketers on automated digital ad buying on the open web is wasted, according to the Association of National Advertisers.

The Adalytics report “proves the lie in Google’s assertion that it has made digital advertising better for all involved,” said Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), after reviewing the research. “Advertisers and consumers will continue to suffer from Google’s rampant conflicts of interest and fraudulent conduct,” said Lee. His campaign ads also appeared in invalid placements, according to the research.

Marc Friedman, founder of digital-marketing consulting firm Mfried Consulting, said he planned to ask for compensation for ads that ran in the wrong places and format. “It’s just not being honest,” he said.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-violated-its-standards-in-ad-deals-research-finds-3e24e041""&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-violated-its-standards-in-ad-deals-research-finds-3e24e041&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re blaming lower spending from covid shots and consumer spending, but it&amp;#39;s not like it turned the stock around in 2020 or 2021 as it was still 50% from multi year high, now it&amp;#39;s around 70% (30% 52w high).&lt;/p&gt;
